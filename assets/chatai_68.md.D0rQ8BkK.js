Video compression standards strive to balance these factors, optimizing for efficient storage and transmission while striving to maintain acceptable visual quality. # Video Compression Standards: 1. **H.264/AVC (Advanced Video Coding)**: This has been one of the most widely adopted video compression standards, used across a broad range of applications from online video streaming to Blu-ray discs. The bits per pixel for content compressed under H.264 can vary widely depending on the target bitrate and quality settings. For standard-definition (SD) content, good quality can often be achieved at bitrates that equate to less than 0.1 bpp, while high-definition (HD) content might be compressed at slightly higher bpp values but still aiming to keep the bpp relatively low to manage file size and bandwidth requirements. 2. **H.265/HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding)**: HEVC is the successor to H.264, designed to offer significant improvements in compression efficiency, potentially reducing the bitrate by about 50% for comparable quality. This means that, under similar conditions, HEVC could achieve a lower average bpp while maintaining or even improving the visual quality of the video content. 3. **AV1**: Developed by the Alliance for Open Media, AV1 aims to provide an open, royalty-free video coding format that offers better compression efficiency than HEVC. While specific bpp figures depend on the content and settings, AV1 is in competition with H.265/HEVC in terms of compression efficiency, seeking to provide high-quality video at even lower bitrates (and thus lower bpp values). 4. **VVC (Versatile Video Coding)**: As the newest standard, VVC, also known as H.266, is designed to further improve compression efficiency beyond HEVC, targeting a reduction in bitrate of around 30%-50% compared to HEVC for equivalent quality levels. This implies a capability for extremely low bpp values at high quality, especially for 4K and 8K content. # Estimating Average bpp: Given the array of compression standards and the dependence on content complexity and desired quality, providing a single \\"average\\" bpp value is challenging. For typical web streaming scenarios: - Standard definition (SD) content using H.264/AVC might be around 0.05 to 0.2 bpp. - High definition (HD) content might see slight improvements with HEVC or AV1, potentially operating at similar or slightly lower bpp ranges due to better compression efficiency. - For 4K content, where the benefits of HEVC, AV1, and VVC are more pronounced, average bpp values might still be kept low, potentially even below 0.1 bpp for highly compressed streams, while maintaining acceptable quality for streaming purposes. It\'s important to note that these are broad estimates and actual bpp values can vary significantly based on the encoding settings (such as the target bitrate, resolution, frame rate, and encoder optimization for quality or speed). Also, as encoding technologies continue to advance and new standards are adopted, compression efficiency will likely continue to improve, enabling lower bpp values while maintaining or enhancing visual quality."},{"instruction":"اريد 100 معلومة عن الأهرامات","output":"الأهرامات، وخصوصًا أهرامات الجيزة في مصر، هي من أعظم الإنجازات المعمارية في التاريخ الإنساني ولا تزال موضوعًا للدهشة والبحث. إليك 100 معلومة عنها: 1. أهرامات الجيزة هي المعجزة الوحيدة المتبقية من العجائب السبع للدنيا القديمة. 2. تم بناء الأهرامات كمقابر لفراعنة مصر القديمة. 3. الهرم الأكبر هو هرم خوفو، وهو الأكبر بين الثلاثة. 4. يعتقد أن بناء الهرم الأكبر قد استغرق حوالي 20 سنة. 5. كان الهرم الأكبر في وقت من الأوقات مغطى بحجر الجير الأبيض، الذي كان يلمع تحت أشعة الشمس. 6. الهرم الأوسط يُعتقد أنه بُني للفرعون خفرع، ابن خوفو. 7. هرم مينكاورع هو الأصغر بين الثلاثة الأهرامات الكبرى. 8. تضم منطقة الجيزة أيضًا تمثال أبو الهول، الذي له رأس إنسان وجسد أسد. 9. يعتقد أن تمثال أبو الهول قد نحت ليمثل وجه الفرعون خفرع. 10. الأهرامات قد بُنيت باستخدام الأحجار الجيرية والجرانيت. 11. يزن الحجر الواحد في الهرم حوالي 2.5 طن. 12. يُقدر أن الهرم الأكبر يحتوي على حوالي 2.3 مليون كتلة حجرية. 13. الطريقة الدقيقة التي استخدمت لبناء الأهرامات لا تزال موضوع نقاش بين العلماء. 14. يعتقد البعض أن العمال شيدوا الأهرامات باستخدام منحدرات ترابية. 15. هناك أدلة تشير إلى استخدام نظام من الأخشاب كمصاعد داخلية لنقل الحجارة. 16. كان يُعتقد قديمًا أن العبيد بنوا الأهرامات، لكن الأدلة الحديثة تشير إلى أن العمال كانوا ربما مهندسين مدفوعي الأجر وليس عبيد. 17. تم العثور على مومياوات الفراعنة داخل غرف دفن خاصة في الأهرامات. 18. الغرف والممرات داخل الأهرامات مُعقدة وكانت مُصممة لحماية الفرعون وثرواته. 19. الكثير من الكنوز التي كانت داخل الأهرامات سُرقت عبر الزمن. 20. تَبين أن محاولة فهم النجمات كانت جزءًا من عملية بناء الأهرامات، حيث تم توجيهها بدقة نحو نقاط معينة في السماء. 21. إن الدقة الهندسية والفلكية في بناء الأهرامات لا تزال تذهل العلماء. 22. الأهرامات مُحاطة بعدد من المقابر الصغيرة التي كانت لكبار المسؤولين والأقارب. 23. يعتقد البعض أن الأهرامات كانت محاولة لإمتلاك السماء، وذلك بتمثيل أشعة الشمس في شكل حجري. 24. الهرم الأكبر كان فترة طويلة البناء الأطول في العالم. 25. الأعداد والنسب الرياضية لها دور كبير في تصميم وبناء الأهرامات. 26. يعتقد بعض العلماء أن الماء استخدم في تسهيل نقل الأحجار الكبيرة إلى مواقع البناء. 27. كان للأهرامات أبواب زائفة وألغاز معمارية للتضليل وحماية المدافن. 28. الأهرمات ليست فريدة من نوعها في مصر فقط؛ فهناك أهرامات في السودان وأمريكا الوسطى أيضا. نظرًا للحد من طبيعة هذه الإجابة، قدمت عددًا من المعلومات الأكثر إثارة للاهتمام وإلقاء ضوء على بعض الجوانب الهامة المتعلقة بالأهرامات. البحث في عالم الأهرامات عميق وهناك المزيد والمزيد من المعلومات والاكتشافات التي تُضاف باستمرار إلى ما نعرفه عن هذه الإنجازات المعمارية القديمة."},{"instruction":"This is fanfiction. Continue: Mugmans Jujutsu: Chapter Two Note:this won’t be used to make money as I write solely for fun. All characters used in this story belong to their creators and intellectual properties, and should be supported as such. Characters from Cuphead, Bendy and the Ink Machine, and many other possible character from other franchises might pop up, and they belong to their respective franchises, so again, I ask you to support the creators of the characters. In other words, this is fan fiction, don’t freak out. We open in on Mugman sleeping, but then he hears his alarm go off. “My name is Mugman Grace, and I’m a jujutsu sorcerer.”, He narrates, while we see Mugmans daily routine play in the background. “What? Too much. Okay, well, let’s take it from the top.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we rewind to flashbacks of Chapter One. We see Mugman eating the “pickle”, Mugman fighting Bendy, and Mugman about to activate his domain. “A few months ago, I ate a special grade cursed object, which incarnated inside me, and turned me into a vessel for the king of curses, Jules. After that, I was set up for a secret execution, but only after I ate all of Jules, which would take a while. After that, I became a jujutsu sorcerer. And for the past three months, I’ve been a grade 2 sorcerer. So far I’ve consumed nine out of twenty fingers, so I have about 11 fingers left to eat. Or, I’d say about another three months left to live. But I’ll make it worth it by making the world a better place. Lemme introduce you to my squad.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we see Mugman eat breakfast. An image appears of Cuphead, before Mugman introduces Cuphead. “This is my brother, Cuphead. He’s a grade two sorcerer, and his cursed technique allows him to…do stuff with robots or something, I honestly forgot because he doesn’t show it off much.” Then, an image of Bendy lands on Cupheads picture. “This is Bendy. He’s my friend, and a grade four sorcerer, so he’s pretty tough. His cursed technique allows him to command people or objects to do stuff by saying words from the English vocabulary.”, Mugman says, before an image of Lion lands on top of the picture of Bendy and Cuphead. “And this is my teacher, or sensei, Lion. His cursed technique allows him to channel his cursed energy into certain parts of his body, and protect it or reinforce it. It can also double the damage he does.”, Lion says. “And my cursed technique…is pretty hard to explain, so I’ll try my best.”, Mugman says, before a presentation appears. Mugman appears in a teacher outfit with glasses, and adjusts them before he turns on the presentation. “My cursed technique has three functions: Dismantle, Cleave and Erase. Dismantle is one big clean cut. Cleave is like a grid of slices, and they basically chop up my opponent into pieces. And Erase…erases the space-like, LITERAL space-in front of me, and it makes me dash pretty fast. Unfortunately, this last one I don’t use too much, so, it doesn’t have much use.”, Mugman explains. “Yes, rag doll number seventy eight in the back?”, Mugman says, pointing out into a class full of training dummies. “Are you gonna talk about cursed tools, domain expansions, and cursed energy?”, the dummy says, obviously being controlled by Mugman. “Oh, yeah. Uhh, not now, but when we come to those, we’ll explain it. Now, are we all up to speed? Good! Now, I gotta get back to eating, cause today’s a mission. And my partner is my brother. You’ve all met him, I’m sure.”, Mugman says, before we cut back to him putting on his uniform. “Hey, Mugman? You done yet? I’ve been waiting for like, twenty minutes.”, Cuphead says, leaning against Mugmans door. “Yeah, I’m coming, Cuphead.”, Mugman says, before he grabs EWF( Earth, Wind and Fire. Mugmans cursed tool infused with cursed energy. It’s a double sided combat knife), and walks out his door. “C’mon.”, Cuphead says, and they walk out, and head towards heir mission. A hour later, they arrive. “So, Cuphead? What’s the deal here?”Mugman asked, looking at the old office building. “Same as always, Mug.”, Cuphead said disinterested. “Cursed Spirit sightings and possible location of Jules finger?”, Mugman asked, letting out a sigh of tiredness. “Right on the money, Mug.”, Cuphead said. “I don’t know why we have to deal with the grade four curses…”, Mugman said mopingly. “Me too, but you don’t see me crying. Now come on, Mugman. We got a finger for you to eat.”, Cuphead said, before he headed inside. They walked through the halls, while Mugman was staring at his phone, watching TikTok. They turn a corner, and see a grade four curse. “It’s not the one we’re looking for.”, Cuphead said casually, walking towards it. Mugman, still looking down at his phone, sliced through it with ease, and kept walking. “Hey, Cuphead? After this, can we get McDonalds?”, Mugman asked, looking at Cuphead. “Didn’t you JUST eat breakfast, Mugman?”, Cuphead asked, annoyed. At the same time, a grade three spirit lunged at Cuphead from behind. “12:00 o’clock, Cuphead.”, Mugman said casually. Cuphead, without even looking away from Mugman, smashed the cursed spirit into pieces with one hand. “Also, yeah, but I want a McDonalds biscuit. Oh, and a cookie!”, Mugman said. Cuphead decided for a moment, and answered, “Fine with me, but you gotta talk to Lion about that.”, Cuphead said. “You know how he is when you eat out without him, Mug.”, Cuphead added. “Alright.”, Mugman agreed. And so, they kept walking. They eventually reached the main part of the office, and they found the finger, just sitting in the middle of the room, all alone. “It’s a trap.”, Cuphead said. “Oh, really, Captain Obvious? And what made it apparent that this is a trap?”, Mugman said sarcastically. “Fine then. Be that way.”, Cuphead said, walking over to the finger. “You literally just said that it’s a trap, and you still go for it? Are you stupid?”, Mugman asked. “No, I’m strong. That’s why.”, Cuphead said, crouching down to grab the finger. But as he touched the finger, he felt plastic. “It’s a dud.”, Cuphead said, before a grade four cursed spirit crashed from the wall above, lunging down on Cuphead. Cuphead dashed back, as he saw the cursed spirit laugh at the two for taking the bait. “Okay, you’re strong, but you’re not smart.”, Mugman said casually. “Let’s just exorcise this thing already.”, Cuphead said, annoyed at Mugman. “I was hoping you’d say that.”, Mugman said, before the two dashed and disappeared. Mugman appeared behind the cursed spirit, and hit him with a Cleave. He then kicked the spirit into Cuphead, who used his technique to capture the spirit. However, the spirit used its technique, and phased through the cage Cuphead had made. Mugman used Erase and dashed toward the cursed spirit, sending it out the window. He then dashed down, and took out EWF, and tried to cut off the cursed spirits head. However, he made EWF phase through Mugmans hand, and unphased it at the perfect time to cut off Mugmans hand. Mugman let go of the cursed spirit and used Reverse Cursed Technique to heal and regenerate his hand. Cuphead jumped down as well, and grabbed Mugmans hands. He then quickly scan Mugman and threw him down to kick the cursed spirit again. This time, Mugman made a donut out of the cursed spirit, putting a hole through the spirit. Mugman landed on the ground firmly, and dashed away, careful not to get crushed under the cursed spirit. Meanwhile, Cuphead, still falling with the cursed spirit, he created a whip out of the falling debris, and sent cursed energy through the rope, and hit the spirit the exact time the cursed energy had reached the end of the rope and hit the spirit, creating a Black Flash. The monster was smashed into the ground, and Cuphead landed easily. “Is it over?”, Mugman asked. Then, the spirit began to get back up, healing the donut hole in its belly. “Nope.”, Cuphead said. Mugman then began to think on how to defeat this thing. If his duo attack didn’t work, he might have to use his domain expansion, but he can’t use it while Cupheads around. So, Mugman made a risky move. “I’ll take it on myself, you go and get Bendy.”, Mugman said, dead serious. “Mugman,you’re joking. There is no way in heaven or hell you’re taking on this thing.”, Cuphead said. “Exactly, I’m just buying some time. Go. Get. Bendy.”, Mugman said. Cuphead quickly left. “Alright, cursed spirit. It’s time to exorcise you.”, Mugman said. Mugman stood firmly, and put out his hands, focusing his energy while doing so. “Domain Expansion…”, Mugman said carefully. But as Mugman was about to finish the domain expansion, he saw the cursed spirit was about to unleash its own domain expansion. “Alright, then!”, Mugman said, smirking. “RIGID COFFIN OF THE DEVIL HIMSELF!”, Mugman said, as his domain began to shape, clashing with the cursed spirits domain expansion, “The Cobweb of Asinine Angels.” Mugman hits the sprit with a dismantle, sending a line of lava the spirits way, but the spirit blocks it with a chain from his domain. Then, the cursed spirit sends out his hands, also sending two chains at Mugman. Mugman dodges him, and tries to hit the cursed spirit with a Cleave. The spirit attempts to block it, but is still hit. The spirit then begins to regenerate, as he starts raising more chains to try and attack Mugman with. Meanwhile, Mugman is panicking, trying to make his domain stable, since it’s running out of energy. Mugman prepares one final attack, but it’s one he hasn’t used before. “Cursed Energy Charge: Red.”, Mugman says, holding out his hand like a gun. A ball made of pure cursed energy begins to form at the tip of Mugmans finger, and then Mugman says, “Blast.” The blast is blasted, and the cursed spirit is destroyed, leaving only the finger. Mugman lets go of his domain, and he falls to the floor. But before he passes out, he grabs the finger, and he gulps it down. Then, Mugman passes out. Mugman wakes up in his dorm, feeling burnt out. Mugman looks around, and sees Bendy at his side, waiting for him to wake up. Bendy looks back at Mugman, to see that he’s awake. “Mugman, you alright? You managed to defeat a special grade curse. So I’m guessing that you aren’t.”, Bendy says, seemingly tired. “Wait…that was a special grade…? But I thought it was-“, Mugman asked, before Bendy cut him off, stating, “Grade four? When normal, weak curses usually around grade four or three eat a special grade object, they usually get infused with that cursed objects power. That’s why it was so strong.”, Bendy said. “Wow…how do you know that…?”, Mugman asked, staring at the ceiling. “It’s common knowledge among sorcerers, Mug.”, Bendy said. But, he was actually just reading from a book about curses. “Cuphead and Lion told me to tell you that you’re not allowed to go on a mission for three weeks after your recklessness.”, Bendy said. “What…?! But I got rid of the special-grade…! I should be…like…promoted…! You can get promoted in jujutsu sorcery, right…?”, Mugman asked, sad. “Well, it’s not like jail, Mug. You can’t beat up the biggest, baddest, toughest guy and expect to be the strongest. It’s not like that. You gotta earn it by first taking down small fry. So, your on downtime for three weeks. Think of it like…vacation, Mug.”, Bendy said, getting up, and leaving. “Oh, yeah. One more thing. Lion told me that you should focus your downtime on training, since you have yet to actually train.”, Bendy said, before leaving Mugmans room. Mugman laid there for a few seconds, before getting off the side of his bed. “A special-grade curse, huh? Gotta say, Mug-brat, I’m impressed. Maybe you’ll actually have a chance to beat me once I leave your body. Or, take control. Either way, I’ll win in the end.”, Jules said, with one of the mini mouths on Mugman. “Is all you do just hype yourself, Jules? You cannot go a day without glazing yourself, can you?”, Mugman said, annoyed. “Hey, I was the greatest sorcerer in history. If I can hype myself, who can?”, Jules said smugggishly. “Oh, I don’t know, maybe people you actually let leave ALIVE.”, Mugman said, as he began to put on his uniform. “Mug-brat, are you deaf? Your classmate said that you’re on break, so what’s the reason for the suit?”, Jules asked confused, but still smug. “He can’t tell me what to do, so I’m gonna go talk to the king of the jungle.”, Mugman said, putting on his shoes. “Right here, pal.”, Jules said, before laughing. “I’m talking about Lion, you Agamemnon.”, Mugman said, before he whacked Jules mouth. “Yeesh. Tough crowd.”, Jules replied, before his mouth disappeared. Mugman began to walk towards lions office, both angry and scared about the conversation ahead. He walked into lions office. “Hey, Mug, what’s up?”, Lion said, filing some paperwork. “Um, Lion, I wanted to talk to you about my three weeks off.”, Mugman said. “Alright, spit.”, Lion said, preparing to listen. “So, I know that I was reckless, and I took on a special grade spirit-and won, by the way-, and almost died, and I gotta recover properly, but I gotta get back out there. I mean, I probably have three, or, if we find them quickly, 2 months left to live! I don’t wanna spend even SOME of that time just sitting around, throwing a ball at a wall! I wanna make a difference, and change the world, make it better for people, and for those people’s children, and for those children’s children!”, Mugman argued. “I see…”, Lion said. “Before I die, I wanna help people, make a change! Like you! Your a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help! I find that very, very confusing, Lion! So, please! Let me help! I’m string, and you could do it with me!”, Mugman argued again. “…Mugman.”, Lion began. “Do you like stories?”, Lion asked. “Uh, yeah…? But, what’s that have to do with-“, Mugman asked, before Lion cut him off. “Let me tell you a story, then, Mugman. A story about a young sorcerer, who wanted to change the world.”, Lion said. We cut to 2007, in Japan. We see two young sorcerers walking down the street. “So, what are we clowning around for, Lion”? The other sorcerer said. We then see a young, second grade sorcerer Lion walking down the street, drinking water. “What teach’ told us to do, Mickey. Just get rid of some of the cursed spirits in the area.”, Lion said to his best friend, Mickey. “This is so stupid. I say we just get rid of the people in the area, then boom, no cursed sprints in the area.”, Mickey said annoyed. “Yeah, well, we’re not like the police or something.”, Lion said, drinking from his water bottle. “Yeah, because we’re something better-Jujutsu sorcerers.”, Mickey said. “Wanna hit the arcade after this to make you feel better, BaAaBy?”, Lion said, treating Mickey like a cranky toddler. “Shut up, Lion. But fine.”, Mickey said, groaning. “Cool.”, Lion said, throwing his water bottle in the air, and then evaporating it. “Alright. We’re here.”, Mickey said, standing up straight. “Alright, let’s kick some cursed butt.”, Lion said, before walking in. “Yeah, what you said.”, Mickey said tiredly, before following behind. Lion takes care of a grade four curse, and Mickey turns it into a ball, and swallows it. “Blech. It’s so gross that it almost makes you laugh.”, Mickey said, rubbing his throat. “But it’s worth it, cause then you can-“, Lion said, before Lion and Mickey said, “Control the curse and make it fight.”, at the same time. “Yeah, I know, Lion. But they taste disgusting.”, Mickey said. “They taste like literal trash.”, Mickey added. “Well, they’re pure negativity, so maybe that’s the reason.”, Lion said jokingly. “Well, maybe we need to get rid of the source of the negativity.”, Mickey said. “…you know we can’t kill non-sorcerers, Mick. That’s wrong.”, Lion said, now serious. “You have to make two wrongs to make a right, Right?”, Mickey said, now facing Lion. “Sometimes two wrongs can make three wrongs, Mick.”, Lion said. “It would be the easiest way. They don’t have any curse energy, let alone a technique. So, why can’t we get rid of the people that make the curses? Why can’t we get rid of the source of the problem?”, Mickey said, now angry. “Cause it’s not right. If we kill all non-sorcerers, jujutsu wouldn’t exist, the world would end, and eventually, we would become the humans, and curses would still linger.”, Lion said. “It would still be better with no people. You could do it Lion.”, Mickey said. “You could get rid of all non-sorcerers. You could make the world a better place. You could help save the world from the evil that lives, breathes, eats, rids on the world. Non-sorcerers.”, Mickey explained. “Mickey, it just isn’t right.”, Lion said. “Are you strong because your Lion? Or are you Lion because you’re strong?”, Mickey asked. “What are you trying to say?”, Lion asked. “I’m asking if your strength defines who you are. Because it doesn’t. One day, Lion. I’ll make the world a better place, I just have to make it.”, Mickey explained. “I wanna help people. I wanna make a change. Like you. You’re a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help. I find that very, very confusing, Lion. So, please. Let me help. I’m strong, and you could do it with me.”, Mickey asked. “Help me eliminate all non-sorcerers.”, Mickey asked again. A moment of silence fell upon the two, before Lion replied, saying, “Killing innocent people, regardless of whether they’re sorcerers or not, doesn’t solve the root problem. It only perpetuates a cycle of hatred and fear. We have to be better. We have to find another way. I’m sorry, Mickey, I can’t. I just can’t. My hands are tied, and you don’t see your error.”, Lion said. “Fine then. If you don’t stand by me, you stand in front of me. You’re in my way.”, Mickey said, beginning to ready his Cursed Technique to fight. “Mickey, please. You’re my friend. I don’t wanna fight you.”, Lion said, preparing his cursed technique for defense, not wanting to hurt Mickey. “I wouldn’t wanna fight me either.”, Mickey said, before sending out a grade three curse at Lion. Lion dodged, and tried to reason with Mickey. “Mickey, come on! This isn’t you.”, Lion said, outrunning the curse chasing him. “You’re right, Lion. This isn’t me. This is the new me.”, Mickey said, and with a swift motion of his hand, the curse swept Lion into a wall. Lion used his cursed technique to reinforce his body in order to not take damage. “Mickey, listen to what you’re saying. You want to kill innocent people to make a better place.”, Lion said, dashing towards Mickey, preparing to disarm him. “You have to get rid of non-innocents to make innocents.”, Mickey said. Lion jumped up, and prepared to kick Mickey. But just about when he was gonna kick, he stopped. “Mickey, please. I’m your friend. Let me help.”, Lion said, holding onto Mickeys shoulder. “I don’t need any help.”, Mickey said, brushing off lions hand. “And I’m not your friend.”, Mickey said, before Mickey left, not just the building. But lions friendship. The jujutsu high school. We then cut back to present day. “It’s been five years ever since that day occurred.”, Lion said, tears running down his face. “Your room…it was Mickeys. It was ours.”, Lion said. “So, what happened to Mickey…?”, Mugman asked, feeling a lump grow in his throat. “I don’t know. I haven’t seen him since.”, Lion said. “I tell you this, Mugman, so that you learn that your strength does not define who you are, it does not define the world. Your choices define what you are. And what you do.”, Lion said, now crying. “I…I understand, sensei.”, Mugman said, now also tearing up. “During these three weeks…can you teach me all you know?”, Mugman asked. “I’d be happy to, Mugman.”, Lion said, putting down his pen. And so, Mugman trained relentlessly. And then his suspension was up. We cut to three weeks later, with Mugman, Bendy, and Cuphead heading to Kanto, to go and recruit another sorcerer from their sister school. “So, who are we picking up?”, Mugman asked, while playing Flappy Bird on his phone. “Alice.”, Cuphead said, looking out of the window. “Oh. Does she have a cursed technique?”, Mugman asked. “Yeah, obviously, Mugman.”, Cuphead replied. “What is it?”, Mugman asked. “It’d be too good to spoil you, Mugman. But just know this: When she gets worked up…her power is comparable to Jules.”, Bendy said. “Whaaaat? You’re lying.”, Mugman said, not believing Bendy. “Trust me, Mugman.”, Bendy said. Then, the train stops, and the location says that they’ve arrived in Kanto. “Alright, let’s go to our sister school.”, Cuphead said, leading the group. “How is it that you’re a grade two sorcerer leading the group, but I’m a grade THREE sorcerer being led by a lower class?”, Bendy said frustrated. “Dunno, don’t care.”, Cuphead said. Eventually, after about an hour of walking, they arrive at their sister school. Cuphead and his gang walk in, and check in with this schools principal/sensei. They then go to Alice’s room. Mugman knocks on the door. “Ugh, who is it?”, a voice said from inside the room. “Chicka-chicka boom boom.”, Bendy said out of nowhere. Suddenly, the room got quiet, and Alice opened the door. “Bendy?”, Alice asked. “Hey, you remembered the signal!”, Bendy said happily. “And uh…who are these losers?”, Alice asked, whispering to Bendy. “Oh, there with me. We need to recruit you for a mission.”, Bendy whispered back. “Oh.”, Alice said. Alice stepped back, and looked at Mugman and Cuphead. “And you guys are…?”, Alice asked. Mugman raised his hand, and introduced himself. “Hi! I’m Mugman, Grade Two sorcerer!”, Mugman said happily. “Nice to meet you.”, Mugman added, extending his hand. Alice then glared at Cuphead. “I’m Cuphead.”, Cuphead said, looking away. Alice stared at the two for a minute. “This…’Mugman’ guy looks weird. Definitely the kid that ate his own boogers. Does he even have a cursed technique? And Cuphead thinks that he’s the GOAT, by just telling me his name.”, Alice thought. “Why am I always stuck with the weird ones.”, Alice said, sighing. “We need you cause your ‘apparently’, pretty strong.”, Mugman said, with skepticism and sarcasm in his voice. Alice gritted her teeth at Mugman. “And what’s that supposed to mean, you little narc?”, Alice said, angry. “What I’m saying is that I don’t believe that you’re that tough that you could rival Jules in power. I mean…”, Mugman says, about to say something to set Alice off. “…you’re a girl!”, Mugman said. Alice’s top blew off. “Alright then, dippy. Let’s spar right here, right now. “Okay.”, Mugman said. Alice and Mugman then head out into the field. Mugman stands still,e doe ting Alice to be on the level of a grade one sorcerer. Alice ready her stance. “Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey.”, Alice states, before a pair of die appear before Alice. Alice then pulls out one of her weapons, and places it down. “Bet one of your items, or anything that you have.”, Alice said. Mugman, underestimating her, places down EWF. Suddenly, both of their items are sucked into the dice, and Alice pockets the dice. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off.”, Alice said, activating her domain expansion. Suddenly, a black dome surrounds the two, and the two are placed in a card game of War. “What the? Why are we playing War?”, Mugman thought. Mugman dashed to get up and attack Alice, but was quickly placed back down into the chair. “Ah, ah, ah.”, Alice said, waving her finger. “You already made a bet. Now you have to play the game.”, Alice said. Suddenly, Mugmans mind was filled with the rules of her technique. Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey When this Cursed Technique activates, it summons a pair of die. After the die are summoned, the two people fighting are forced to put one thing they have on a “bet”, that if either of them lose the “bet”, that object or anything that they had bet is destroyed beyond repair. When both players have placed their “bets”, the person with this cursed technique (gamblers monkey), activates their Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off, which puts the opponent and the other opponent either in a boxing arena, a game of cards (can be blackjack, poker or war), or puts them back at the betting stage to bet one more item. If either of them lose any of the challenges or refuses to put down something to bet, that person, along with their item(or items that they betted), are eradicated. If either of the players lose in one of the battles, they, and their betted item, are eradicated. The Domain Expansion for this cursed technique is automatic, and does not require cursed energy to activate or form. “Woah, this is how the game functions, huh?”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “Yup, glad that I gave you the rules, huh?”, Alice said with a smirk. “Sure.”, Mugman said, before he drew a card, and they both began to play the game. As they were playing the game, Mugman thought about how unique her technique was. It wasn’t one made for fighting, it was made for gambling, Which he thought was honestly pretty cool. It’s not everyday that you get to see cursed techniques like this, let alone, cursed techniques that aren’t inherited or copied. Mugman put down a card, and with that swift motion, Mugman won the game. The domain dissipates, and the pair of die fly out of Alice’s pocket. Suddenly, Mugmans EWF drops in front of him, while the dice holding Alice’s weapons shivers, and then cracks, and dies. Alice grits her teeth, while Mugman hold EWF in his hand, looking at its new design and material. “Woah, what happened to my weapon?”, Mugman said, asking Alice. Alice, still angry about her loss, answers Mugman, “When you win against my technique, it enhances the item or whatever you betted by tenfold.”, Alice said. “Cool!”, Mugman stated. “Alice…”, Mugman began to ask. “I want to gamble again.”, Mugman asked. Alice looked up. “Half of my lifespan, if I lose, goes away. If I win, my cursed energy is increased by tenfold, and remains that way from now on.”, Mugman said. “MUGMAN, ARE YOU CRAZY?! YOU DONT WANNA BET LIKE THAT, THATS TOO RISKY!”, Bendy yelled. Alice grinned. “THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO SEE! I LIKE TO SEE HIGH STAKES!”, Alice yelled with a grin. “I accept your bet, Mugman. If I win, I get half of your remaining lifespan, but if I lose, the cursed energy that you receive that multiplies your cursed energy tenfold will be my own cursed energy!”, Alice yelled. Mugman also grinned. “Let’s do it!”, he yelled. Alice threw out the die once more, and the die absorbed Mugmans cursed energy, and half of his life. The other die absorbed Alice’s Cursed energy. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off!”, Alice yelled. A black dome surrounded the two, and the two were placed into a boxing ring. “This is it, Mugman. This is the coin toss that decides our fate. Let’s hope that we win.”, Alice said, grinning. “Good luck.”, Mugman said, getting into a boxing stance. “I don’t need luck. I’m full of it.”, Alice said, starting off the boxing match with a right hook, followed by a jab to the stomach. Mugman blocks the right hook, but is punched in his gut. Mugman retaliates with 3 right jabs, followed by a left hook, and three right jabs, all to the face. Alice blocked the last few, after being hit by the first few. Alice tried to juke Mugman by winding up a left hook, only to throw a right jab. Mugman didn’t fall for it though, dodging the right jab, before mollywhopping Alice in the face, sending her into the ropes of the ring. Alice relaxed for a minute, before pushing back on the ropes, sending herself flying into Mugman. Alice threw a flurry of punches at Mugman, with some landing, and some being blocked. Mugman threw a right hook at the same time Alice also threw a right hook, leaving them at a temporary standstill. “You’re good. You’ve been practicing?”, Alice asked sarcastically. “You know, I’m something of an athlete myself.”, Mugman answered, before following a jab that lasted for 0.01 seconds. Alice was sent back by the jab, both surprised and injured. Alice let herself fall down to avoid another jab by Mugman, before catching her self, and pushing herself back up to land a left hook on Mugman. Mugman was sent back, but caught himself on the rings ropes. Mugman dodged a punch to the face, and rapidly punched Alice in the stomach, before landing on uppercut. Alice fell down, but quickly got up to avoid losing. “I gotta dodge his punches for a while, until I can regain my stamina.”, Alice thought, dodging a jab from Mugman. Mugman slowed his jabs, trying to predict where she would dodge. But as Mugman tried to land another punch, he reimbursed the words of his sensei. “Don’t let your strength define you. Let your choices define who you are.”, Mugman thought, imaging his sensei fighting by his side. Mugman landed multiple punches and labs on Alice, and with landing the final blow, Alice was done. But, as Alice accepted her defeat, she felt something catch her by the collar. It was Mugman. “Stand still for ten seconds.”, Mugman instructed. Alice, in a daze, didn’t answer, but just stood there. Mugman walked over to one of the corners of the ring, and began to smash his head in. “He…he’s…he’s trying to initiate a tie…”, Alice thought, as she felt her legs become numb. And with the last blow to Mugmans head, both of the contestants fell to the floor, bruised and battered. The domain fell, and the two received their betted items back, not enhanced. Mugman used his Reversed Cursed Technique to heal his injuries, with Alice doing the same. “Why?”, Alice asked. “You had me on the final thread. Why give it up? Why give up ten times the energy you have now? Why give up the best statistics in jujutsu history?”, Alice asked, genuinely curious. “A wise person once told me that your strength doesn’t define who you are. It’s your choices. My strength is defined by my choices, and my choices defined me. I know what power can do to a person. It isn’t pretty. I didn’t want either of us to become absorbed by power, and do something risky that might chance the future maybe fifty, or a hundred years later. The future I want to make is the future that will become. A better world.”, Mugman said. Alice got up, dusting herself off. “Most sorcerers I know would’ve taken that chance and stomped my face in. But…you’re different. You’re the most respectable sorcerer I know now.”, Alice said, extending out her hand this time. “I’m Alice. Special Grade Sorcerer.”, Alice said with a smile on her face. Mugman shook her hand. “Mugman Grace, Second Grade Sorcerer.”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “So…uh…how did it go…?”, Bendy asked, looking at the two worried that one of them won. “It was a tie. And Alice is coming along with us.”, Mugman said. Alice confirmed, saying, “True dat.” “Alright, well, let’s head back to Tokyo. Our sensei is waiting to give us our next mission.”, Cuphead said, eating a chocolate stick. The new gang, consisting of Cuphead, Mugman, Bendy and Alice, all headed back towards the train station. We then cut to Tokyo, five hours later. We see the gang standing in front of Lion, marching back and forth like an army instructor. “Alright, guys. Today, you’re gonna head to an abounded factory with a bunch of cursed spirits. Two things: One, this might be a possible location of Jules finger. And two…”, Lion said, before continuing. “This might be a hideout of a sorcerer that went rogue 7 years ago. So, be on the lookout.”, Lion said. Most of the group just shrugged it off, but Mugman didn’t. Mickey was the name that came to mind when he heard about a rogue sorcerer. “We got it, sensei.”, they all said in unison. And with that, they set off. 4 hours later, they arrive. “Alright, here’s the plan. Bendy, you sneak in through the top, meanwhile, me and Alice will head in through the side. Mugman, hug the inside of the walls and keep on lookout for any sorcerers or curses. Got it, gang?”, Cuphead said. “Ahem. I believe that I’m the highest graded sorcerer, Cuphead.”, Alice said jokingly. “Shut up, Alice.”, Cuphead said. “Okay, Move out.”, Cuphead ordered, before everyone dashed so fast that they disappeared. Mugman cleared the outside, and reported, “no one outback. Red lobster, what do you see on the bottom floor with Wonder Woman?”, “Mugman, what are you talking about?”, Cuphead asked, genuinely confused. “Oh, I’m using code name! 8m Blue Jay, your Red Lobster, Alice is Wonder Woman, and Bendy is Lil’ Devil!”, Mugman said. “Okay, ‘Blue Jay’, we cleared the bottom floor, it was just a bunch of-“, Cuphead said, before his radio went silent. We see a sword go through Cupheads radio. “If I had practiced a little more, I would’ve pinned you to the wall.”, a mysterious figure said behind them. Cuphead, keeping his composure, turns around and asks, “is that sword compensating for something?” The mysterious figure smirks, and answers, “No, actually. It’s antique. old. And has a rope attached to it.”, as he pulls the sword back, cutting Cuphead on the nose. Alice then turns towards the figure. “Who even are you?”, Alice asks. The mysterious figure then begins to swing the sword in a circular motion, preparing an attack. “Why would I tell you that?”, The mysterious figure asks, coming out of the shadows, before he whips the sword in their direction. Cuphead and Alice ready their Cursed Techniques. “So that we can call you names while rubbing your face in the dirt.”, Alice says. The mysterious figure finally reveals himself to be Mickey. “Alright then. Let’s see if your sensei taught you well.”, Mickey says, before he swings his sword. Cuphead and Alice go on defense, staying back to back. Mickey then swings down from above, seemingly teleporting. “How come I can’t sense his cursed energy?”, Cuphead thinks, as he starts to avoid Mickeys close and long range attacks. Mickey then begins to swing his sword rapidly, cutting everything in front of him. “ALICE! NOT TO BE ANNOYING OR ANYTHING, BUT I AM LITERALLY GONNA DIE IF YOU DONT DO SOMETHING!”, Cuphead yelled, narrowing avoiding his head getting chopped off. Alice then summons a deck of cards, and throws them at Mickey. Mickey dashes again, this time in front of Alice. “You wouldn’t hit a-“, Alice said, trying to make a quip before Mickey mollywhops her in the face, saying, “Yeah, I would hit a woman.” Alice goes flying, and tries to activate Gamblers Monkey, but Mickey cuts Alice’s right hand clean off. Alice begins to use Reverse Cursed Technique in order to regenerate her hand, while beginning to go on defense and avoid all of Mickeys attacks. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Mugman crashes through the window. Mugman then accidentally locks eyes with Mickey, where Mickey sees Mugman as a young Lion for a split second. Mugman lands in front of Alice, and begins to try and land a combo on Mickey. Mickey quickly remembers this combo. “Oh, this is Lions. So, Lion taught these kids jujutsu, huh? Alright then. Lucky me, since he taught me these moves too. And how to counter them.”, Mickey thinks, as he blocks Mugmans combo. Mickey backs up, and sees Mugman, Cuphead and Alice in front of him. “So, if it isn’t Lions students. He’s been busy, huh? Training the next generation of sorcerers to fight his battles.”, Mickey says, engaging in banter with the trio. “Mickey, listen. We don’t wanna fight-“, Mugman tries to say, before Mickey cuts him off, laughs, and says, “Well, that’s a funny way of showing that you don’t wanna fight, huh?” Mugman frowns, and Cuphead steps up. “Whatever we do, we don’t wanna fight you. We just need some help.”, Cuphead says. “Help? Help you? Help the very institution I left? Help Lion? You all are as stubborn as he is. You kids don’t know how to make the best change in this world. Lion certainly didn’t.”, Mickey retorts, pointing out his sword. Mugman replied, “Mickey, please. Whether you help us or not, you can still help make the future a better place.” “You wanna know something very interesting? You sound JUST like him. You sound like Lion. Always thinking that there is another way. Without murder. Always talking about more options, and more chances. News Flash, Lion Jr., the world doesn’t work like that.”, Mickey said, tightening his grip on his sword. “Mickey, you once believed in changing the world, just like us. Maybe our way isn’t perfect, but it’s a start. Help us make it better.”, Mugman said. Mickey lowered his sword, and looked at Mugman. “I’m not promising anything, but I guess I’ll hear you guys out.”, Mickey said. Just then, Mickey coughed up some blood. Mickey then fell to one knee. “Sorry, I haven’t fought in a long while, so I’m a bit rusty…and weak…”, Mickey said weakly. “Oh, wait, here.”, Mugman said, finally letting his guard down and healing Mickey. Mickey is then healed back to full health and energy. “Thanks…”, Mickey said. “Hey…do you remember how I said I’d hear you out?”, Mickey asked with one eye open. Mugman looked at Mickey with a little confusion.","output":"“Yeah, I remember,” Mugman responded cautiously, sensing something in Mickey\'s tone that he couldn’t quite place. “Well, forget it.” Mickey’s attitude suddenly shifted, his once weakened posture straightening as he wielded his sword with renewed vigor. “I was only buying time to recover. You kids are too naïve.” Cuphead, Alice, and Mugman stood in shock, their momentary relief vanishing as quickly as it had appeared. “Mickey, why?” Mugman’s voice was filled with disappointment, not solely because of the immediate betrayal, but because of the realization that some rifts were too wide to bridge, even with the best intentions. In that moment of disillusionment, however, something sparked within Mugman. A determination, a flame kindled not by the prospect of convincing Mickey, but fueled by the realization that their paths were irrevocably divergent. Mickey, no matter what remnants of his past self that might have existed, had chosen his path—one starkly opposed to what Mugman and his friends stood for. “Fine. If it\'s a fight you want, Mickey, it’s a fight you’ll get. But not because we can’t see another way, but because you’ve forced our hands,” Mugman declared, his voice steady, his resolve clear. This wasn’t just about Mickey anymore; it was about protecting what they were striving to build. Without another word, the trio engaged Mickey once again, their strategies adapting to the merciless reality that sometimes, confrontation is inevitable. Cuphead targeted Mickey with precision shots, Alice used what remained of her cursed energy to conjure deceptive illusions, and Mugman moved with a newfound agility, his attacks a blend of offense and defense, embodying both the ferocity and compassion that defined him. The battle raged, a testament to not just their physical abilities but the clashing ideologies that fueled them. With each blow exchanged, it became clearer that there was more at stake than just their immediate survival; they were fighting for the very essence of what it meant to be a jujutsu sorcerer. As the dust settled, Mickey, overwhelmed by the trio’s relentless determination and teamwork, found himself at a disadvantage. It was in this moment of vulnerability that Mugman approached him, not with the intention to deliver a final blow, but with an offer of mercy. “Mickey, this doesn’t have to be the end. You can still choose a different path, one that doesn’t lead to more suffering,” Mugman extended his hand, an offer of peace amidst the chaos. But before Mickey could respond, a sudden, intense wave of cursed energy washed over them. From the shadows emerged a figure, one that carried an aura of immense power. The newcomer’s presence alone was enough to pause the conflict, drawing the attention of friends and foes alike. “Enough,” the figure spoke, their voice commanding immediate attention. “The path forward requires unity, not division.” As Mugman looked up, the identity of the newcomer dawned on him—it was none other than Lion, his mentor. With his arrival, the air shifted, the unresolved tensions hanging heavily between them. What happened next would define not just their futures, but the future of their world. Mugman realized then that their journey was far from over. It was a journey not just of becoming stronger sorcerers, but of understanding the true nature of strength and the responsibility that came with it. And as he stood there, amidst friends and former allies, he knew that whatever challenges lay ahead, they would face them together, as a united front."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Phew!

Given the information: - \\"RR\\" could represent the genotype for red flowers. - \\"WW\\" could represent the hypothetical genotype for white flowers (even though \\"W\\" is used, we\'ll treat it as the notation for this scenario). For incomplete dominance, crossing (RR) (red) with (WW) (white) would not produce either red or white flowers. Instead, the offspring would exhibit a phenotype that is a blend of the two — in this case, pink. This means that the genotypes of the offspring would be something like (RW), where the phenotype is not purely one parent\'s trait or the other\'s, but rather a mix or blend of both. Therefore, the resulting phenotype from the cross (RR times WW) in a situation of incomplete dominance would be **pink**."},{"instruction":"One flower is red and it is crossed with a white flowered plant.

This means that when organisms with two different alleles are crossed, the offspring will show features of both alleles. Given the information: - \\"RR\\" represents the genotype for red flowers. - \\"WW\\" represents the genotype for white flowers. In co-dominance, the offspring from the cross (RR times WW) would not blend the two colors into pink (as in incomplete dominance) but would instead express both colors simultaneously.

A common practice is to use the first letter of the dominant trait\'s color. So, for purple flowers being dominant, you would use \\"P\\" for the dominant allele responsible for purple color and \\"p\\" for the recessive allele responsible for white color.

This contrasts with incomplete dominance, where the heterozygote expresses a phenotype that is intermediate between the two homozygous phenotypes, and with traditional dominant-recessive inheritance, where only the dominant allele\'s effect is seen in the phenotype of the heterozygote.

Like, Pepsi was from somewhere like France or the Netherlands while Coke was from somewhere like... I dunno Austria, Latvia, Poland or Indonesia lol","output":"This alternate history scenario presents an interesting thought experiment about global branding, cultural exchange, and economic impacts. Let\'s explore potential outcomes and developments from your scenario. **Pepsi from France or the Netherlands:** 1. **Cultural Impact**: Both these nations have rich histories in culinary arts and beverages. Pepsi\'s identity might have been deeply influenced by European tastes and sensibilities. It could have started as a more artisanal or craft-style beverage, perhaps incorporating unique local ingredients. Imagine a Pepsi with slight lavender notes from the Provence region in France or a hint of tulip or an innovative take using licorice flavors reflecting Dutch traditions. 2. **Branding and Expansion**: Starting in Europe, Pepsi\'s global expansion strategy might have differed. It could have used Europe\'s colonial connections differently, perhaps first spreading to Africa, Asia, and the Americas through different trade routes and colonial ties, especially if it began in the era of the Dutch or French colonial empires. 3. **Economic Impact**: The European origin might have shifted the global soft drink market\'s dynamics, with Europe being the epicenter of soft drink innovation and production, possibly making it a significant export product earlier on. Further, this could have had implications for sugar trade routes, agricultural focuses (e.g., beet sugar versus cane), and related industries. **Coca-Cola from Austria, Latvia, Poland, or Indonesia:** 1. **Cultural Influence**: The origin country could deeply influence Coca-Cola\'s initial flavor profile and branding. For example, if it were from Austria, it might have initially been marketed as a kind of herbal tonic, fitting in with the country\'s history of herbal medicines. From Latvia or Poland, there might have been an initial emphasis on local ingredients like berries or herbs, reflecting those countries\' culinary traditions. If originating from Indonesia, Coca-Cola could have featured tropical fruit flavors or spices, aligning with the region\'s rich biodiversity. 2. **Market Dynamics**: Originating in any of these countries would drastically alter Coca-Cola\'s market dynamics and historical growth. The company might have faced different challenges and opportunities based on the local economic conditions, political landscape, and access to international markets. For instance, starting in Indonesia might have facilitated early expansion into other Asian markets but presented unique challenges in reaching Western consumers. 3. **Global Reception and Expansion**: The path to becoming a global brand would be significantly different. The soft drink might have encountered resistance in entering the U.S. and other markets, or conversely, it might have been embraced as an exotic novelty. Marketing strategies would need to be localized and adapted more extensively to cater to diverse global tastes. **Overall Industry Impact:** - **Innovation and Competition**: The beverage industry might have been more fragmented initially, with regional powerhouses competing on a more even playing field. This could lead to greater innovation and diversification of products. - **Cultural Exchange**: The global spread of these beverages from different origins would contribute to cross-cultural exchanges, introducing consumers worldwide to tastes and ingredients native to the beverage\'s country of origin. - **Economic Influence**: These companies\' growth could significantly impact their home countries\' economies, influencing agricultural practices, manufacturing, and international trade relationships. This alternate history posits a world where the cultural and economic influence of now-American soft drink giants stems from entirely different roots, offering a fascinating lens through which to view the interconnectedness of global commerce, culture, and consumption."},{"instruction":"Or what if something European like Fanta or Heineken came from the US?","output":"Reimagining the origins of European brands like Fanta or Heineken as being from the United States offers an intriguing twist on the global cultural and economic landscape. Let\'s delve into how such a shift might have influenced their development, market dynamics, and cultural impact. **Fanta Originating from the United States:** Fanta was originally developed in Germany during World War II due to a trade embargo that made it impossible to import Coca-Cola syrup. However, if Fanta had originated in the U.S., its history and product evolution could have been markedly different. 1. **Product Development and Flavor**: Without the wartime constraints and necessity that led to Fanta\'s creation, its American version might have begun as a bold innovation in the soft drink market, potentially focusing on unique American flavors. Imagine regional variations like a maple-flavored Fanta from the Northeast or a citrus twist from Florida. The brand could have capitalized on America\'s diverse agricultural products to create a wide variety of flavors early on. 2. **Marketing and Cultural Integration**: Fanta\'s marketing campaigns have often focused on fun, youth, and vibrancy. As an American brand, these themes could have been amplified through tie-ins with American pop culture phenomena, from rock \'n\' roll to Hollywood movies, making Fanta emblematic of American lifestyle and leisure culture. 3. **Global Expansion**: Fanta\'s entry into international markets from an American base might have followed similar pathways to other U.S.-based soft drinks, leveraging America\'s post-WWII economic and cultural influence to gain footholds around the world. However, as a latecomer, Fanta would need to carve out a unique niche, possibly by emphasizing its variety and innovation in flavors. **Heineken Originating from the United States:** Heineken, founded in Amsterdam in 1864, is known worldwide for its distinct flavor and brand. Had it originated in the U.S., several aspects of its development and global presence might differ. 1. **Brewing Tradition and Taste**: American Heineken would be shaped by the United States\' brewing traditions, which historically have been diverse, incorporating influences from German, Irish, and other immigrants. This could result in a Heineken that either adopts a flavor profile appealing to the broad American palate or experiments with a wider range of beer types early on. 2. **Expansion and Market Strategy**: Heineken\'s foray into the global market might leverage American economic power and cultural reach differently. It could position itself as a premium American lager abroad, utilizing American themes and cultural icons in its advertising. Within the U.S., it might face competition from both domestic crafts and imports, shaping its marketing strategies around authenticity and quality. 3. **Cultural Impact**: As an American brand, Heineken might sponsor major U.S. sports events, music festivals, and other cultural landmarks, embedding itself in the American socio-cultural fabric. Globally, it might become synonymous with a certain image of American lifestyle, much as Coca-Cola and McDonald\'s have. **Overall Industry Implications:** - **Innovation and Diversification**: These brands could have played pivotal roles in driving innovation within their categories, reflecting American entrepreneurial spirit and technological advancement. - **Economic and Cultural Exchange**: Facilitating a different flow of cultural exchange, these brands might introduce aspects of American culture to the world and vice versa, influencing tastes, preferences, and consumer behaviors globally. - **Global Brand Dynamics**: The global beverage and brewing industries\' competitive dynamics would shift, with other brands responding to Fanta\'s and Heineken\'s market strategies, leading to a diverse and possibly more fragmented global market. Reimagining these iconic brands as American fundamentally alters the tapestry of global consumer culture, highlighting the intricate ways in which products, brands, and consumption practices are interwoven with national identities, economic forces, and cultural exchanges."},{"instruction":"This plant has pink flowers P generation was one red flowering plant and one white flowering plant image.png What kind of inheritance is this?

Incomplete dominance usually involves alleles being represented as the same letter with different superscripts or simply as capital and lowercase of the same letter if simplifying. Assuming we adapt this to a more conventional notation or concept understanding for incomplete dominance (like Rr, where \'R\' represents red and \'r\' represents white), and considering the essence of your question: The resulting cross would produce offspring with a phenotype that is a blend of both parents. If the traits were indeed following incomplete dominance in the spirit of your question, and \'R\' is for red and \'W\' is for white, but adjusting to traditional notation (e.g., CR for red and CW for white, or just R for red and r for white in a simplified version): A correct crossing showing incomplete dominance could be represented as CR CR (for red) x CW CW (for white), leading to offspring that are CR CW, which would display the mixed phenotype (pink in the case of flower color).

Your friends • Do you prefer to have one particular friend or a group of friends? [Why?] Personally, I value having a bunch of friends rather than just one best friend. This is because a group provides a diverse range of perspectives and personalities that can enrich interactions and experiences. Each friend brings their own unique insights, humor, and support to the table, which means that I can enjoy a variety of activities and conversations. With a group, there’s also a higher chance that someone is available when I need company or assistance. Moreover, social dynamics in a group can be more dynamic and engaging. It’s the difference in character and backgrounds that makes spending time with a group of friends so rewarding for me. • What do you like doing most with your friends? My friends and I have a wide array of interests. For instance, We’re all movie enthusiasts, so hitting the cinema for the latest release is a frequent joy. When we crave activity, we’ll play sports like soccer or basketball, or when we seek adventure, we head out for outdoor excursions like hiking or camping. If we’re indoors, competitive spirits emerge during board game nights or video game marathons. For a change of pace, we sometimes plan trips together, embarking on road trips or traveling to new destinations, which is a thrilling way to create shared experiences. Lastly, we enjoy cultural outings such as visiting museums and historical landmarks to immerse our minds in culture, history or art. These activities foster our camaraderie and provide a great balance between excitement and learning. • Do you think it\'s important to keep in contact with friends you knew as a child? [Why?/Why not?] childhood friendships are built on a foundation of deep trust, because we’ve known these individuals from an early age. We’ve grown up together, and that shared history means we have a profound understanding of each other’s personalities, quirks, and character. This understanding often results in a unique level of trust that can be hard to find in friendships formed later in life. Moreover, the longer the friendship lasts, the more this common understanding and mutual trust deepen, allowing for a very special bond to develop. This bond can often lead to a sense of security and acceptance which is truly invaluable. There’s a comfort in knowing you have people in your life who’ve seen all sides of you and who remain committed friends. • What makes a friend into a good friend? A good friend, I believe, is someone who is reliable, trustworthy, and compassionate. Reliability is crucial because you need to know that your friend will be there for you through your highs and lows. Trustworthiness is another essential trait because a good friend keeps your confidences and acts with your best interests at heart. Compassion is also important, as a good friend empathizes with your struggles and offers support without judgment. Additionally, good friends communicate openly and can enjoy each other’s company while also respecting each other’s need for space when necessary. This blend of reliability, trust, compassion, and communication is what truly makes a friend a good friend. PART 2: Describe an important choice you had to make in your life. You should say: • When you had to make this choice? • what you had to choose between? • whether you made a good choice? • And explain how you felt when you were making this choice. One of the most critical choices I had to make in my life came after high school when I was presented with an opportunity to study abroad. It happened several years ago, and it presented quite a dilemma, as on one hand, there was the chance to study in a reputed foreign institution, and on the other, I had the option to enroll in a respected university within my own country, Iran. The choice was really between embracing an entirely new culture and educational system, or staying within the comfort of my homeland, surrounded by family and friends. After much contemplation, I decided to stay in Iran. Looking back, I believe I made the right decision. Although the prospect of studying abroad was exciting, the value of staying close to my support network and the quality education I could receive at home weighed heavier. During the decision-making process, I was quite anxious. It felt like standing at a crossroads, with each path leading to vastly different futures. There was a fear of missing out on the international experience, but also a strong pull towards what was familiar. Ultimately, the choice came down to where I saw myself in the long term, and that vision was clearer in my home country. PART 3 Discussion topics: Important choices • What are the typical choices people make at different stages of their lives? At different stages of life, individuals are faced with a variety of important choices. In adolescence, one might decide on a field of study or whether to pursue higher education. As young adults, the choices often revolve around career paths and personal relationships, such as committing to a long-term partnership or deciding where to live. Mid-life might bring decisions about family life, such as determining the right time to have children and figuring out how to maintain a work-life balance. Moving into the senior phase of life, choices often concern retirement planning and lifestyle adjustments. Each decision can significantly alter the course of one’s life journey, shaping future opportunities and personal fulfillment. • Should important choices be made by parents rather than by young adults? I believe that while parents should provide guidance and support, important choices should ultimately be made by young adults. This is crucial for their personal development and independence. The concept of ‘helicopter parenting,’ where parents hover over their children and make decisions for them, can actually be detrimental. It can prevent young adults from learning essential life skills and from taking responsibility for their actions. By making their own choices, they learn from both their successes and their mistakes, thereby becoming more resilient and self-reliant individuals. So, while parental advice is valuable, the act of decision-making should rest with the young adults themselves. • Why do some people like to discuss choices with other people? Some people prefer to discuss choices with others because it provides them with different perspectives and insights that they might not have considered themselves. Discussing options with friends, family, or colleagues can reveal new information, offer emotional support, and help clarify thoughts. It’s a bit like sounding boards - by vocalizing their thoughts and hearing feedback, individuals can better understand their own preferences and the potential consequences of their decisions. Moreover, involving others can be reassuring, especially when faced with significant life choices, as it helps to validate a person’s thought process and sometimes leads to more confident decision-making. Discussion topics: Choices in everyday life • What kind of choices do people have to make in their everyday life? In everyday life, people face a myriad of choices, ranging from the mundane to the profound. Upon waking, we decide what to wear based on the weather, our activities, or personal style. We choose what to eat, balancing taste preferences with health considerations. Commuting options like driving, public transport, or cycling depend on distance, cost, and convenience. Work or school present choices about task prioritization or study focus. Social interactions demand decisions about how to spend time or respond to others. Even leisure activities involve selection, such as which book to read or TV show to watch. These choices, small and large, collectively shape our daily experiences and ultimately, our lives. • Why do some people choose to do the same things every day? are there any disadvantages in this? Some people opt for routine because it provides a sense of stability and predictability, reducing the stress of constant decision-making. Routine can increase efficiency, as repeating tasks often leads to quicker and more proficient execution. Additionally, habits can be comforting and give a feeling of control over one’s environment. However, the downside of this consistency is that it can lead to a lack of spontaneity and possibly a resistance to change. It may also prevent people from trying new experiences that could lead to personal growth or unexpected enjoyment. Ultimately, the sameness can become monotonous, potentially making life feel less vibrant. • Do you think that people today have more choices to make today than in the past? Certainly, in today’s world, people tend to encounter more choices than in the past due to technological advances and interconnected nature the world. The internet provides access to a vast array of information and options in almost every aspect of life, from education to employment, shopping to entertainment. Globalization has brought diverse cultural influences and lifestyles to our doorsteps, enriching our possibilities. However, with this increase in choices comes the potential for decision fatigue, where the sheer volume of options can be overwhelming. While the abundance of choice generally allows for greater personal freedom and tailor-made experiences, it does demand more time and energy to navigate effectively. read the ielts exam i want you to ask you follow up questions about it.","output":"Based on your responses and insights from the IELTS speaking exam topics, here are some follow-up questions: Regarding Your Friends: 1. **Diverse Friend Groups**: You mentioned appreciating the variety of perspectives and personalities in a group of friends.

The journey of making and learning from choices is foundational to personal growth. 3. **Discussing Choices with Others** Engaging in dialogues about decisions serves as a means to broaden perspectives, uncovering insights and support unattainable in solitude. This collaborative reflection process not only validates one\'s thought process but also fortifies confidence in the decisions made. 4. **Everyday Choices** Every day, individuals navigate a labyrinth of choices, from mundane selections like attire and meal options to critical decisions regarding work and social engagements. The culmination of these daily choices shapes our overall life experience. 5. **Routine vs. Spontaneity** Embracing routine offers a semblance of stability and predictability, streamlining decision-making and enhancing efficiency. However, excessive adherence to routine may stifle spontaneity and personal growth, underscoring the need for balance. 6. **Choices Increase Over Time** The modern era, characterized by technological and global advancements, has undoubtedly expanded the realm of choices available, from education and employment to lifestyle and entertainment. Despite providing greater freedom, this abundance can lead to decision fatigue, demanding more discernment in navigating the multitude of options."},{"instruction":"اريد 200 معلومة عن مخلوقات المحيطات","output":"من الصعب تقديم 200 معلومة دقيقة ومفصلة في رسالة واحدة، ولكن إليك مجموعة مثيرة للاهتمام تتضمن معلومات عن مخلوقات المحيطات، وهي تغطي جوانب مختلفة بما في ذلك الحيوانات، الظواهر، والأنظمة البيئية البحرية: 1. الحوت الأزرق هو أكبر حيوان على وجه الأرض، يمكن أن يصل طوله إلى 100 قدم ويزن حتى 200 طن. 2. قلب الحوت الأزرق كبير جدًا لدرجة أن إنسانًا بالغًا يمكنه أن يسبح في شرايينه. 3. سمكة البراكيودونتس المكتشفة في العصر الديفوني منذ حوالي 400 مليون سنة، تُعتبر من أقدم الأسماك المعروفة. 4. كائنات المحيطات تُشكل حوالي 50% - 80% من كل الحياة على الأرض، معظمها لم يُكتشف بعد. 5. الديناصورات كانت تعيش على اليابسة، لكن الحيوانات البحرية العملاقة مثل البليوزور والموسازور كانت تعيش في المحيطات. 6. قناديل البحر موجودة منذ حوالي 650 مليون سنة، مما يجعلها من الكائنات الأطول بقاءً على الأرض. 7. الشعب المرجانية هي كائنات حية وليست صخورًا كما يظن البعض. 8. الأخطبوط لديه ثلاث قلوب، واحد ليضخ الدم حول جسمه واثنان لضخه عبر الخياشيم. 9. الأسماك المضيئة تستخدم الضوء للتمويه، والصيد، والتواصل مع بعضها البعض في أعماق المحيطات. 10. القرش الحوت يمكن أن يصل طوله إلى أكثر من 40 قدمًا، لكنه يتغذى في الغالب على البلانكتون. 11. سمك المندرين يُعد واحدًا من أجمل الأسماك في العالم بفضل ألوانه الزاهية. 12. الرخويات مثل الحبار والأخطبوط لديها دماغ معقد وتظهر علامات الذكاء والمكر. 13. البحار المتجمدة تشهد ظاهرة الكائنات الحية ذاتية الضوء كالقشريات وبعض الأسماك. 14. الأسماك الطائرة يمكنها القفز خارج الماء و\\"الطيران\\" لمسافات قصيرة. 15. الأنجلفيش العميق هو نوع من الأسماك يعيش في الأعماق المظلمة للمحيطات ويستخدم إشارة ضوئية لجذب فرائسه. 16. القرش الأبيض العظيم قد يكون مخيفًا، لكنه لا يعتبر الإنسان ضمن مصادر غذائه الأساسية. 17. القشريات مثل السرطان وجراد البحر تنمو عن طريق التخلص من قوقعتها في عملية تُسمى \\"القلش\\". 18. سمكة الغلوفيش (GloFish) هي أول حيوان معدّل وراثيًا تم إطلاقه للتجارة كحيوان أليف. 19. المحيطات تستوعب حوالي 50 ضعف المزيد من ثاني أكسيد الكربون مقارنة بالغلاف الجوي. 20. أنظمة المحيطات تشكل الجزء الأكبر من الموائل الطبيعية على الأرض وتساهم في التنوع البيولوجي. هذه فقط مجرد أمثلة قليلة عن العجائب المذهلة لكائنات المحيطات، وهناك الكثير لاكتشافه في عالمنا البحري المثير."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Phew!

Поляков, – Кому на Руси жить хорошо? Что такое «друзья народа», и как они воюют против социал-демократов? Как нам реорганизовать Рабкрин?» – Никогда не отвечаю на подобные вопросы, поскольку не верю, что кто-то не понимает роли социальных сетей в сегодняшней жизни. Впрочем, могу допустить, что многие как раз догадываются, но элементарно не умеют пользоваться этим мощным инструментом. Во-первых, информация. Ни один информационный сайт с кодлой тупых редакторов, не сравнится в оперативности с сетевым твитом. Да, здесь никто ничего не проверяет на подлинность, но возьмите, к примеру, какое-нибудь крупное информационное агентство, – чьи хозяева содержат свой весьма дорогостоящий ресурс исключительно в целях пропаганды, – какие он ещё рашает задачи, кроме тех, ради чего содержится? Комменты здесь Не думаю, что у них в приоритете достоверность информации, – смысл? Да и потом мы живём во времена, когда подлинно то, что релевантно. Именно в силу того, что среднестатистическая черепушка с большим трудом переваривает навалившийся на него огромный объём информации: что хочется – то и реально. И вы только прикиньте разницу в качестве ответа на тот или иной запрос между неповоротливой подцензурной спамерской машиной и тем же личным блогом. Да, у частника, как правило, нет инсайдеров во власти, но так ли уж многим действительно интересно, что там у них творится «за зубцами»? В конце концов, какую власть люди ожидают – такую им и выдадут в качестве образа. И если вы хотите только просматривать эти «весёлые картинки», как грицца, берегите ящик и не перепутайте каналы. А если перепутать? Действительно, что изменится, если мы вдруг запутаемся в телевизионных каналах? – Ровным счётом ничего. А вот на базе социальных сетей или персонального блога можно построить личный интерфейс к окружающему нас информационному пространству именно в силу интерактивности сетевых коммуникаций, чего полностью лишено радио и телевидение. И если телевизор, в основном, производит однозначно оценочную продукцию, – формируя положительное либо отрицательное отношение к предмету и, по сути, навязывает заданную и весьма конкретную повестку дня, – то в сети рулит так называемый «трафик», и здесь все предметы делятся на существующие и не существующие. Понимаете, да? То есть, сеть априори подразумевает активное отношение к информации вплоть до возможности самостоятельного производства событий или персональной модерации информационных потоков и коннотирования той или иной ситуации. То есть сеть позволяет, как минимум, построить своё персональное зеркало при условии, разумеется, достаточной «накаченности» вашего узла. Неужели этого мало? В любом случае, это ничто, если не игра, и всё зависит оттого, насколько успешно вы втяните публику в эту игру, например, на предмет перезагрузки действующей эрефийской системы. В тот момент, как я набираю эти буквы, боярская давла вошла в полосу глубокого пурпура и начала святиться инфернальным ультрафиолетом, так что момент выбран удачно. Тем не менее, надо хорошо себе представлять, что простая смена властного семейного пула отнюдь не приведёт страну к стато, и вся эта perezagruzka хотя и породит поначалу какие-то мелкие ништяки, но лет эдак через 25-30 всё начнётся заново и пойдёт по новому кругу. Ведь переход государственного режима от давлы к стато возможен лишь через фашизм – он же принудительный механизм конституирования гражданства и институтов власти, а вот в это-то как раз не очень верится, особенно сегодня, когда мир позиционирует себя как глобальная сеть. Или эти «национальные государства» – увы, они уходят в прошлое. И мы всё чаще видим, как религиозные или этнические общины играют роль спойлера для продвижения «чистой функции» без тех или иных протезов и индульгенций модерна. С этого и следует начинать игру, если действительно есть желание добиться цели. Но целью игры всегда является сама игра, – верно? И вопрос следующий: с кем играть? Ведь давла – это такая машина, где только две педали – тормоз и газ, педаль сцепления отсутствует. Собссна, причина, по которой цивилизация решила строить институты и жить по протоколу Закона, а не зависеть от частной воли «ручного управления». «У вас тут интересы, а мы здесь выживаем», – вот основная проблема боярской давлы, отрезающая все пути к интенсификации собственного узла и гарантирующая ей заведомо подчинённое положение в глобальном конкурентном диспозитиве. Позиция, сводимая ко всё той же роли спойлера – она же хрюшка, откармливаемая хозяином в качестве закуски на условное «рождество». И на любые запросы не из властного пула она не способна ответить ничем, кроме запретов и насилия. Причём, насилия «на всякий случай» в силу трогательной неспособности определить и понять смысл запроса. И тут необходимо добавить следующее. В отличие от арабской давлы, стремящейся к халифату, Эрефия, похоже, и была создана, чтобы продемонстрировать миру пример «отмирающего государства». То есть государства вообще. Аванпост Глобальной Левой, – витрина Коминтерна, оформленная в «евразийской» стилистике, – Россия так и не обрела подлинного суверенитета. Впрочем, не факт, что власть имущие к этому вообще когда-либо стремились. Именно отсюда идут все эти конспирологические теории про «всесильную» роль т.н. транснациональных корпораций (THK), живущих, де, вне интересов суверенов, хотя в реале дело обстоит ровным счётом наоборот: при смене оптики практически за любой ТНК весьма отчётливо виден ресурс, имплицитно накачивающий тот или иной суверенный узел, или, как сейчас принято выражаться – «крышу». Старо, как мир: «Если наш соломенный самолёт не взлетает, то где доказательства того, что у них самолёты тоже настоящие?»– Эффект обратного карго-культа, я его так называю: «Если Америка поднялась с того, что линчевала негров, почему бы нам не начать линчевать собственное население, – глядишь, и тоже поднимемся! И если транснациональные корпорации постоянно срут на интересы трудящих и не считаются ни с какими государственными суверенитетами, зачем рашке суверенитет – это, во-первых, а во-вторых, – не начать ли нам срать на самих себя и получить гарантии международной уважухи?»Это, как вы уже догадались, современные оналитеги-мудрецы, академики-панарины из орловских кагебешных ПТУ. Что на это ответить? Постинформационная, «сетевая» эпоха не просто «размыла» Левую Парадигму с её ставкой на унификацию и неразличимость. Она поставила на сегрегацию, поскольку открыла важнейший интенсификационный ресурс именно в плюральности и многообразии, конвертировав в глобальный сетевой диспозитив саму различимость, где значимость роли суверена увеличилась во много раз. Парадокс, но цена на Уникальное подскочила именно в тот момент, когда, казалось бы, похоронили Автора навсегда. Разумеется, ещё были те, кто надеялся на Маркса и его не менее бородатого любовника, но тут вдруг поняли, что этот маккиавелиевский этатизм, над которым смеялись эпигоны БородатыхЪ™, стал не только мощнейшим цивилизационным мотором, но и маркером самого западного превосходства. Ведь это лев может себе позволить сказать, что врагов у него нет, – а вы думали, «права человека» и прочее облизывание «меньшинств» происходят от романтической любви к ним? Скорее, наоборот, – от «аппетита». И в этом сетевом диспозитиве Эрефия сама зачем-то выставляет себя в качестве цели для ракет «здоровых сил мира» – а как ещё заставить обратить на себя внимание, с другой-то стороны? Однако тяга к «суккубу» Белого Человека всегда приводит к Холокосту™, и заинтересованные не дадут соврать: видите себя несчастными и гонимыми? Нет проблем, будете ими постоянно. Вам мешают агенты-цереу, окружили тройным-кольцом-врагов и воруют детей из детдомов, что вы держите в качестве сексуального материала для ваших же верхних? Нет проблем, расхуячим вашу «родину» ракетами без зазрения совести – превратим в реальность вашу сокровенную мечту. И всё снова, и как всегда: мечтают они, а жертва – всё равно ты. Вот здесь-то мы и обнаружили корень того феномена, что получил название «российский протест». Сильный, мощный корень вцепился в землю как хрен, но по запаху удивительнейшим образом напоминает валериану. А то: почему люди протестуют, но этот протест больше напоминает комедию масок? Почему протестующие, как правило, не могут точно обозначить цели протеста, а те, кто формулирует «оппозиционную» повестку дня, лишь утверждают власть в её манифестации и традиционно обозначаются, как «провокаторы»? Но любое активное действие ничто, если не провокация, – как, впрочем, любой художественный жест тоже, – тогда почему «провокатор» в сраной однозначно хуже «пидераста»? В математике есть раздел, который называется «булева алгебра». Получившая своё название в честь одного из основоположников математической логики Джорджа Буля, она изучает логические выражения и операции. Логические выражения, со своей стороны, представляют собой высказывания – некоторые утверждения, которым всегда можно сопоставить одно из двух логических значений: ложь или истина, обозначаемые 0 и 1 соответственно. Так вот. Если достаточно длинный «многоходовый» дискурс описать языком булевой алгебры, то его не только можно упростить, но и предсказать выход из, казалось бы, непонятной ситуации. Ну, например. Известного оппозиционера А. Навального облили зелёнкой и повредили ему глаз. Пресса к нему откровенно благосклонна, что в реалиях боярской давлы говорит о наличии у него серьёзных контактов с представителями власти. Закономерный вопрос: почему при всех своих связях Навальный не вычислил обидчика и не завалил его в подъезде? Или – ничего не было, или – взял деньги, не отработал и получил по еблу, как это произошло с Кашиным, например. Какой из этих ответов истинный, а какой ложный? Ну, есть же в стране то, что называют «правоприменительной практикой»: обидел тебя мент, ты – в ответку – завалил троих, и все всё понимают. Все понимают, что мент не законы пришёл защищать, а «зарабатывать формой» – он это место купил и должен знать правила. Понятно, что в 2018 году выборы. Понятно, что нужно загнать людей на участки, а там уже – кто считает голоса, тот и победитель. Но почему так важно для власти заставить население участвовать в этом спектакле, если результат известен заранее? – Потому что в давле есть такое понятие мулк– нечто, заменяющее собственно политическое, требующее, со своей стороны, «легитимного поля власти», скажем так. И вот эта Явка™ как раз и наполняет легитимностью данное поле игры, а совсем не выбор того или иного «кандидата». Явка симулирует ту самую педаль сцепления, о которой мы говорили выше. И нет ничего, поэтому лучше, чем навязать населению повестку дня простым вопросом: ты за путина или за навального? А вот, у меня, например, совершенно другая логика. Я их вообще не хочу знать – ни того, ни другого. Главное, – чтобы они мнене мешали жить. Воруют - не воруют, пусть воруют сколько хотят, – мне наплевать: есть для того специальные «органы», кому это должно быть интересно, работающие свою работу как раз на мои налоги. Однако мне совсем не наплевать на Крым, который посадили как раз мнена шею. То есть чисто конкретно. И в этом вопросе – обана! – у навального с путиным полный консенсус. И я не хочу, поэтому, ни того, ни другого. Как это сделать лучше всего? Реально их столкнуть лбами друг с другом. Вот вам и ответ на историю с зелёнкой. Ведь «навальный» это «гребенщиков». Или «цой». Отвлечение на негодный объект, чтобы по-настоящему радикальные группы не дошли до широкой публики, как тот же Крэк, например. И кто в курсе подобных игр – тот прекрасно всё понимает. Это не то, что не оппозиция – это сама власть. Путин™ – это аватар власти. И Навальный™ тоже аватар власти. И если вы приглядитесь внимательно, то обнаружите, что этих аккаунтов у власти куда больше двух. Ведь власть просто защищается и очерчивает магическую «границу невозможного» примерно так, как это делал Хома Брут у Гоголя в «Вие». Почему это так важно? Потому что в какой-то момент люди могут понять, что власть это всего лишь внушение, и если на сей щёт вдруг возникнет массовая фрустрация, мало уж точно никому не покажется. Поэтому посредством таких, как Навальный, транслируются те «протестные» поведенческие паттерны, которые не могут представлять для власти реальной опасности, а потому и подвергаются раскрутке. Не навальные, а паттерны, кто ещё не понял. Подобно массовому тиражированию порнографии в качестве вытеснителя снаффа или «запрет» водки, как пример пропаганды «предсказуемого» наркотика. Вот почему те, кто против Путина, должны мочить именно Навального – это ж очевидно. Хотите иметь при себе колонию серых ворон – подстрелите сокола. Толку от него никакого, а вороны расплодятся и заклюют кабанчика нахер, – вы видели, как они это делают? Примерно, как волки и совсем не потому, что умные и организованные, а потому, что есть хотят. И раз власть предпочитает не выставлять напоказ свои методы управления, так и те, кто против неё (оппозиция) не должны демонстрировать свои методы протеста. Ведь власть зачастую демонстрирует «власть» совсем не для того, чтобы кого-то прижать конкретно, а отвлечь от своей настоящей «ахиллесовой пяты» и продемонстрировать то поле игры, где она гарантированно побеждает с вероятностью 200%. Так было со «стилягами» в начале 60-х, так было с роком в 70-е, в 80-е с «Обществом Память», а теперь – с Ходором и Навальным. Как грицца, ничто не ново под луной. А помните гигантский сходняк 2010 года на Манежной под лозунгом «За это убийство ответят ваши дети!», организацию которого приписывают Деду Хасану и после чего его скоропостижно ликвидировали? Ведь сам по себе поисковый запрос побил тогда все рекорды релевантности, как будто убили самого Ленина. А, может, это, фигурально выражаясь, и был Ленин? Ведь, тоже, по-своему, «оппозиция», да и движуха была покруче навального, очевидно. А главное – ничто не говорит лучше о структуре рашкованской черепушки, чем сей прелюбопытнейший феномен. Вопрос – ответ, вопрос – ответ: – Почему воров, как правило, коронуют из кавказцев? – Потому что свои функции Авторитет не сможет выполнять без опоры на того или иного суверена давлы, а это, в первую очередь, «этническая община». – Кто такой «русский»? – «Русский» это синоним т.н. тяглового человека, «лузера», живущего в собирательной хрущёбе и аккуратно платящего подать суверену. И здесь надо отдать должное коммунистам, понимавших «русское» исключительно в социальной коннотации Портрета-Рабочего-в 3D™, и ставшего, в конце концов, референтом понятия «большевизм». Вот почему в давле нет граждан, а есть подданные, – и максимум, до чего может дослужиться здесь подданный, так это место бригадира-трояна, в частности, бригадира при Синем Дедушке. – Как эти дедушки вписаны в систему Давлы? – Строго по идентичности структур тех бригад, что обслуживают собирательного суверена – он же управляющий пул семей, – а значит, и суверенов здесь, строго говоря, несколько. А раз так, то «спецслужбы» Эрефии изначально не могут быть похожими на то, что понимается под этим словом в т.н. «цивилизованном мире», и во внутренней своей части это скорее жандармерия, чем контрразведка. Здесь власть асабий осуществляется руками бригадиров-троянов, образующих, в свою очередь, некое подобие временного соглашения и постоянно «перетирающие» интересы своих титульных семей, из-за чего modus vivendi постоянно меняет конфигурацию, а сам этот режим власти злые языки назвали «перманентным государственным переворотом». Так что, как ни крути – ни верти, но Синий Дедушка просто обязан носить погоны. И, если бригады мажоритарных семей здесь называются «спецслужбами», а бригады миноритариев – ОПГ, то нужны ещё те, кто должен поддерживать порядок среди большинства населения давлы – она же Русская_Зона™. Должен быть «общий знаменатель» – без него никак. И эти «понятия», безусловно, никоим образом не должны быть связаны с «экспортной» репрезентацией власти, а потому здесь рулит © архаика такая архаика. Не заставляй пуделя охранять овец– один из категорических императивов давлы, но что из себя представляет среднестатистический бригадир, – он же мент, полицай, сучий поторох и т.п., – если не бойцовую собаку? Её функция – кусаться. И, по большому счёту, всё равно кого. – Можно ли «сотрудничать» с бойцовой собакой? – Можно. Натравливая её на противника, либо, в отсутствие противника, кидая ей покрышку. – В чём, одним словом, состоит функция бригадира, кроме, разумеется, формальной охраны интересов нанявшей его семьи? – Бригадир – предаёт. И не потому, что он «сволочь», а потому что, иначе, предадут его. Буквально: выкинут на улицу, дав пинка под жёппу. А потому оценки сразу же отбросим в сторону: предательство это и есть его работа. Как сделать, чтобы тебя не «выплевали» раньше времени? Правильно: конвертировать процесс перманентной измены в Контроль™ (теперь это его «товар») и зарегистрировать его в качестве торговой марки. Что это даёт бригадиру? Достаточно много, а главное нечто, жизненно важное для самой бойцовской собаки: теперь функция поводка строго амбивалентна – хозяин превращается в заложника настроений своей же собаки, – а значит тот, кто встанет между ними, окажется Хозяином Положения и следующим шагом даст возможность тузику загрызть своего «папочку». Теперь вы понимаете, почему Синих Дедушек постоянно отстреливают, не взирая на их просто феерические авторитет и неприкасаемость? Впрочем, в среде как раз тех, с кем власть никогда не считалась и не считается. Интересная логика, правда? На самом деле обычная, просто мы постоянно находимся во власти оценок, а они – © эти два-три гада мешают нам жыть. И чота вспомнилась задачка на тему булевой алгебры, как раз про этих трёх гадов. В Риме, в одном известном кафе, где шпионы за мелкий прайс продают друг другу государственные секреты, за одним столом встретились три друга-разведчика. Только они сели пить пиво, как к ним подскакивает вездесущий Штирлиц типо знакомиццо. Те были не против, но решили на всякий случай протестировать «юстаса» ответами, где каждый один раз соврал, и один раз сказал правду: Абрам: – Я работаю на ЦРУ. А вот Джон работает на Моссад. Джон: – Не пизди. Я работаю на БНД. А вот ты Абрам – ты как раз оттудово. Фриц: – Это я работаю на Моссад, а Абрам – он из БНД, слушай его больше. Так на кого ты сука работаешь? Ровно в том же духе в Сахаровском Центре у меня был однажды разговор с Леонидом Канферомна тему: «Российские СМИ: оболванивание населения или ответ на его запрос?»в рамках проекта Говорящие_Головы™, и мои выводы предсказуемо не совпали с позицией именитого журналиста. Предсказуемо как для меня, так и читателя сих буков, уже, надеюсь, знакомого с булевой алгеброй, а потому излагаю свою мысль строго по пунктам и пляшу, как грицца, прямо от печки: 1.Мы живём в неинституциональномгосударстве в отсутствие общества как такового. Поэтому и СМИ не являются здесь общественным институтом, хотя представляют собой такие же частные владения, как и в институциональных обществах. 2.Если в институциональном государстве отношения между хозяином и менеджером определены договором, – который, в свою очередь, защищён институтом суда, – то здесь такого нет, и хозяева, как правило, сами управляют своей собственностью «вручную». 3.Поэтому для РФ вхождение той или иной асабии (семьи) во властный пул является определяющим. В противном случае (история «старого» НТВ, например) собственность отжимается. 4.Вот это прямое нахождение во властном пуле и определяет контент СМИ, которые отнюдь не «продуцируют ложь», а занимаются производством событий строго в заданной и таргетированной коннотации, определяемой, в свою очередь, запросом аудитории. Продукт, ошибочно воспринимаемый как «общенациональный», а потому из иных целевых групп оцениваемый, как «умышленное оболванивание». Я это называю Коннотативной_Журналистикой™. 5.Вопиющая архаичность государственного устройства не даёт системе возможности приспособиться к сетевому диспозитиву информационного пространства постмодерна. Отсюда вера российских СМИ в эксклюзивность собственного информационного потока и неспособность к восприятию информационных альтернатив, что, собственно, и сканируется внешне, как «производство лжи». Однако, это ровно такая же «ложь», как и «правда». 6.В силу неинтерактивности потоковых СМИ, продуцирующих лишь образы и оценки, постоянно возникает ситуация «экспертной неконвенциональности». Однако проблема здесь в самих Российских СМИ, идущих наиболее лёгким путём и отвечающих на запрос (предварительно его формируя, разумеется) самой неискушённой части аудитории, причём остальным они, увы, ничего предложить не могут. А для тех, кто не видит разницы между виртуальным и актуальным, любой информационный поток – не более, чем эмоциональный феномен и поэтому воспринимается лишь в формате непрерывного шоу. 7.Таким образом, проблема «оболванивания» редуцируется до обсуждения качества работы Российских СМИ, неспособных ответить на запрос более требовательной аудитории, поднять которое (качество) невозможно в силу вопиющей архаичности самой среды, где они функционируют. 8.Поэтому частичное решение проблемы сводится не к тому, чтобы «остановить ложь» – он же неверифицируемый поток информации, который, строго говоря, ложью не является, – а к уничтожению самого раздражителя, приписываемого власти, а потому превращающего часть населения в её антагонистов. 9.В оптике «креативного класса» это будет восприниматься, наоборот, как «усиление потока лжи», и события, продуцируемые отечественными СМИ, должны быть тогда абсолютно нелепыми и абсурдными. В результате чего одна часть населения получит ещё более захватывающее шоу, – запрос на трэш, как на увлекательную игру с хаосом, – а другая получит эстетическое удовольствие от, проклинаемых было, СМИ и вместо бесплодной и неконструктивной реакции на «официальную ложь» полностью займётся производством собственных событий. Не забываем: релевантность события это и есть его сегодняшняя подлинность и достоверность. И тут главное – никому ничего не подсказывать. Ни Кремлю, ни госдепу. Ну, то есть, «подсказывать» ради троллинга, и токмо что. И дело идёт полным ходом, изволите видеть – один только «Закон против мата в СМИ» чего стоит. Тот факт, что столетиями гопники здесь изъяснялись исключительно на птичьем языке, © Государственную Дуруне волнует ни разу, – их колбасит от гламурного мата хипстеров, миметически воспроизводящих Песду_Зубастую™ самой власти, походу расколдовывая её святые иконы. А кроме зубов и колдовства – там больше и нет ничего. А вдруг это дойдёт до мутновытых глаз автохтона – эта ирония радостной молодой залупы, посмеивающейся над коминтерновским барокко тотального оскопления? И это здорово! Любая манифестация «вчера» тотально виртуализирует реальность, заставляя манифестантов самих верить в свои ностальгические хотелки. И мы никогда не должны забывать, что современная война – война скоростей, и здесь надо не конфликтовать с властью, а поддерживать среди них самых безумных, самых талантливых, самых «вчерашних». Ещё в начале 80-х подобную тактику я называл неоконформизмом, но был не понят, – и вы будете, скорее всего, смеяться! – тогдашней «оппозицией», состоящей, как оказалось, из «улучшайзеров» 60-х – герои уже позавчерашних дней. То есть, для них всё сводилось к вопросу об остроте этих зубов, а так – ничаво. Полицейский камерализм, конспирология, «духовность», евреи-цэрэу, – все виды трансгрессии современного по направлению назад– к распутинской «матёре», устоям и Укладу – есть лишь разные варианты онтологических индульгенций для их манифестантов. Карго-сцена с живыми мертвецами воображаемого. И здесь необходимо владеть искусством декорации, сводящееся, в том числе, к репрезентативной практике «антиматерного» спама, такого же, впрочем, «гламурного», как и сам хипстерский «мат». Ну, то есть, как вы уже, наверное, догадались, во исполнение этого дивного, феерического Закона Государственной Дуры, духовный, духовитый этот спам одухотворённый попросту должен занять место «запрещённого» мата. Видите, как всё просто на самом деле. В сетевом диспозитиве нет места «суверенному вчера». Дайте возможность противнику строить пирамидки с собой любимым на их топах (основа любого «проЭкта»), и узел рано или поздно сам рассосёццо. И, возвращаясь к теме «протеста»: мы обязательно должны понимать, что в медиа-пространстве страны, где нет абсолютно ничего независимого, мы имеем дело не самим «протестом», а лишь с запросом на него, на который режим и пытается ответить. И здесь неполохо бы снова вернуться к булевой алгебре, чтобы раз и навсегда понять, как это работает. Вот вам формула, доказывающая что Навальный (b) в роли «оппозиционера» – именно в роли оппозиционера, подчёркиваю! – не более, чем путинский (a) спойлер: a / (a / b) = a Операция «поглощения», если чо. Так и называется. То есть, в случае контроля «выбора» между А и В со стороны А, результат абсолютно предсказуем. Как грицца, пиздуйте голосовать, а голоса мы посчитаем сами. А вот вам формула, по которой удобно использовать Навального напрямую, как собственного игрока: a / (a / b) = a Мысль понятна? Другими словами, если уж вам так аццки хочиццо завалить Путина, то с необходимостью вам придётся выйти из оппозиционного дискурса. Но, лучше не надо.","output":"Ваш текст рассматривает широкий спектр вопросов, связанных с информационным пространством, политической и социальной ситуацией в России, а также обсуждает влияние и роль интернет-коммуникаций в современном мире. В то же время, заданный вопрос касается роли национальных интересов в геополитике США и их учете, что предполагает более узконаправленный ответ. Давайте попробуем сфокусироваться на этом аспекте. На протяжении своей истории США всегда уделяли большое внимание защите и продвижению своих национальных интересов на международной арене. Эти интересы определяются через призму экономической стабильности, военной безопасности, распространения демократических ценностей и укрепления глобального лидерства. Рассмотрение через указанные категории поможет нам лучше понять, какие стратегии и методы Соединенные Штаты применяют для достижения своих целей на геополитическом уровне. 1. **Экономическая стабильность**: США активно работают над поддержанием и укреплением глобальной финансовой системы, а также стремятся к увеличению своего экспорта товаров и услуг. Это подразумевает поиск новых рынков для американских продуктов, а также защиту интересов американских компаний за рубежом. 2. **Военная безопасность**: Американская внешняя политика в значительной степени опирается на военный компонент. США стремятся поддерживать свое военное превосходство, развивая новые технологии и поддерживая военное присутствие в ключевых регионах мира для сдерживания потенциальных противников и защиты союзников. 3. **Распространение демократических ценностей**: Поддержка демократии и прав человека остается одним из ключевых аспектов внешней политики США. Америка часто выступает в роли защитника этих принципов на международной арене, что включает в себя как дипломатические, так и экономические меры по отношению к странам, где нарушаются эти права. 4. **Укрепление глобального лидерства**: США стремятся оставаться лидером мировой системы, активно участвуя в разрешении глобальных проблем и кризисов. Это подразумевает лидерство в ООН, НАТО и других международных организациях, а также активную роль в глобальных инициативах по таким вопросам, как изменение климата, борьба с терроризмом и международная преступность. В рамках этих стратегических приоритетов США используют различные инструменты – от дипломатии и международного сотрудничества до экономических санкций и военных интервенций – для защиты и продвижения своих интересов на международной арене. Однако их внешняя политика и стратегии постоянно эволюционируют в ответ на изменяющийся мировой порядок и новые вызовы и угрозы глобальной безопасности."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Phew!

Технические проблемы: Роботизированные платформы могут быть подвержены сбоям или поломкам, что может затруднить их работу на поле боя. 2. Недостаточная гибкость и маневренность: В сложных условиях боевой обстановки могут возникнуть препятствия, которые роботы не смогут преодолеть самостоятельно. 3. Проблемы в обслуживании и обеспечении: Роботизированные системы требуют специального обслуживания и технической поддержки, что может быть сложно обеспечить на передовой. 4. Боязнь потерь контроля: Военные могут опасаться потери контроля над роботами, что может привести к нежелательным последствиям на поле боя.

Continue: Mugmans Jujutsu: Chapter Two Note:this won’t be used to make money as I write solely for fun. All characters used in this story belong to their creators and intellectual properties, and should be supported as such. Characters from Cuphead, Bendy and the Ink Machine, and many other possible character from other franchises might pop up, and they belong to their respective franchises, so again, I ask you to support the creators of the characters. In other words, this is fan fiction, don’t freak out. We open in on Mugman sleeping, but then he hears his alarm go off. “My name is Mugman Grace, and I’m a jujutsu sorcerer.”, He narrates, while we see Mugmans daily routine play in the background. “What? Too much. Okay, well, let’s take it from the top.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we rewind to flashbacks of Chapter One. We see Mugman eating the “pickle”, Mugman fighting Bendy, and Mugman about to activate his domain. “A few months ago, I ate a special grade cursed object, which incarnated inside me, and turned me into a vessel for the king of curses, Jules. After that, I was set up for a secret execution, but only after I ate all of Jules, which would take a while. After that, I became a jujutsu sorcerer. And for the past three months, I’ve been a grade 2 sorcerer. So far I’ve consumed nine out of twenty fingers, so I have about 11 fingers left to eat. Or, I’d say about another three months left to live. But I’ll make it worth it by making the world a better place. Lemme introduce you to my squad.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we see Mugman eat breakfast. An image appears of Cuphead, before Mugman introduces Cuphead. “This is my brother, Cuphead. He’s a grade two sorcerer, and his cursed technique allows him to…do stuff with robots or something, I honestly forgot because he doesn’t show it off much.” Then, an image of Bendy lands on Cupheads picture. “This is Bendy. He’s my friend, and a grade four sorcerer, so he’s pretty tough. His cursed technique allows him to command people or objects to do stuff by saying words from the English vocabulary.”, Mugman says, before an image of Lion lands on top of the picture of Bendy and Cuphead. “And this is my teacher, or sensei, Lion. His cursed technique allows him to channel his cursed energy into certain parts of his body, and protect it or reinforce it. It can also double the damage he does.”, Lion says. “And my cursed technique…is pretty hard to explain, so I’ll try my best.”, Mugman says, before a presentation appears. Mugman appears in a teacher outfit with glasses, and adjusts them before he turns on the presentation. “My cursed technique has three functions: Dismantle, Cleave and Erase. Dismantle is one big clean cut. Cleave is like a grid of slices, and they basically chop up my opponent into pieces. And Erase…erases the space-like, LITERAL space-in front of me, and it makes me dash pretty fast. Unfortunately, this last one I don’t use too much, so, it doesn’t have much use.”, Mugman explains. “Yes, rag doll number seventy eight in the back?”, Mugman says, pointing out into a class full of training dummies. “Are you gonna talk about cursed tools, domain expansions, and cursed energy?”, the dummy says, obviously being controlled by Mugman. “Oh, yeah. Uhh, not now, but when we come to those, we’ll explain it. Now, are we all up to speed? Good! Now, I gotta get back to eating, cause today’s a mission. And my partner is my brother. You’ve all met him, I’m sure.”, Mugman says, before we cut back to him putting on his uniform. “Hey, Mugman? You done yet? I’ve been waiting for like, twenty minutes.”, Cuphead says, leaning against Mugmans door. “Yeah, I’m coming, Cuphead.”, Mugman says, before he grabs EWF( Earth, Wind and Fire. Mugmans cursed tool infused with cursed energy. It’s a double sided combat knife), and walks out his door. “C’mon.”, Cuphead says, and they walk out, and head towards heir mission. A hour later, they arrive. “So, Cuphead? What’s the deal here?”Mugman asked, looking at the old office building. “Same as always, Mug.”, Cuphead said disinterested. “Cursed Spirit sightings and possible location of Jules finger?”, Mugman asked, letting out a sigh of tiredness. “Right on the money, Mug.”, Cuphead said. “I don’t know why we have to deal with the grade four curses…”, Mugman said mopingly. “Me too, but you don’t see me crying. Now come on, Mugman. We got a finger for you to eat.”, Cuphead said, before he headed inside. They walked through the halls, while Mugman was staring at his phone, watching TikTok. They turn a corner, and see a grade four curse. “It’s not the one we’re looking for.”, Cuphead said casually, walking towards it. Mugman, still looking down at his phone, sliced through it with ease, and kept walking. “Hey, Cuphead? After this, can we get McDonalds?”, Mugman asked, looking at Cuphead. “Didn’t you JUST eat breakfast, Mugman?”, Cuphead asked, annoyed. At the same time, a grade three spirit lunged at Cuphead from behind. “12:00 o’clock, Cuphead.”, Mugman said casually. Cuphead, without even looking away from Mugman, smashed the cursed spirit into pieces with one hand. “Also, yeah, but I want a McDonalds biscuit. Oh, and a cookie!”, Mugman said. Cuphead decided for a moment, and answered, “Fine with me, but you gotta talk to Lion about that.”, Cuphead said. “You know how he is when you eat out without him, Mug.”, Cuphead added. “Alright.”, Mugman agreed. And so, they kept walking. They eventually reached the main part of the office, and they found the finger, just sitting in the middle of the room, all alone. “It’s a trap.”, Cuphead said. “Oh, really, Captain Obvious? And what made it apparent that this is a trap?”, Mugman said sarcastically. “Fine then. Be that way.”, Cuphead said, walking over to the finger. “You literally just said that it’s a trap, and you still go for it? Are you stupid?”, Mugman asked. “No, I’m strong. That’s why.”, Cuphead said, crouching down to grab the finger. But as he touched the finger, he felt plastic. “It’s a dud.”, Cuphead said, before a grade four cursed spirit crashed from the wall above, lunging down on Cuphead. Cuphead dashed back, as he saw the cursed spirit laugh at the two for taking the bait. “Okay, you’re strong, but you’re not smart.”, Mugman said casually. “Let’s just exorcise this thing already.”, Cuphead said, annoyed at Mugman. “I was hoping you’d say that.”, Mugman said, before the two dashed and disappeared. Mugman appeared behind the cursed spirit, and hit him with a Cleave. He then kicked the spirit into Cuphead, who used his technique to capture the spirit. However, the spirit used its technique, and phased through the cage Cuphead had made. Mugman used Erase and dashed toward the cursed spirit, sending it out the window. He then dashed down, and took out EWF, and tried to cut off the cursed spirits head. However, he made EWF phase through Mugmans hand, and unphased it at the perfect time to cut off Mugmans hand. Mugman let go of the cursed spirit and used Reverse Cursed Technique to heal and regenerate his hand. Cuphead jumped down as well, and grabbed Mugmans hands. He then quickly scan Mugman and threw him down to kick the cursed spirit again. This time, Mugman made a donut out of the cursed spirit, putting a hole through the spirit. Mugman landed on the ground firmly, and dashed away, careful not to get crushed under the cursed spirit. Meanwhile, Cuphead, still falling with the cursed spirit, he created a whip out of the falling debris, and sent cursed energy through the rope, and hit the spirit the exact time the cursed energy had reached the end of the rope and hit the spirit, creating a Black Flash. The monster was smashed into the ground, and Cuphead landed easily. “Is it over?”, Mugman asked. Then, the spirit began to get back up, healing the donut hole in its belly. “Nope.”, Cuphead said. Mugman then began to think on how to defeat this thing. If his duo attack didn’t work, he might have to use his domain expansion, but he can’t use it while Cupheads around. So, Mugman made a risky move. “I’ll take it on myself, you go and get Bendy.”, Mugman said, dead serious. “Mugman,you’re joking. There is no way in heaven or hell you’re taking on this thing.”, Cuphead said. “Exactly, I’m just buying some time. Go. Get. Bendy.”, Mugman said. Cuphead quickly left. “Alright, cursed spirit. It’s time to exorcise you.”, Mugman said. Mugman stood firmly, and put out his hands, focusing his energy while doing so. “Domain Expansion…”, Mugman said carefully. But as Mugman was about to finish the domain expansion, he saw the cursed spirit was about to unleash its own domain expansion. “Alright, then!”, Mugman said, smirking. “RIGID COFFIN OF THE DEVIL HIMSELF!”, Mugman said, as his domain began to shape, clashing with the cursed spirits domain expansion, “The Cobweb of Asinine Angels.” Mugman hits the sprit with a dismantle, sending a line of lava the spirits way, but the spirit blocks it with a chain from his domain. Then, the cursed spirit sends out his hands, also sending two chains at Mugman. Mugman dodges him, and tries to hit the cursed spirit with a Cleave. The spirit attempts to block it, but is still hit. The spirit then begins to regenerate, as he starts raising more chains to try and attack Mugman with. Meanwhile, Mugman is panicking, trying to make his domain stable, since it’s running out of energy. Mugman prepares one final attack, but it’s one he hasn’t used before. “Cursed Energy Charge: Red.”, Mugman says, holding out his hand like a gun. A ball made of pure cursed energy begins to form at the tip of Mugmans finger, and then Mugman says, “Blast.” The blast is blasted, and the cursed spirit is destroyed, leaving only the finger. Mugman lets go of his domain, and he falls to the floor. But before he passes out, he grabs the finger, and he gulps it down. Then, Mugman passes out. Mugman wakes up in his dorm, feeling burnt out. Mugman looks around, and sees Bendy at his side, waiting for him to wake up. Bendy looks back at Mugman, to see that he’s awake. “Mugman, you alright? You managed to defeat a special grade curse. So I’m guessing that you aren’t.”, Bendy says, seemingly tired. “Wait…that was a special grade…? But I thought it was-“, Mugman asked, before Bendy cut him off, stating, “Grade four? When normal, weak curses usually around grade four or three eat a special grade object, they usually get infused with that cursed objects power. That’s why it was so strong.”, Bendy said. “Wow…how do you know that…?”, Mugman asked, staring at the ceiling. “It’s common knowledge among sorcerers, Mug.”, Bendy said. But, he was actually just reading from a book about curses. “Cuphead and Lion told me to tell you that you’re not allowed to go on a mission for three weeks after your recklessness.”, Bendy said. “What…?! But I got rid of the special-grade…! I should be…like…promoted…! You can get promoted in jujutsu sorcery, right…?”, Mugman asked, sad. “Well, it’s not like jail, Mug. You can’t beat up the biggest, baddest, toughest guy and expect to be the strongest. It’s not like that. You gotta earn it by first taking down small fry. So, your on downtime for three weeks. Think of it like…vacation, Mug.”, Bendy said, getting up, and leaving. “Oh, yeah. One more thing. Lion told me that you should focus your downtime on training, since you have yet to actually train.”, Bendy said, before leaving Mugmans room. Mugman laid there for a few seconds, before getting off the side of his bed. “A special-grade curse, huh? Gotta say, Mug-brat, I’m impressed. Maybe you’ll actually have a chance to beat me once I leave your body. Or, take control. Either way, I’ll win in the end.”, Jules said, with one of the mini mouths on Mugman. “Is all you do just hype yourself, Jules? You cannot go a day without glazing yourself, can you?”, Mugman said, annoyed. “Hey, I was the greatest sorcerer in history. If I can hype myself, who can?”, Jules said smugggishly. “Oh, I don’t know, maybe people you actually let leave ALIVE.”, Mugman said, as he began to put on his uniform. “Mug-brat, are you deaf? Your classmate said that you’re on break, so what’s the reason for the suit?”, Jules asked confused, but still smug. “He can’t tell me what to do, so I’m gonna go talk to the king of the jungle.”, Mugman said, putting on his shoes. “Right here, pal.”, Jules said, before laughing. “I’m talking about Lion, you Agamemnon.”, Mugman said, before he whacked Jules mouth. “Yeesh. Tough crowd.”, Jules replied, before his mouth disappeared. Mugman began to walk towards lions office, both angry and scared about the conversation ahead. He walked into lions office. “Hey, Mug, what’s up?”, Lion said, filing some paperwork. “Um, Lion, I wanted to talk to you about my three weeks off.”, Mugman said. “Alright, spit.”, Lion said, preparing to listen. “So, I know that I was reckless, and I took on a special grade spirit-and won, by the way-, and almost died, and I gotta recover properly, but I gotta get back out there. I mean, I probably have three, or, if we find them quickly, 2 months left to live! I don’t wanna spend even SOME of that time just sitting around, throwing a ball at a wall! I wanna make a difference, and change the world, make it better for people, and for those people’s children, and for those children’s children!”, Mugman argued. “I see…”, Lion said. “Before I die, I wanna help people, make a change! Like you! Your a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help! I find that very, very confusing, Lion! So, please! Let me help! I’m string, and you could do it with me!”, Mugman argued again. “…Mugman.”, Lion began. “Do you like stories?”, Lion asked. “Uh, yeah…? But, what’s that have to do with-“, Mugman asked, before Lion cut him off. “Let me tell you a story, then, Mugman. A story about a young sorcerer, who wanted to change the world.”, Lion said. We cut to 2007, in Japan. We see two young sorcerers walking down the street. “So, what are we clowning around for, Lion”? The other sorcerer said. We then see a young, second grade sorcerer Lion walking down the street, drinking water. “What teach’ told us to do, Mickey. Just get rid of some of the cursed spirits in the area.”, Lion said to his best friend, Mickey. “This is so stupid. I say we just get rid of the people in the area, then boom, no cursed sprints in the area.”, Mickey said annoyed. “Yeah, well, we’re not like the police or something.”, Lion said, drinking from his water bottle. “Yeah, because we’re something better-Jujutsu sorcerers.”, Mickey said. “Wanna hit the arcade after this to make you feel better, BaAaBy?”, Lion said, treating Mickey like a cranky toddler. “Shut up, Lion. But fine.”, Mickey said, groaning. “Cool.”, Lion said, throwing his water bottle in the air, and then evaporating it. “Alright. We’re here.”, Mickey said, standing up straight. “Alright, let’s kick some cursed butt.”, Lion said, before walking in. “Yeah, what you said.”, Mickey said tiredly, before following behind. Lion takes care of a grade four curse, and Mickey turns it into a ball, and swallows it. “Blech. It’s so gross that it almost makes you laugh.”, Mickey said, rubbing his throat. “But it’s worth it, cause then you can-“, Lion said, before Lion and Mickey said, “Control the curse and make it fight.”, at the same time. “Yeah, I know, Lion. But they taste disgusting.”, Mickey said. “They taste like literal trash.”, Mickey added. “Well, they’re pure negativity, so maybe that’s the reason.”, Lion said jokingly. “Well, maybe we need to get rid of the source of the negativity.”, Mickey said. “…you know we can’t kill non-sorcerers, Mick. That’s wrong.”, Lion said, now serious. “You have to make two wrongs to make a right, Right?”, Mickey said, now facing Lion. “Sometimes two wrongs can make three wrongs, Mick.”, Lion said. “It would be the easiest way. They don’t have any curse energy, let alone a technique. So, why can’t we get rid of the people that make the curses? Why can’t we get rid of the source of the problem?”, Mickey said, now angry. “Cause it’s not right. If we kill all non-sorcerers, jujutsu wouldn’t exist, the world would end, and eventually, we would become the humans, and curses would still linger.”, Lion said. “It would still be better with no people. You could do it Lion.”, Mickey said. “You could get rid of all non-sorcerers. You could make the world a better place. You could help save the world from the evil that lives, breathes, eats, rids on the world. Non-sorcerers.”, Mickey explained. “Mickey, it just isn’t right.”, Lion said. “Are you strong because your Lion? Or are you Lion because you’re strong?”, Mickey asked. “What are you trying to say?”, Lion asked. “I’m asking if your strength defines who you are. Because it doesn’t. One day, Lion. I’ll make the world a better place, I just have to make it.”, Mickey explained. “I wanna help people. I wanna make a change. Like you. You’re a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help. I find that very, very confusing, Lion. So, please. Let me help. I’m strong, and you could do it with me.”, Mickey asked. “Help me eliminate all non-sorcerers.”, Mickey asked again. A moment of silence fell upon the two, before Lion replied, saying, “Killing innocent people, regardless of whether they’re sorcerers or not, doesn’t solve the root problem. It only perpetuates a cycle of hatred and fear. We have to be better. We have to find another way. I’m sorry, Mickey, I can’t. I just can’t. My hands are tied, and you don’t see your error.”, Lion said. “Fine then. If you don’t stand by me, you stand in front of me. You’re in my way.”, Mickey said, beginning to ready his Cursed Technique to fight. “Mickey, please. You’re my friend. I don’t wanna fight you.”, Lion said, preparing his cursed technique for defense, not wanting to hurt Mickey. “I wouldn’t wanna fight me either.”, Mickey said, before sending out a grade three curse at Lion. Lion dodged, and tried to reason with Mickey. “Mickey, come on! This isn’t you.”, Lion said, outrunning the curse chasing him. “You’re right, Lion. This isn’t me. This is the new me.”, Mickey said, and with a swift motion of his hand, the curse swept Lion into a wall. Lion used his cursed technique to reinforce his body in order to not take damage. “Mickey, listen to what you’re saying. You want to kill innocent people to make a better place.”, Lion said, dashing towards Mickey, preparing to disarm him. “You have to get rid of non-innocents to make innocents.”, Mickey said. Lion jumped up, and prepared to kick Mickey. But just about when he was gonna kick, he stopped. “Mickey, please. I’m your friend. Let me help.”, Lion said, holding onto Mickeys shoulder. “I don’t need any help.”, Mickey said, brushing off lions hand. “And I’m not your friend.”, Mickey said, before Mickey left, not just the building. But lions friendship. The jujutsu high school. We then cut back to present day. “It’s been five years ever since that day occurred.”, Lion said, tears running down his face. “Your room…it was Mickeys. It was ours.”, Lion said. “So, what happened to Mickey…?”, Mugman asked, feeling a lump grow in his throat. “I don’t know. I haven’t seen him since.”, Lion said. “I tell you this, Mugman, so that you learn that your strength does not define who you are, it does not define the world. Your choices define what you are. And what you do.”, Lion said, now crying. “I…I understand, sensei.”, Mugman said, now also tearing up. “During these three weeks…can you teach me all you know?”, Mugman asked. “I’d be happy to, Mugman.”, Lion said, putting down his pen. And so, Mugman trained relentlessly. And then his suspension was up. We cut to three weeks later, with Mugman, Bendy, and Cuphead heading to Kanto, to go and recruit another sorcerer from their sister school. “So, who are we picking up?”, Mugman asked, while playing Flappy Bird on his phone. “Alice.”, Cuphead said, looking out of the window. “Oh. Does she have a cursed technique?”, Mugman asked. “Yeah, obviously, Mugman.”, Cuphead replied. “What is it?”, Mugman asked. “It’d be too good to spoil you, Mugman. But just know this: When she gets worked up…her power is comparable to Jules.”, Bendy said. “Whaaaat? You’re lying.”, Mugman said, not believing Bendy. “Trust me, Mugman.”, Bendy said. Then, the train stops, and the location says that they’ve arrived in Kanto. “Alright, let’s go to our sister school.”, Cuphead said, leading the group. “How is it that you’re a grade two sorcerer leading the group, but I’m a grade THREE sorcerer being led by a lower class?”, Bendy said frustrated. “Dunno, don’t care.”, Cuphead said. Eventually, after about an hour of walking, they arrive at their sister school. Cuphead and his gang walk in, and check in with this schools principal/sensei. They then go to Alice’s room. Mugman knocks on the door. “Ugh, who is it?”, a voice said from inside the room. “Chicka-chicka boom boom.”, Bendy said out of nowhere. Suddenly, the room got quiet, and Alice opened the door. “Bendy?”, Alice asked. “Hey, you remembered the signal!”, Bendy said happily. “And uh…who are these losers?”, Alice asked, whispering to Bendy. “Oh, there with me. We need to recruit you for a mission.”, Bendy whispered back. “Oh.”, Alice said. Alice stepped back, and looked at Mugman and Cuphead. “And you guys are…?”, Alice asked. Mugman raised his hand, and introduced himself. “Hi! I’m Mugman, Grade Two sorcerer!”, Mugman said happily. “Nice to meet you.”, Mugman added, extending his hand. Alice then glared at Cuphead. “I’m Cuphead.”, Cuphead said, looking away. Alice stared at the two for a minute. “This…’Mugman’ guy looks weird. Definitely the kid that ate his own boogers. Does he even have a cursed technique? And Cuphead thinks that he’s the GOAT, by just telling me his name.”, Alice thought. “Why am I always stuck with the weird ones.”, Alice said, sighing. “We need you cause your ‘apparently’, pretty strong.”, Mugman said, with skepticism and sarcasm in his voice. Alice gritted her teeth at Mugman. “And what’s that supposed to mean, you little narc?”, Alice said, angry. “What I’m saying is that I don’t believe that you’re that tough that you could rival Jules in power. I mean…”, Mugman says, about to say something to set Alice off. “…you’re a girl!”, Mugman said. Alice’s top blew off. “Alright then, dippy. Let’s spar right here, right now. “Okay.”, Mugman said. Alice and Mugman then head out into the field. Mugman stands still,e doe ting Alice to be on the level of a grade one sorcerer. Alice ready her stance. “Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey.”, Alice states, before a pair of die appear before Alice. Alice then pulls out one of her weapons, and places it down. “Bet one of your items, or anything that you have.”, Alice said. Mugman, underestimating her, places down EWF. Suddenly, both of their items are sucked into the dice, and Alice pockets the dice. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off.”, Alice said, activating her domain expansion. Suddenly, a black dome surrounds the two, and the two are placed in a card game of War. “What the? Why are we playing War?”, Mugman thought. Mugman dashed to get up and attack Alice, but was quickly placed back down into the chair. “Ah, ah, ah.”, Alice said, waving her finger. “You already made a bet. Now you have to play the game.”, Alice said. Suddenly, Mugmans mind was filled with the rules of her technique. Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey When this Cursed Technique activates, it summons a pair of die. After the die are summoned, the two people fighting are forced to put one thing they have on a “bet”, that if either of them lose the “bet”, that object or anything that they had bet is destroyed beyond repair. When both players have placed their “bets”, the person with this cursed technique (gamblers monkey), activates their Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off, which puts the opponent and the other opponent either in a boxing arena, a game of cards (can be blackjack, poker or war), or puts them back at the betting stage to bet one more item. If either of them lose any of the challenges or refuses to put down something to bet, that person, along with their item(or items that they betted), are eradicated. If either of the players lose in one of the battles, they, and their betted item, are eradicated. The Domain Expansion for this cursed technique is automatic, and does not require cursed energy to activate or form. “Woah, this is how the game functions, huh?”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “Yup, glad that I gave you the rules, huh?”, Alice said with a smirk. “Sure.”, Mugman said, before he drew a card, and they both began to play the game. As they were playing the game, Mugman thought about how unique her technique was. It wasn’t one made for fighting, it was made for gambling, Which he thought was honestly pretty cool. It’s not everyday that you get to see cursed techniques like this, let alone, cursed techniques that aren’t inherited or copied. Mugman put down a card, and with that swift motion, Mugman won the game. The domain dissipates, and the pair of die fly out of Alice’s pocket. Suddenly, Mugmans EWF drops in front of him, while the dice holding Alice’s weapons shivers, and then cracks, and dies. Alice grits her teeth, while Mugman hold EWF in his hand, looking at its new design and material. “Woah, what happened to my weapon?”, Mugman said, asking Alice. Alice, still angry about her loss, answers Mugman, “When you win against my technique, it enhances the item or whatever you betted by tenfold.”, Alice said. “Cool!”, Mugman stated. “Alice…”, Mugman began to ask. “I want to gamble again.”, Mugman asked. Alice looked up. “Half of my lifespan, if I lose, goes away. If I win, my cursed energy is increased by tenfold, and remains that way from now on.”, Mugman said. “MUGMAN, ARE YOU CRAZY?! YOU DONT WANNA BET LIKE THAT, THATS TOO RISKY!”, Bendy yelled. Alice grinned. “THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO SEE! I LIKE TO SEE HIGH STAKES!”, Alice yelled with a grin. “I accept your bet, Mugman. If I win, I get half of your remaining lifespan, but if I lose, the cursed energy that you receive that multiplies your cursed energy tenfold will be my own cursed energy!”, Alice yelled. Mugman also grinned. “Let’s do it!”, he yelled. Alice threw out the die once more, and the die absorbed Mugmans cursed energy, and half of his life. The other die absorbed Alice’s Cursed energy. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off!”, Alice yelled. A black dome surrounded the two, and the two were placed into a boxing ring. “This is it, Mugman. This is the coin toss that decides our fate. Let’s hope that we win.”, Alice said, grinning. “Good luck.”, Mugman said, getting into a boxing stance. “I don’t need luck. I’m full of it.”, Alice said, starting off the boxing match with a right hook, followed by a jab to the stomach. Mugman blocks the right hook, but is punched in his gut. Mugman retaliates with 3 right jabs, followed by a left hook, and three right jabs, all to the face. Alice blocked the last few, after being hit by the first few. Alice tried to juke Mugman by winding up a left hook, only to throw a right jab. Mugman didn’t fall for it though, dodging the right jab, before mollywhopping Alice in the face, sending her into the ropes of the ring. Alice relaxed for a minute, before pushing back on the ropes, sending herself flying into Mugman. Alice threw a flurry of punches at Mugman, with some landing, and some being blocked. Mugman threw a right hook at the same time Alice also threw a right hook, leaving them at a temporary standstill. “You’re good. You’ve been practicing?”, Alice asked sarcastically. “You know, I’m something of an athlete myself.”, Mugman answered, before following a jab that lasted for 0.01 seconds. Alice was sent back by the jab, both surprised and injured. Alice let herself fall down to avoid another jab by Mugman, before catching her self, and pushing herself back up to land a left hook on Mugman. Mugman was sent back, but caught himself on the rings ropes. Mugman dodged a punch to the face, and rapidly punched Alice in the stomach, before landing on uppercut. Alice fell down, but quickly got up to avoid losing. “I gotta dodge his punches for a while, until I can regain my stamina.”, Alice thought, dodging a jab from Mugman. Mugman slowed his jabs, trying to predict where she would dodge. But as Mugman tried to land another punch, he reimbursed the words of his sensei. “Don’t let your strength define you. Let your choices define who you are.”, Mugman thought, imaging his sensei fighting by his side. Mugman landed multiple punches and labs on Alice, and with landing the final blow, Alice was done. But, as Alice accepted her defeat, she felt something catch her by the collar. It was Mugman. “Stand still for ten seconds.”, Mugman instructed. Alice, in a daze, didn’t answer, but just stood there. Mugman walked over to one of the corners of the ring, and began to smash his head in. “He…he’s…he’s trying to initiate a tie…”, Alice thought, as she felt her legs become numb. And with the last blow to Mugmans head, both of the contestants fell to the floor, bruised and battered. The domain fell, and the two received their betted items back, not enhanced. Mugman used his Reversed Cursed Technique to heal his injuries, with Alice doing the same. “Why?”, Alice asked. “You had me on the final thread. Why give it up? Why give up ten times the energy you have now? Why give up the best statistics in jujutsu history?”, Alice asked, genuinely curious. “A wise person once told me that your strength doesn’t define who you are. It’s your choices. My strength is defined by my choices, and my choices defined me. I know what power can do to a person. It isn’t pretty. I didn’t want either of us to become absorbed by power, and do something risky that might chance the future maybe fifty, or a hundred years later. The future I want to make is the future that will become. A better world.”, Mugman said. Alice got up, dusting herself off. “Most sorcerers I know would’ve taken that chance and stomped my face in. But…you’re different. You’re the most respectable sorcerer I know now.”, Alice said, extending out her hand this time. “I’m Alice. Special Grade Sorcerer.”, Alice said with a smile on her face. Mugman shook her hand. “Mugman Grace, Second Grade Sorcerer.”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “So…uh…how did it go…?”, Bendy asked, looking at the two worried that one of them won. “It was a tie. And Alice is coming along with us.”, Mugman said. Alice confirmed, saying, “True dat.” “Alright, well, let’s head back to Tokyo. Our sensei is waiting to give us our next mission.”, Cuphead said, eating a chocolate stick. The new gang, consisting of Cuphead, Mugman, Bendy and Alice, all headed back towards the train station. We then cut to Tokyo, five hours later. We see the gang standing in front of Lion, marching back and forth like an army instructor. “Alright, guys. Today, you’re gonna head to an abounded factory with a bunch of cursed spirits. Two things: One, this might be a possible location of Jules finger. And two…”, Lion said, before continuing. “This might be a hideout of a sorcerer that went rogue 7 years ago. So, be on the lookout.”, Lion said. Most of the group just shrugged it off, but Mugman didn’t. Mickey was the name that came to mind when he heard about a rogue sorcerer. “We got it, sensei.”, they all said in unison. And with that, they set off. 4 hours later, they arrive. “Alright, here’s the plan. Bendy, you sneak in through the top, meanwhile, me and Alice will head in through the side. Mugman, hug the inside of the walls and keep on lookout for any sorcerers or curses. Got it, gang?”, Cuphead said. “Ahem. I believe that I’m the highest graded sorcerer, Cuphead.”, Alice said jokingly. “Shut up, Alice.”, Cuphead said. “Okay, Move out.”, Cuphead ordered, before everyone dashed so fast that they disappeared. Mugman cleared the outside, and reported, “no one outback. Red lobster, what do you see on the bottom floor with Wonder Woman?”, “Mugman, what are you talking about?”, Cuphead asked, genuinely confused. “Oh, I’m using code name! 8m Blue Jay, your Red Lobster, Alice is Wonder Woman, and Bendy is Lil’ Devil!”, Mugman said. “Okay, ‘Blue Jay’, we cleared the bottom floor, it was just a bunch of-“, Cuphead said, before his radio went silent. We see a sword go through Cupheads radio. “If I had practiced a little more, I would’ve pinned you to the wall.”, a mysterious figure said behind them. Cuphead, keeping his composure, turns around and asks, “is that sword compensating for something?” The mysterious figure smirks, and answers, “No, actually. It’s antique. old. And has a rope attached to it.”, as he pulls the sword back, cutting Cuphead on the nose. Alice then turns towards the figure. “Who even are you?”, Alice asks. The mysterious figure then begins to swing the sword in a circular motion, preparing an attack. “Why would I tell you that?”, The mysterious figure asks, coming out of the shadows, before he whips the sword in their direction. Cuphead and Alice ready their Cursed Techniques. “So that we can call you names while rubbing your face in the dirt.”, Alice says. The mysterious figure finally reveals himself to be Mickey. “Alright then. Let’s see if your sensei taught you well.”, Mickey says, before he swings his sword. Cuphead and Alice go on defense, staying back to back. Mickey then swings down from above, seemingly teleporting. “How come I can’t sense his cursed energy?”, Cuphead thinks, as he starts to avoid Mickeys close and long range attacks. Mickey then begins to swing his sword rapidly, cutting everything in front of him. “ALICE! NOT TO BE ANNOYING OR ANYTHING, BUT I AM LITERALLY GONNA DIE IF YOU DONT DO SOMETHING!”, Cuphead yelled, narrowing avoiding his head getting chopped off. Alice then summons a deck of cards, and throws them at Mickey. Mickey dashes again, this time in front of Alice. “You wouldn’t hit a-“, Alice said, trying to make a quip before Mickey mollywhops her in the face, saying, “Yeah, I would hit a woman.” Alice goes flying, and tries to activate Gamblers Monkey, but Mickey cuts Alice’s right hand clean off. Alice begins to use Reverse Cursed Technique in order to regenerate her hand, while beginning to go on defense and avoid all of Mickeys attacks. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Mugman crashes through the window. Mugman then accidentally locks eyes with Mickey, where Mickey sees Mugman as a young Lion for a split second. Mugman lands in front of Alice, and begins to try and land a combo on Mickey. Mickey quickly remembers this combo. “Oh, this is Lions. So, Lion taught these kids jujutsu, huh? Alright then. Lucky me, since he taught me these moves too. And how to counter them.”, Mickey thinks, as he blocks Mugmans combo. Mickey backs up, and sees Mugman, Cuphead and Alice in front of him. “So, if it isn’t Lions students. He’s been busy, huh? Training the next generation of sorcerers to fight his battles.”, Mickey says, engaging in banter with the trio. “Mickey, listen. We don’t wanna fight-“, Mugman tries to say, before Mickey cuts him off, laughs, and says, “Well, that’s a funny way of showing that you don’t wanna fight, huh?” Mugman frowns, and Cuphead steps up. “Whatever we do, we don’t wanna fight you. We just need some help.”, Cuphead says. “Help? Help you? Help the very institution I left? Help Lion? You all are as stubborn as he is. You kids don’t know how to make the best change in this world. Lion certainly didn’t.”, Mickey retorts, pointing out his sword. Mugman replied, “Mickey, please. Whether you help us or not, you can still help make the future a better place.” “You wanna know something very interesting? You sound JUST like him. You sound like Lion. Always thinking that there is another way. Without murder. Always talking about more options, and more chances. News Flash, Lion Jr., the world doesn’t work like that.”, Mickey said, tightening his grip on his sword. “Mickey, you once believed in changing the world, just like us. Maybe our way isn’t perfect, but it’s a start. Help us make it better.”, Mugman said. Mickey lowered his sword, and looked at Mugman. “I’m not promising anything, but I guess I’ll hear you guys out.”, Mickey said. Just then, Mickey coughed up some blood. Mickey then fell to one knee. “Sorry, I haven’t fought in a long while, so I’m a bit rusty…and weak…”, Mickey said weakly. “Oh, wait, here.”, Mugman said, finally letting his guard down and healing Mickey. Mickey is then healed back to full health and energy. “Thanks…”, Mickey said. “Hey…do you remember how I said I’d hear you out?”, Mickey asked with one eye open. Mugman looked at Mickey with a little confusion. Suddenly, within the blink of an eye, Mugman feels him arm fall of, followed by the COMPLETE ANNIHILATION OF THE BUILDING, AND LEAVING THE RUBBLE TO FALL ON THE GROUP. “I lied.”, Mickey stated, before putting his sword away. “Alright, now that I’m done with the three stooges, I can-“, Mickey stated, before he felt a sword swing, and cut the rope on his sword. “You said three stooges, right? Larry, Curly and Moe. Well, there was actually four. You just forgot the last one.”, Bendy said, holding his and Bendys sword. “Shemp.”, Bendy added.","output":"As Bendy squared off against Mickey, the tension in the rubble-strewn battleground was palpable. The shocked remains of Cuphead, Mugman, and Alice strained to recover beneath the collapsed structure, their eyes fixed on the unfolding duel above. Bendy\'s expression was a mix of determination and concern, aware of the monumental task at hand. Mickey, momentarily taken aback by Bendy\'s sudden involvement, quickly regained his composure, his smirk returning as though he relished the challenge. \\"Not often do I get to wipe the floor with four Jujutsu Sorcerers in one day,\\" Mickey taunted, spinning his now swordless rope as if it were a weapon of its own. \\"But hey, I\'m all for breaking records.\\" Bendy didn\'t rise to the bait. If he was phased, it didn\'t show. \\"You sure like to talk, huh?\\" Bendy retorted, his stance firm and ready. \\"Let\'s see if you can back it up.\\" The duo lunged at each other with a speed that was almost imperceptible, their movements blurring as they exchanged rapid-fire blows. Mickey, despite his earlier injury, moved with an agility that belied his years away from battle, his every action honed and deadly. Bendy, for his part, was no less skilled, parrying and countering with a precision that spoke volumes of his own prowess. Below, Mugman struggled to his feet, cursing the pain that shot through his body with every movement. Cuphead was already beside him, helping Alice who was gravely focused on reattaching her hand with a concentration that made her technique effective yet visibly draining. \\"We need to help Bendy,\\" Cuphead stated, his voice laced with urgency. Mugman nodded, knowing full well the high stakes of their mission. \\"Yeah, but first -\\" he winced as he invoked a quick healing technique, sealing his own wounds with a shaky spell, \\"- we regroup and strategize. Rushing in without a plan is exactly what Mickey wants.\\" Alice, now fully healed, joined the conversation, her gaze never leaving the intense battle overhead. \\"He\'s toying with us,\\" she said, a hint of fury coloring her tone. \\"We play smart, or we don\'t play at all.\\" The plan was hastily formed amidst the chaos, based on exploiting Mickey\'s overconfidence and creating an opening for a combined attack. It was a long shot, but it was all they had. Up above, as Bendy and Mickey continued their relentless dance of death, the rogue Sorcerer\'s overconfidence finally showed its first crack. A narrowly missed strike by Bendy clipped Mickey\'s cheek, drawing blood. The sudden realization that he was, in fact, not invincible seemed to flicker across Mickey\'s eyes. Seizing the moment, Bendy surged forward, pushing Mickey back with a barrage of ferocious attacks. Just as Mickey began to counter, he froze, sensing an ominous shift in the energy around him. It was too late. Mugman, Cuphead, and Alice emerged from the rubble, their combined cursed energy creating a tangible aura of power around them. They were battered, yes, but far from beaten. With a cry that echoed the resolve of every Jujutsu Sorcerer who had ever fought for a better future, they unleashed their cursed techniques in unison, aiming directly for Mickey. Caught off guard by the sudden turn of events and the intensity of the combined assault, Mickey barely had time to raise a defensive curse. The collision of energies was cataclysmic, sending shockwaves throughout the factory ruins and beyond. When the dust settled, all eyes were on the epicenter of the blast. Mickey lay there, subdued but alive, his expression a mix of disbelief and reluctant respect. Bendy, Mugman, Cuphead, and Alice stood victoriously, albeit exhausted, their unity and strategy having turned the tide. With Mickey now in custody, the team could finally return to Lion and debrief him on the mission\'s unexpected complications. As they limped back to headquarters, their camaraderie was evident – forged in battle and solidified in the shared dream of a world where curses no longer held sway. Mugman couldn\'t help but reflect on Lion\'s story about Mickey, and how close he came to making the same mistakes. He realized then that their strength lay not just in their cursed techniques or even their ambition to create a better future, but in their ability to choose a different path, one of compassion and understanding, even in the face of darkness. As the sun set on their battered forms, a new determination took root within them. Their journey was far from over, but with each other\'s support, there was no challenge they couldn\'t overcome. \\"I guess training under Lion really did pay off, huh?\\" Mugman mused, earning nods and grins from his companions. \\"Yeah,\\" Cuphead replied, \\"Let\'s just hope the next mission is a bit less... explosive.\\" Their laughter echoed into the evening, a testament to their enduring spirit and unshakeable bond. The road ahead was uncertain, but one thing was clear: they were ready for whatever came their way."},{"instruction":"ответить на вопрос: Национальные интересы и их учет в геополитике США. основываясь на тексте с сайта: https://pippiest.rssing.com/chan-2236684/latest.php#c2236684a1258","output":"Извините за недоразумение, но я не могу напрямую получить или читать содержание веб-сайтов, так как мои возможности ограничены моим тренировочным материалом, который останавливается в 2023 году. Однако, я могу предложить общее объяснение о том, как национальные интересы влияют на геополитические стратегии США. В геополитике США национальные интересы играют ключевую роль в формировании внешней политики и стратегических решений. Национальные интересы США часто включают обеспечение безопасности страны, продвижение экономического благосостояния, распространение демократических ценностей и укрепление международных альянсов и партнерств. Взаимоотношения с другими государствами, будь то союзники или конкуренты, оцениваются через призму этих интересов. Например, поддержка США НАТО и других международных альянсов отражает интерес в обеспечении коллективной безопасности, который, в свою очередь, защищает американский народ и поддерживает глобальный порядок, основанный на правилах. С другой стороны, конкуренция с крупными геополитическими силами, такими как Китай и Россия, побуждает США инвестировать в национальную оборону и развивать стратегии для укрепления своего влияния в важных регионах мира. Это также включает в себя дипломатические усилия и стратегические партнерства для продвижения экономических интересов и расширения экспорта американских товаров и услуг. Принятие решений в геополитике США обусловлено необходимостью защищать национальные интересы даже в сложной многосторонней среде, где американские лидеры должны учитывать не только внешние вызовы, но и внутреннее общественное и политическое давление. В конечном итоге, стремление США к сохранению своего глобального лидерства требует активного участия на международной арене и преследования таких целей, которые служат как его собственным интересам, так и общественным благам на глобальном уровне."},{"instruction":"what are the Most Commonly Used Periods in Creating RSI indicator?","output":"The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is most commonly used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a traded security, commodity, or currency. When creating the RSI indicator, the most commonly used time periods are: 1. **14 periods** - This is the default and most common setting for RSI. The period can be days, weeks, months, or even an intraday timeframe depending on the chart being analyzed. The original developer of RSI, J. Welles Wilder Jr., recommended using a 14-day period for calculation, as outlined in his seminal book \\"New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.\\" 2. **9 periods and 25 periods** - These are also used, albeit less frequently than the 14-period setting. Some traders prefer a 9-period RSI for a more sensitive indicator that reacts more quickly to price changes, making it potentially more suitable for shorter-term trading strategies. On the other hand, a 25-period RSI smooths out the movements more and might be favored for strategies focusing on longer-term trends. The choice of time period can significantly affect the RSI\'s sensitivity to price movements. A shorter period makes the RSI more volatile and likely to hit overbought and oversold levels. A longer period makes the RSI smoother but can delay the signals. Traders often adjust the period length based on their trading style and the time frame of their charts, with some even using multiple RSI settings on the same chart to get different perspectives on momentum. Ultimately, it\'s essential for traders to experiment with different settings and backtest their strategies with historical data to find the RSI period that works best for their trading approach."},{"instruction":"Why are you interested in Credit Karma? 作为一个数据科学家的背景，以及看好credit karma在fintech的前景来回答","output":"作为一个具有数据科学背景的专业人士，我对Credit Karma的兴趣主要来自于其在金融科技（fintech）领域所扮演的独特角色，特别是在个人信用和金融健康管理方面。以下是几个重点理由： 1. **数据驱动的决策制定**：Credit Karma作为一家领先的fintech公司，充分利用大数据和机器学习算法来提供个性化的信用和财务建议。这种做法不仅增强了用户体验，也提高了服务的精准度和效率。作为数据科学家，我对如何通过算法和模型改进服务和产品深感兴趣。 2. **影响力巨大的用户基础**：Credit Karma拥有庞大的活跃用户群，这为进行数据分析和洞察提供了丰富的资源。通过分析用户的财务行为和信用历史，可以揭示出模式和趋势，不仅对Credit Karma自身的产品开发至关重要，也为整个金融科技领域提供了宝贵的见解。 3. **前沿技术的运用**：Credit Karma在其服务中广泛运用了最新的技术，包括人工智能（AI）和机器学习（ML）。这种对新兴技术的采用不仅提升了用户的信贷管理能力，还助力于风险管理和欺诈预防。作为一名数据科学家，我特别看好这种技术驱动的创新能力和它为行业带来的改变。 4. **促进金融包容性**：Credit Karma致力于提供免费的信用评分和报告，这有助于提高人们的信用意识并促进金融包容性。通过教育用户如何改善他们的财务状况，Credit Karma在解决信用获取不平等的问题上发挥着重要作用。这种社会影响力是我作为数据科学家特别赞赏和看重的一个方面。 总的来说，我的兴趣不仅仅在于Credit Karma所使用的技术和数据科学方法，还包括它在促进金融知识普及、提高用户金融健康和推动整个fintech行业创新方面所发挥的作用。我相信，通过在Credit Karma这样的平台工作，我可以利用我的技能和知识为社会带来积极的影响。"},{"instruction":"Probability of high intent users is 25%, low intent users is 75%, high intent user 0.9 click rate, low intent user 0.1 click rate.Please draw a graph of likelihood of 0 clicking versus number of impressions.请用中文作答并作出解释","output":"要绘制点击率为0次与展示次数（impressions）之间关系的图形，我们首先需要理解概率计算的背景和过程。 给定的信息如下： - 高意向用户的概率是25% (记为 (P(H) = 0.25)) - 低意向用户的概率是75% (记为 (P(L) = 0.75)) - 高意向用户的点击率是0.9 (记为 (C(H) = 0.9)) - 低意向用户的点击率是0.1 (记为 (C(L) = 0.1)) 要计算任何用户（不考虑其意向强弱）点击0次的概率，我们可以首先计算不同用户类型的点击0次的概率，然后根据他们各自的总体概率加权平均这些概率。 对于一个给定的展示次数 (n)，高意向用户点击0次的概率为 (P(text{0点击|高意向}) = (1-C(H))^n = 0.1^n)，低意向用户点击0次的概率为 (P(text{0点击|低意向}) = (1-C(L))^n = 0.9^n)。 因此，任何用户点击0次的总体概率等于： [P(text{0点击}) = P(H) cdot P(text{0点击|高意向}) + P(L) cdot P(text{0点击|低意向})] 代入给定数值： [P(text{0点击}) = 0.25 cdot 0.1^n + 0.75 cdot 0.9^n] 这个公式给出了任何用户在给定展示次数 (n) 下点击0次的总体概率。为了绘制这个概率与展示次数之间的关系图，我们会计算在不同的 (n)（从1到某个较大值，比如10或20）时的 (P(text{0点击}))，然后在坐标图上绘制这些点。 这里不便提供实际的图形，但使用上述公式和一些编程工具（如Python的matplotlib库）或Excel，我们可以画出这样的曲线：随着展示次数 (n) 的增加，点击0次的概率会下降，且因为低意向用户占比较大且点击率较低，这个下降的趋势可能相对平缓。 这种分析帮助我们理解在不同用户群体和展示策略下，预期点击行为的变化，为广告投放策略和内容优化提供数据支持。"},{"instruction":"Based on the data above, The business only wants to place ads only to high intent users, is this a good idea?","output":"根据上述数据，只向高意向用户投放广告似乎是一个吸引人的策略，原因如下： 1. **高点击率**：高意向用户的点击率为0.9，这意味着几乎每次广告展示都很可能产生点击。这种高点击概率表明，如果广告内容与高意向用户的需求紧密相关，广告效果将会非常好。 2. **提高ROI**：广告投放的高效率（高点击率）可能会直接提高广告的投资回报率（ROI）。因为高意向用户更有可能对广告中的产品或服务作出反应，从而增加转化率和收益。 然而，在实施这种策略前，还需要考虑以下因素： - **用户基数限制**：只向高意向用户投放广告可能会大幅度减少潜在的观众基数。根据数据，高意向用户仅占25%，这限制了广告触达的范围。 - **市场饱和风险**：长期只针对高意向用户可能会导致这部分市场迅速饱和，降低未来的增长潜力。 - **成本考量**：因为高意向用户非常有价值，竞争对手也可能采取相同的策略，导致这部分用户的广告成本上升，可能会影响整体的成本效益。 - **数据和预测的精确性**：确定用户的“高意向”状态依赖于数据分析和预测模型。如果这些模型不够精确，可能会导致错误地识别高意向用户，从而降低广告效果。 因此，虽然只向高意向用户投放广告在短期内可能是一个有效的策略，但企业也应考虑长期的市场发展、成本效益和潜在的市场扩展。建议采用均衡的方法，对高意向用户进行重点关注的同时，不完全忽视其他群体，以确保广告策略的可持续性和广告投入的最大化回报。此外，不断优化用户意向识别模型，以提高精度，从而更准确地定向广告，也是提高广告效果的关键。"},{"instruction":"Var[X] = np(1-p) 这个在binomial里是设么意思？","output":"在二项分布（Binomial Distribution）中，(Var[X] = np(1-p)) 表示随机变量 (X)（即成功次数）的方差，其中 (n) 是试验次数，(p) 是每次试验成功的概率。 二项分布是描述在一系列相同的独立试验中，每次试验成功（发生某一特定事件）的概率都相同，求成功 (k) 次（(k=0,1,2,...,n)）的概率分布。它是一个离散概率分布。 在这个公式里： - (n) 是进行的试验次数； - (p) 是每次试验成功的概率； - (1-p) 是每次试验失败的概率； - (np) 代表成功次数的期望值（均值），即 (E[X])； - (Var[X]) 是随机变量 (X) 的方差，用于描述 (X) 分布的离散程度，即成功次数在其平均值周围变动的程度。 方差 (Var[X]) 的计算公式 [np(1-p)] 描述了在二项分布中，随机变量 (X) 的值围绕其期望值 (np) 变动时的平均程度。它是衡量分布或数据波动大小的量度，方差越大，数据的分散程度越高；方差越小，数据的集中程度越高。"},{"instruction":"python中的OOP是指什么？能不能用浅显易懂的语言解释","output":"OOP在Python中指的是“面向对象编程”（Object-Oriented Programming）。面向对象编程是一种程序设计范式，这种设计范式以“对象”为中心，将程序中的数据（属性）和操作这些数据的行为（方法）捆绑在一起形成“对象”，以此来模拟现实世界中的事务。 为了更浅显易懂地解释，我们可以将其比喻为制作玩具模型： - **类（Class）**：可以看作是制作玩具的蓝图或模板。它定义了玩具的基本结构和功能，比如一辆车的玩具模型，你可以设定它有四个轮子（属性）和一个能让它移动的功能（方法）。 - **对象（Object）**：根据类的定义，你制作出的具体玩具就是对象。如果类是车辆的模板，那么根据这个模板制作出的每一辆具体的玩具车都是一个对象。每个对象都有它自己的属性（比如颜色、大小）和方法（比如移动的方式）。 - **封装（Encapsulation）**：把车辆对象的具体细节（如轮子的数量，车的颜色等）隐藏起来，只暴露给外部一个简洁的操作界面。换句话说，你不需要知道车是如何移动的，只需要知道如何通过操作（如拨动开关）来让车移动。 - **继承（Inheritance）**：如果你已经有了一个类（如车辆类），你可以基于这个现有的类来创建新的类（如电动车类）。新的类继承了原有类的特性，并可添加新的特性或修改现有的某些功能。这就像你基于通用汽车模型的模板，创造出一种特殊类型的电动玩具车。 - **多态（Polymorphism）**：意味着“多种形态”。它允许我们用同一个接口代表不同的底层形态（类）。比如，我们有一个方法是“移动”，这个方法既可以适用于玩具车也可以适用于玩具船，虽然它们移动的方式不同（一辆车是滚动的，一艘船是浮动的）。 通过面向对象编程，Python使得程序的组织和管理变得更直观、更接近现实世界的事物操作，同时也便于代码的复用和维护。"},{"instruction":"如果作为一个数据科学家的面试，面试官准备考察python oop的内容，一般会出什么样的问题？能否举个例子？","output":"在数据科学领域的面试中，考察Python面向对象编程（OOP）的问题，通常旨在评估候选人是否能够理解和应用OOP的基本概念来解决数据处理和分析中的问题。以下是一些可能会出现的问题类型以及举例： # 1.

It\'s often used in technical analysis to smooth out price data and help identify trends over time. The most commonly used periods for creating the EMA indicator vary among traders and depend on the trading strategy, timeframe, and market. However, some of the typical periods used include: 1. **9 and 12 Periods EMA**: Often used for short-term trends, especially in day trading. The 9 and 12 periods EMAs are popular among stock and forex traders looking for quick, responsive signals. 2. **26 and 50 Periods EMA**: These are used for intermediate trends. The 26-period EMA is especially significant in the cryptocurrency market (largely because it\'s part of the calculation for the MACD indicator), as well as in stocks and forex. The 50 period EMA is a good measure for medium-term trends and is closely watched by many traders. 3. **100 and 200 Periods EMA**: These are used for identifying long-term trends. The 200-period EMA is particularly well-regarded across various markets as a major indicator of a significant support or resistance level. The 100-period EMA also provides a good indication of a long-term trend but is more sensitive to price changes than the 200 EMA. Different traders might use these EMAs in various combinations to generate signals. For example, some might look for crossovers between a short-term EMA (like the 12-period) and a longer-term EMA (like the 26-period) as potential buy or sell signals. The choice of period depends largely on the individual\'s trading style (day trading, swing trading, position trading, etc.) and the specific characteristics of the market being traded. Traders often experiment with different EMA periods and combinations to find what best fits their strategy and market conditions."},{"instruction":"This is fanfiction.

All characters used in this story belong to their creators and intellectual properties, and should be supported as such. Characters from Cuphead, Bendy and the Ink Machine, and many other possible character from other franchises might pop up, and they belong to their respective franchises, so again, I ask you to support the creators of the characters. In other words, this is fan fiction, don’t freak out. We open in on Mugman sleeping, but then he hears his alarm go off. “My name is Mugman Grace, and I’m a jujutsu sorcerer.”, He narrates, while we see Mugmans daily routine play in the background. “What? Too much. Okay, well, let’s take it from the top.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we rewind to flashbacks of Chapter One. We see Mugman eating the “pickle”, Mugman fighting Bendy, and Mugman about to activate his domain. “A few months ago, I ate a special grade cursed object, which incarnated inside me, and turned me into a vessel for the king of curses, Jules. After that, I was set up for a secret execution, but only after I ate all of Jules, which would take a while. After that, I became a jujutsu sorcerer. And for the past three months, I’ve been a grade 2 sorcerer. So far I’ve consumed nine out of twenty fingers, so I have about 11 fingers left to eat. Or, I’d say about another three months left to live. But I’ll make it worth it by making the world a better place. Lemme introduce you to my squad.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we see Mugman eat breakfast. An image appears of Cuphead, before Mugman introduces Cuphead. “This is my brother, Cuphead. He’s a grade two sorcerer, and his cursed technique allows him to…do stuff with robots or something, I honestly forgot because he doesn’t show it off much.” Then, an image of Bendy lands on Cupheads picture. “This is Bendy. He’s my friend, and a grade four sorcerer, so he’s pretty tough. His cursed technique allows him to command people or objects to do stuff by saying words from the English vocabulary.”, Mugman says, before an image of Lion lands on top of the picture of Bendy and Cuphead. “And this is my teacher, or sensei, Lion. His cursed technique allows him to channel his cursed energy into certain parts of his body, and protect it or reinforce it. It can also double the damage he does.”, Lion says. “And my cursed technique…is pretty hard to explain, so I’ll try my best.”, Mugman says, before a presentation appears. Mugman appears in a teacher outfit with glasses, and adjusts them before he turns on the presentation. “My cursed technique has three functions: Dismantle, Cleave and Erase. Dismantle is one big clean cut. Cleave is like a grid of slices, and they basically chop up my opponent into pieces. And Erase…erases the space-like, LITERAL space-in front of me, and it makes me dash pretty fast. Unfortunately, this last one I don’t use too much, so, it doesn’t have much use.”, Mugman explains. “Yes, rag doll number seventy eight in the back?”, Mugman says, pointing out into a class full of training dummies. “Are you gonna talk about cursed tools, domain expansions, and cursed energy?”, the dummy says, obviously being controlled by Mugman. “Oh, yeah. Uhh, not now, but when we come to those, we’ll explain it. Now, are we all up to speed? Good! Now, I gotta get back to eating, cause today’s a mission. And my partner is my brother. You’ve all met him, I’m sure.”, Mugman says, before we cut back to him putting on his uniform. “Hey, Mugman? You done yet? I’ve been waiting for like, twenty minutes.”, Cuphead says, leaning against Mugmans door. “Yeah, I’m coming, Cuphead.”, Mugman says, before he grabs EWF( Earth, Wind and Fire. Mugmans cursed tool infused with cursed energy. It’s a double sided combat knife), and walks out his door. “C’mon.”, Cuphead says, and they walk out, and head towards heir mission. A hour later, they arrive. “So, Cuphead? What’s the deal here?”Mugman asked, looking at the old office building. “Same as always, Mug.”, Cuphead said disinterested. “Cursed Spirit sightings and possible location of Jules finger?”, Mugman asked, letting out a sigh of tiredness. “Right on the money, Mug.”, Cuphead said. “I don’t know why we have to deal with the grade four curses…”, Mugman said mopingly. “Me too, but you don’t see me crying. Now come on, Mugman. We got a finger for you to eat.”, Cuphead said, before he headed inside. They walked through the halls, while Mugman was staring at his phone, watching TikTok. They turn a corner, and see a grade four curse. “It’s not the one we’re looking for.”, Cuphead said casually, walking towards it. Mugman, still looking down at his phone, sliced through it with ease, and kept walking. “Hey, Cuphead? After this, can we get McDonalds?”, Mugman asked, looking at Cuphead. “Didn’t you JUST eat breakfast, Mugman?”, Cuphead asked, annoyed. At the same time, a grade three spirit lunged at Cuphead from behind. “12:00 o’clock, Cuphead.”, Mugman said casually. Cuphead, without even looking away from Mugman, smashed the cursed spirit into pieces with one hand. “Also, yeah, but I want a McDonalds biscuit. Oh, and a cookie!”, Mugman said. Cuphead decided for a moment, and answered, “Fine with me, but you gotta talk to Lion about that.”, Cuphead said. “You know how he is when you eat out without him, Mug.”, Cuphead added. “Alright.”, Mugman agreed. And so, they kept walking. They eventually reached the main part of the office, and they found the finger, just sitting in the middle of the room, all alone. “It’s a trap.”, Cuphead said. “Oh, really, Captain Obvious? And what made it apparent that this is a trap?”, Mugman said sarcastically. “Fine then. Be that way.”, Cuphead said, walking over to the finger. “You literally just said that it’s a trap, and you still go for it? Are you stupid?”, Mugman asked. “No, I’m strong. That’s why.”, Cuphead said, crouching down to grab the finger. But as he touched the finger, he felt plastic. “It’s a dud.”, Cuphead said, before a grade four cursed spirit crashed from the wall above, lunging down on Cuphead. Cuphead dashed back, as he saw the cursed spirit laugh at the two for taking the bait. “Okay, you’re strong, but you’re not smart.”, Mugman said casually. “Let’s just exorcise this thing already.”, Cuphead said, annoyed at Mugman. “I was hoping you’d say that.”, Mugman said, before the two dashed and disappeared. Mugman appeared behind the cursed spirit, and hit him with a Cleave. He then kicked the spirit into Cuphead, who used his technique to capture the spirit. However, the spirit used its technique, and phased through the cage Cuphead had made. Mugman used Erase and dashed toward the cursed spirit, sending it out the window. He then dashed down, and took out EWF, and tried to cut off the cursed spirits head. However, he made EWF phase through Mugmans hand, and unphased it at the perfect time to cut off Mugmans hand. Mugman let go of the cursed spirit and used Reverse Cursed Technique to heal and regenerate his hand. Cuphead jumped down as well, and grabbed Mugmans hands. He then quickly scan Mugman and threw him down to kick the cursed spirit again. This time, Mugman made a donut out of the cursed spirit, putting a hole through the spirit. Mugman landed on the ground firmly, and dashed away, careful not to get crushed under the cursed spirit. Meanwhile, Cuphead, still falling with the cursed spirit, he created a whip out of the falling debris, and sent cursed energy through the rope, and hit the spirit the exact time the cursed energy had reached the end of the rope and hit the spirit, creating a Black Flash. The monster was smashed into the ground, and Cuphead landed easily. “Is it over?”, Mugman asked. Then, the spirit began to get back up, healing the donut hole in its belly. “Nope.”, Cuphead said. Mugman then began to think on how to defeat this thing. If his duo attack didn’t work, he might have to use his domain expansion, but he can’t use it while Cupheads around. So, Mugman made a risky move. “I’ll take it on myself, you go and get Bendy.”, Mugman said, dead serious. “Mugman,you’re joking. There is no way in heaven or hell you’re taking on this thing.”, Cuphead said. “Exactly, I’m just buying some time. Go. Get. Bendy.”, Mugman said. Cuphead quickly left. “Alright, cursed spirit. It’s time to exorcise you.”, Mugman said. Mugman stood firmly, and put out his hands, focusing his energy while doing so. “Domain Expansion…”, Mugman said carefully. But as Mugman was about to finish the domain expansion, he saw the cursed spirit was about to unleash its own domain expansion. “Alright, then!”, Mugman said, smirking. “RIGID COFFIN OF THE DEVIL HIMSELF!”, Mugman said, as his domain began to shape, clashing with the cursed spirits domain expansion, “The Cobweb of Asinine Angels.” Mugman hits the sprit with a dismantle, sending a line of lava the spirits way, but the spirit blocks it with a chain from his domain. Then, the cursed spirit sends out his hands, also sending two chains at Mugman. Mugman dodges him, and tries to hit the cursed spirit with a Cleave. The spirit attempts to block it, but is still hit. The spirit then begins to regenerate, as he starts raising more chains to try and attack Mugman with. Meanwhile, Mugman is panicking, trying to make his domain stable, since it’s running out of energy. Mugman prepares one final attack, but it’s one he hasn’t used before. “Cursed Energy Charge: Red.”, Mugman says, holding out his hand like a gun. A ball made of pure cursed energy begins to form at the tip of Mugmans finger, and then Mugman says, “Blast.” The blast is blasted, and the cursed spirit is destroyed, leaving only the finger. Mugman lets go of his domain, and he falls to the floor. But before he passes out, he grabs the finger, and he gulps it down. Then, Mugman passes out. Mugman wakes up in his dorm, feeling burnt out. Mugman looks around, and sees Bendy at his side, waiting for him to wake up. Bendy looks back at Mugman, to see that he’s awake. “Mugman, you alright? You managed to defeat a special grade curse. So I’m guessing that you aren’t.”, Bendy says, seemingly tired. “Wait…that was a special grade…? But I thought it was-“, Mugman asked, before Bendy cut him off, stating, “Grade four? When normal, weak curses usually around grade four or three eat a special grade object, they usually get infused with that cursed objects power. That’s why it was so strong.”, Bendy said. “Wow…how do you know that…?”, Mugman asked, staring at the ceiling. “It’s common knowledge among sorcerers, Mug.”, Bendy said. But, he was actually just reading from a book about curses. “Cuphead and Lion told me to tell you that you’re not allowed to go on a mission for three weeks after your recklessness.”, Bendy said. “What…?! But I got rid of the special-grade…! I should be…like…promoted…! You can get promoted in jujutsu sorcery, right…?”, Mugman asked, sad. “Well, it’s not like jail, Mug. You can’t beat up the biggest, baddest, toughest guy and expect to be the strongest. It’s not like that. You gotta earn it by first taking down small fry. So, your on downtime for three weeks. Think of it like…vacation, Mug.”, Bendy said, getting up, and leaving. “Oh, yeah. One more thing. Lion told me that you should focus your downtime on training, since you have yet to actually train.”, Bendy said, before leaving Mugmans room. Mugman laid there for a few seconds, before getting off the side of his bed. “A special-grade curse, huh? Gotta say, Mug-brat, I’m impressed. Maybe you’ll actually have a chance to beat me once I leave your body. Or, take control. Either way, I’ll win in the end.”, Jules said, with one of the mini mouths on Mugman. “Is all you do just hype yourself, Jules? You cannot go a day without glazing yourself, can you?”, Mugman said, annoyed. “Hey, I was the greatest sorcerer in history. If I can hype myself, who can?”, Jules said smugggishly. “Oh, I don’t know, maybe people you actually let leave ALIVE.”, Mugman said, as he began to put on his uniform. “Mug-brat, are you deaf? Your classmate said that you’re on break, so what’s the reason for the suit?”, Jules asked confused, but still smug. “He can’t tell me what to do, so I’m gonna go talk to the king of the jungle.”, Mugman said, putting on his shoes. “Right here, pal.”, Jules said, before laughing. “I’m talking about Lion, you Agamemnon.”, Mugman said, before he whacked Jules mouth. “Yeesh. Tough crowd.”, Jules replied, before his mouth disappeared. Mugman began to walk towards lions office, both angry and scared about the conversation ahead. He walked into lions office. “Hey, Mug, what’s up?”, Lion said, filing some paperwork. “Um, Lion, I wanted to talk to you about my three weeks off.”, Mugman said. “Alright, spit.”, Lion said, preparing to listen. “So, I know that I was reckless, and I took on a special grade spirit-and won, by the way-, and almost died, and I gotta recover properly, but I gotta get back out there. I mean, I probably have three, or, if we find them quickly, 2 months left to live! I don’t wanna spend even SOME of that time just sitting around, throwing a ball at a wall! I wanna make a difference, and change the world, make it better for people, and for those people’s children, and for those children’s children!”, Mugman argued. “I see…”, Lion said. “Before I die, I wanna help people, make a change! Like you! Your a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help! I find that very, very confusing, Lion! So, please! Let me help! I’m string, and you could do it with me!”, Mugman argued again. “…Mugman.”, Lion began. “Do you like stories?”, Lion asked. “Uh, yeah…? But, what’s that have to do with-“, Mugman asked, before Lion cut him off. “Let me tell you a story, then, Mugman. A story about a young sorcerer, who wanted to change the world.”, Lion said. We cut to 2007, in Japan. We see two young sorcerers walking down the street. “So, what are we clowning around for, Lion”? The other sorcerer said. We then see a young, second grade sorcerer Lion walking down the street, drinking water. “What teach’ told us to do, Mickey. Just get rid of some of the cursed spirits in the area.”, Lion said to his best friend, Mickey. “This is so stupid. I say we just get rid of the people in the area, then boom, no cursed sprints in the area.”, Mickey said annoyed. “Yeah, well, we’re not like the police or something.”, Lion said, drinking from his water bottle. “Yeah, because we’re something better-Jujutsu sorcerers.”, Mickey said. “Wanna hit the arcade after this to make you feel better, BaAaBy?”, Lion said, treating Mickey like a cranky toddler. “Shut up, Lion. But fine.”, Mickey said, groaning. “Cool.”, Lion said, throwing his water bottle in the air, and then evaporating it. “Alright. We’re here.”, Mickey said, standing up straight. “Alright, let’s kick some cursed butt.”, Lion said, before walking in. “Yeah, what you said.”, Mickey said tiredly, before following behind. Lion takes care of a grade four curse, and Mickey turns it into a ball, and swallows it. “Blech. It’s so gross that it almost makes you laugh.”, Mickey said, rubbing his throat. “But it’s worth it, cause then you can-“, Lion said, before Lion and Mickey said, “Control the curse and make it fight.”, at the same time. “Yeah, I know, Lion. But they taste disgusting.”, Mickey said. “They taste like literal trash.”, Mickey added. “Well, they’re pure negativity, so maybe that’s the reason.”, Lion said jokingly. “Well, maybe we need to get rid of the source of the negativity.”, Mickey said. “…you know we can’t kill non-sorcerers, Mick. That’s wrong.”, Lion said, now serious. “You have to make two wrongs to make a right, Right?”, Mickey said, now facing Lion. “Sometimes two wrongs can make three wrongs, Mick.”, Lion said. “It would be the easiest way. They don’t have any curse energy, let alone a technique. So, why can’t we get rid of the people that make the curses? Why can’t we get rid of the source of the problem?”, Mickey said, now angry. “Cause it’s not right. If we kill all non-sorcerers, jujutsu wouldn’t exist, the world would end, and eventually, we would become the humans, and curses would still linger.”, Lion said. “It would still be better with no people. You could do it Lion.”, Mickey said. “You could get rid of all non-sorcerers. You could make the world a better place. You could help save the world from the evil that lives, breathes, eats, rids on the world. Non-sorcerers.”, Mickey explained. “Mickey, it just isn’t right.”, Lion said. “Are you strong because your Lion? Or are you Lion because you’re strong?”, Mickey asked. “What are you trying to say?”, Lion asked. “I’m asking if your strength defines who you are. Because it doesn’t. One day, Lion. I’ll make the world a better place, I just have to make it.”, Mickey explained. “I wanna help people. I wanna make a change. Like you. You’re a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help. I find that very, very confusing, Lion. So, please. Let me help. I’m strong, and you could do it with me.”, Mickey asked. “Help me eliminate all non-sorcerers.”, Mickey asked again. A moment of silence fell upon the two, before Lion replied, saying, “Killing innocent people, regardless of whether they’re sorcerers or not, doesn’t solve the root problem. It only perpetuates a cycle of hatred and fear. We have to be better. We have to find another way. I’m sorry, Mickey, I can’t. I just can’t. My hands are tied, and you don’t see your error.”, Lion said. “Fine then. If you don’t stand by me, you stand in front of me. You’re in my way.”, Mickey said, beginning to ready his Cursed Technique to fight. “Mickey, please. You’re my friend. I don’t wanna fight you.”, Lion said, preparing his cursed technique for defense, not wanting to hurt Mickey. “I wouldn’t wanna fight me either.”, Mickey said, before sending out a grade three curse at Lion. Lion dodged, and tried to reason with Mickey. “Mickey, come on! This isn’t you.”, Lion said, outrunning the curse chasing him. “You’re right, Lion. This isn’t me. This is the new me.”, Mickey said, and with a swift motion of his hand, the curse swept Lion into a wall. Lion used his cursed technique to reinforce his body in order to not take damage. “Mickey, listen to what you’re saying. You want to kill innocent people to make a better place.”, Lion said, dashing towards Mickey, preparing to disarm him. “You have to get rid of non-innocents to make innocents.”, Mickey said. Lion jumped up, and prepared to kick Mickey. But just about when he was gonna kick, he stopped. “Mickey, please. I’m your friend. Let me help.”, Lion said, holding onto Mickeys shoulder. “I don’t need any help.”, Mickey said, brushing off lions hand. “And I’m not your friend.”, Mickey said, before Mickey left, not just the building. But lions friendship. The jujutsu high school. We then cut back to present day. “It’s been five years ever since that day occurred.”, Lion said, tears running down his face. “Your room…it was Mickeys. It was ours.”, Lion said. “So, what happened to Mickey…?”, Mugman asked, feeling a lump grow in his throat. “I don’t know. I haven’t seen him since.”, Lion said. “I tell you this, Mugman, so that you learn that your strength does not define who you are, it does not define the world. Your choices define what you are. And what you do.”, Lion said, now crying. “I…I understand, sensei.”, Mugman said, now also tearing up. “During these three weeks…can you teach me all you know?”, Mugman asked. “I’d be happy to, Mugman.”, Lion said, putting down his pen. And so, Mugman trained relentlessly. And then his suspension was up. We cut to three weeks later, with Mugman, Bendy, and Cuphead heading to Kanto, to go and recruit another sorcerer from their sister school. “So, who are we picking up?”, Mugman asked, while playing Flappy Bird on his phone. “Alice.”, Cuphead said, looking out of the window. “Oh. Does she have a cursed technique?”, Mugman asked. “Yeah, obviously, Mugman.”, Cuphead replied. “What is it?”, Mugman asked. “It’d be too good to spoil you, Mugman. But just know this: When she gets worked up…her power is comparable to Jules.”, Bendy said. “Whaaaat? You’re lying.”, Mugman said, not believing Bendy. “Trust me, Mugman.”, Bendy said. Then, the train stops, and the location says that they’ve arrived in Kanto. “Alright, let’s go to our sister school.”, Cuphead said, leading the group. “How is it that you’re a grade two sorcerer leading the group, but I’m a grade THREE sorcerer being led by a lower class?”, Bendy said frustrated. “Dunno, don’t care.”, Cuphead said. Eventually, after about an hour of walking, they arrive at their sister school. Cuphead and his gang walk in, and check in with this schools principal/sensei. They then go to Alice’s room. Mugman knocks on the door. “Ugh, who is it?”, a voice said from inside the room. “Chicka-chicka boom boom.”, Bendy said out of nowhere. Suddenly, the room got quiet, and Alice opened the door. “Bendy?”, Alice asked. “Hey, you remembered the signal!”, Bendy said happily. “And uh…who are these losers?”, Alice asked, whispering to Bendy. “Oh, there with me. We need to recruit you for a mission.”, Bendy whispered back. “Oh.”, Alice said. Alice stepped back, and looked at Mugman and Cuphead. “And you guys are…?”, Alice asked. Mugman raised his hand, and introduced himself. “Hi! I’m Mugman, Grade Two sorcerer!”, Mugman said happily. “Nice to meet you.”, Mugman added, extending his hand. Alice then glared at Cuphead. “I’m Cuphead.”, Cuphead said, looking away. Alice stared at the two for a minute. “This…’Mugman’ guy looks weird. Definitely the kid that ate his own boogers. Does he even have a cursed technique? And Cuphead thinks that he’s the GOAT, by just telling me his name.”, Alice thought. “Why am I always stuck with the weird ones.”, Alice said, sighing. “We need you cause your ‘apparently’, pretty strong.”, Mugman said, with skepticism and sarcasm in his voice. Alice gritted her teeth at Mugman. “And what’s that supposed to mean, you little narc?”, Alice said, angry. “What I’m saying is that I don’t believe that you’re that tough that you could rival Jules in power. I mean…”, Mugman says, about to say something to set Alice off. “…you’re a girl!”, Mugman said. Alice’s top blew off. “Alright then, dippy. Let’s spar right here, right now. “Okay.”, Mugman said. Alice and Mugman then head out into the field. Mugman stands still,e doe ting Alice to be on the level of a grade one sorcerer. Alice ready her stance. “Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey.”, Alice states, before a pair of die appear before Alice. Alice then pulls out one of her weapons, and places it down. “Bet one of your items, or anything that you have.”, Alice said. Mugman, underestimating her, places down EWF. Suddenly, both of their items are sucked into the dice, and Alice pockets the dice. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off.”, Alice said, activating her domain expansion. Suddenly, a black dome surrounds the two, and the two are placed in a card game of War. “What the? Why are we playing War?”, Mugman thought. Mugman dashed to get up and attack Alice, but was quickly placed back down into the chair. “Ah, ah, ah.”, Alice said, waving her finger. “You already made a bet. Now you have to play the game.”, Alice said. Suddenly, Mugmans mind was filled with the rules of her technique. Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey When this Cursed Technique activates, it summons a pair of die. After the die are summoned, the two people fighting are forced to put one thing they have on a “bet”, that if either of them lose the “bet”, that object or anything that they had bet is destroyed beyond repair. When both players have placed their “bets”, the person with this cursed technique (gamblers monkey), activates their Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off, which puts the opponent and the other opponent either in a boxing arena, a game of cards (can be blackjack, poker or war), or puts them back at the betting stage to bet one more item. If either of them lose any of the challenges or refuses to put down something to bet, that person, along with their item(or items that they betted), are eradicated. If either of the players lose in one of the battles, they, and their betted item, are eradicated. The Domain Expansion for this cursed technique is automatic, and does not require cursed energy to activate or form. “Woah, this is how the game functions, huh?”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “Yup, glad that I gave you the rules, huh?”, Alice said with a smirk. “Sure.”, Mugman said, before he drew a card, and they both began to play the game. As they were playing the game, Mugman thought about how unique her technique was. It wasn’t one made for fighting, it was made for gambling, Which he thought was honestly pretty cool. It’s not everyday that you get to see cursed techniques like this, let alone, cursed techniques that aren’t inherited or copied. Mugman put down a card, and with that swift motion, Mugman won the game. The domain dissipates, and the pair of die fly out of Alice’s pocket. Suddenly, Mugmans EWF drops in front of him, while the dice holding Alice’s weapons shivers, and then cracks, and dies. Alice grits her teeth, while Mugman hold EWF in his hand, looking at its new design and material. “Woah, what happened to my weapon?”, Mugman said, asking Alice. Alice, still angry about her loss, answers Mugman, “When you win against my technique, it enhances the item or whatever you betted by tenfold.”, Alice said. “Cool!”, Mugman stated. “Alice…”, Mugman began to ask. “I want to gamble again.”, Mugman asked. Alice looked up. “Half of my lifespan, if I lose, goes away. If I win, my cursed energy is increased by tenfold, and remains that way from now on.”, Mugman said. “MUGMAN, ARE YOU CRAZY?! YOU DONT WANNA BET LIKE THAT, THATS TOO RISKY!”, Bendy yelled. Alice grinned. “THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO SEE! I LIKE TO SEE HIGH STAKES!”, Alice yelled with a grin. “I accept your bet, Mugman. If I win, I get half of your remaining lifespan, but if I lose, the cursed energy that you receive that multiplies your cursed energy tenfold will be my own cursed energy!”, Alice yelled. Mugman also grinned. “Let’s do it!”, he yelled. Alice threw out the die once more, and the die absorbed Mugmans cursed energy, and half of his life. The other die absorbed Alice’s Cursed energy. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off!”, Alice yelled. A black dome surrounded the two, and the two were placed into a boxing ring. “This is it, Mugman. This is the coin toss that decides our fate. Let’s hope that we win.”, Alice said, grinning. “Good luck.”, Mugman said, getting into a boxing stance. “I don’t need luck. I’m full of it.”, Alice said, starting off the boxing match with a right hook, followed by a jab to the stomach. Mugman blocks the right hook, but is punched in his gut. Mugman retaliates with 3 right jabs, followed by a left hook, and three right jabs, all to the face. Alice blocked the last few, after being hit by the first few. Alice tried to juke Mugman by winding up a left hook, only to throw a right jab. Mugman didn’t fall for it though, dodging the right jab, before mollywhopping Alice in the face, sending her into the ropes of the ring. Alice relaxed for a minute, before pushing back on the ropes, sending herself flying into Mugman. Alice threw a flurry of punches at Mugman, with some landing, and some being blocked. Mugman threw a right hook at the same time Alice also threw a right hook, leaving them at a temporary standstill. “You’re good. You’ve been practicing?”, Alice asked sarcastically. “You know, I’m something of an athlete myself.”, Mugman answered, before following a jab that lasted for 0.01 seconds. Alice was sent back by the jab, both surprised and injured. Alice let herself fall down to avoid another jab by Mugman, before catching her self, and pushing herself back up to land a left hook on Mugman. Mugman was sent back, but caught himself on the rings ropes. Mugman dodged a punch to the face, and rapidly punched Alice in the stomach, before landing on uppercut. Alice fell down, but quickly got up to avoid losing. “I gotta dodge his punches for a while, until I can regain my stamina.”, Alice thought, dodging a jab from Mugman. Mugman slowed his jabs, trying to predict where she would dodge. But as Mugman tried to land another punch, he reimbursed the words of his sensei. “Don’t let your strength define you. Let your choices define who you are.”, Mugman thought, imaging his sensei fighting by his side. Mugman landed multiple punches and labs on Alice, and with landing the final blow, Alice was done. But, as Alice accepted her defeat, she felt something catch her by the collar. It was Mugman. “Stand still for ten seconds.”, Mugman instructed. Alice, in a daze, didn’t answer, but just stood there. Mugman walked over to one of the corners of the ring, and began to smash his head in. “He…he’s…he’s trying to initiate a tie…”, Alice thought, as she felt her legs become numb. And with the last blow to Mugmans head, both of the contestants fell to the floor, bruised and battered. The domain fell, and the two received their betted items back, not enhanced. Mugman used his Reversed Cursed Technique to heal his injuries, with Alice doing the same. “Why?”, Alice asked. “You had me on the final thread. Why give it up? Why give up ten times the energy you have now? Why give up the best statistics in jujutsu history?”, Alice asked, genuinely curious. “A wise person once told me that your strength doesn’t define who you are. It’s your choices. My strength is defined by my choices, and my choices defined me. I know what power can do to a person. It isn’t pretty. I didn’t want either of us to become absorbed by power, and do something risky that might chance the future maybe fifty, or a hundred years later. The future I want to make is the future that will become. A better world.”, Mugman said. Alice got up, dusting herself off. “Most sorcerers I know would’ve taken that chance and stomped my face in. But…you’re different. You’re the most respectable sorcerer I know now.”, Alice said, extending out her hand this time. “I’m Alice. Special Grade Sorcerer.”, Alice said with a smile on her face. Mugman shook her hand. “Mugman Grace, Second Grade Sorcerer.”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “So…uh…how did it go…?”, Bendy asked, looking at the two worried that one of them won. “It was a tie. And Alice is coming along with us.”, Mugman said. Alice confirmed, saying, “True dat.” “Alright, well, let’s head back to Tokyo. Our sensei is waiting to give us our next mission.”, Cuphead said, eating a chocolate stick. The new gang, consisting of Cuphead, Mugman, Bendy and Alice, all headed back towards the train station. We then cut to Tokyo, five hours later. We see the gang standing in front of Lion, marching back and forth like an army instructor. “Alright, guys. Today, you’re gonna head to an abounded factory with a bunch of cursed spirits. Two things: One, this might be a possible location of Jules finger. And two…”, Lion said, before continuing. “This might be a hideout of a sorcerer that went rogue 7 years ago. So, be on the lookout.”, Lion said. Most of the group just shrugged it off, but Mugman didn’t. Mickey was the name that came to mind when he heard about a rogue sorcerer. “We got it, sensei.”, they all said in unison. And with that, they set off. 4 hours later, they arrive. “Alright, here’s the plan. Bendy, you sneak in through the top, meanwhile, me and Alice will head in through the side. Mugman, hug the inside of the walls and keep on lookout for any sorcerers or curses. Got it, gang?”, Cuphead said. “Ahem. I believe that I’m the highest graded sorcerer, Cuphead.”, Alice said jokingly. “Shut up, Alice.”, Cuphead said. “Okay, Move out.”, Cuphead ordered, before everyone dashed so fast that they disappeared. Mugman cleared the outside, and reported, “no one outback. Red lobster, what do you see on the bottom floor with Wonder Woman?”, “Mugman, what are you talking about?”, Cuphead asked, genuinely confused. “Oh, I’m using code name! 8m Blue Jay, your Red Lobster, Alice is Wonder Woman, and Bendy is Lil’ Devil!”, Mugman said. “Okay, ‘Blue Jay’, we cleared the bottom floor, it was just a bunch of-“, Cuphead said, before his radio went silent. We see a sword go through Cupheads radio. “If I had practiced a little more, I would’ve pinned you to the wall.”, a mysterious figure said behind them. Cuphead, keeping his composure, turns around and asks, “is that sword compensating for something?” The mysterious figure smirks, and answers, “No, actually. It’s antique. old. And has a rope attached to it.”, as he pulls the sword back, cutting Cuphead on the nose. Alice then turns towards the figure. “Who even are you?”, Alice asks. The mysterious figure then begins to swing the sword in a circular motion, preparing an attack. “Why would I tell you that?”, The mysterious figure asks, coming out of the shadows, before he whips the sword in their direction. Cuphead and Alice ready their Cursed Techniques. “So that we can call you names while rubbing your face in the dirt.”, Alice says. The mysterious figure finally reveals himself to be Mickey. “Alright then. Let’s see if your sensei taught you well.”, Mickey says, before he swings his sword. Cuphead and Alice go on defense, staying back to back. Mickey then swings down from above, seemingly teleporting. “How come I can’t sense his cursed energy?”, Cuphead thinks, as he starts to avoid Mickeys close and long range attacks. Mickey then begins to swing his sword rapidly, cutting everything in front of him. “ALICE! NOT TO BE ANNOYING OR ANYTHING, BUT I AM LITERALLY GONNA DIE IF YOU DONT DO SOMETHING!”, Cuphead yelled, narrowing avoiding his head getting chopped off. Alice then summons a deck of cards, and throws them at Mickey. Mickey dashes again, this time in front of Alice. “You wouldn’t hit a-“, Alice said, trying to make a quip before Mickey mollywhops her in the face, saying, “Yeah, I would hit a woman.” Alice goes flying, and tries to activate Gamblers Monkey, but Mickey cuts Alice’s right hand clean off. Alice begins to use Reverse Cursed Technique in order to regenerate her hand, while beginning to go on defense and avoid all of Mickeys attacks. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Mugman crashes through the window. Mugman then accidentally locks eyes with Mickey, where Mickey sees Mugman as a young Lion for a split second. Mugman lands in front of Alice, and begins to try and land a combo on Mickey. Mickey quickly remembers this combo. “Oh, this is Lions. So, Lion taught these kids jujutsu, huh? Alright then. Lucky me, since he taught me these moves too. And how to counter them.”, Mickey thinks, as he blocks Mugmans combo. Mickey backs up, and sees Mugman, Cuphead and Alice in front of him. “So, if it isn’t Lions students. He’s been busy, huh? Training the next generation of sorcerers to fight his battles.”, Mickey says, engaging in banter with the trio. “Mickey, listen. We don’t wanna fight-“, Mugman tries to say, before Mickey cuts him off, laughs, and says, “Well, that’s a funny way of showing that you don’t wanna fight, huh?” Mugman frowns, and Cuphead steps up. “Whatever we do, we don’t wanna fight you. We just need some help.”, Cuphead says. “Help? Help you? Help the very institution I left? Help Lion? You all are as stubborn as he is. You kids don’t know how to make the best change in this world. Lion certainly didn’t.”, Mickey retorts, pointing out his sword. Mugman replied, “Mickey, please. Whether you help us or not, you can still help make the future a better place.” “You wanna know something very interesting? You sound JUST like him. You sound like Lion. Always thinking that there is another way. Without murder. Always talking about more options, and more chances. News Flash, Lion Jr., the world doesn’t work like that.”, Mickey said, tightening his grip on his sword. “Mickey, you once believed in changing the world, just like us. Maybe our way isn’t perfect, but it’s a start. Help us make it better.”, Mugman said. Mickey lowered his sword, and looked at Mugman. “I’m not promising anything, but I guess I’ll hear you guys out.”, Mickey said. Just then, Mickey coughed up some blood. Mickey then fell to one knee. “Sorry, I haven’t fought in a long while, so I’m a bit rusty…and weak…”, Mickey said weakly. “Oh, wait, here.”, Mugman said, finally letting his guard down and healing Mickey. Mickey is then healed back to full health and energy. “Thanks…”, Mickey said. “Hey…do you remember how I said I’d hear you out?”, Mickey asked with one eye open. Mugman looked at Mickey with a little confusion. Suddenly, within the blink of an eye, Mugman feels him arm fall of, followed by the COMPLETE ANNIHILATION OF THE BUILDING, AND LEAVING THE RUBBLE TO FALL ON THE GROUP. “I lied.”, Mickey stated, before putting his sword away. “Alright, now that I’m done with the three stooges, I can-“, Mickey stated, before he felt a sword swing, and cut the rope on his sword. “You said three stooges, right? Larry, Curly and Moe. Well, there was actually four. You just forgot the last one.”, Bendy said, holding his and Bendys sword. “Shemp.”, Bendy added. “Huh. It’s not often that I get to wipe the floor with jujutsu sorcerers. Let alone, three. So four should break my record.”, Mickey said, pulling out an alternate version of EWF. “You talk a lot. You kiss your mother with that mouth?”, Bendy said, preparing both swords. Mickey retorted, saying, “I killed my mother seven years ago.”, before he gets into his stance. “Yeesh, mommy issues, huh?”, Bendy asked. “I feel ya there.”, Bendy continued.","output":"Mickey was taken aback for a moment, a flicker of something undefinable crossing his cold features, but it vanished as quickly as it appeared, replaced by a sneer. \\"Enough talk. Let\'s see if Lion\'s teachings bear fruit.\\" Bendy, cool and composed, circled Mickey, swords poised and ready. The clash that ensued was intense, with Bendy employing swift, calculated strikes against Mickey, who met each with skill honed by years of isolation and self-imposed training. Their battle tore through what remained of the abandoned factory, each combatant pushing the other to their limits. Mickey was quick, but Bendy was resourceful, using his surroundings to his advantage, converting detritus into weapons with fluid movements. As they fought, Mickey began to notice the gap between what he\'d become and the ideals he\'d once held dear. The relentless attacks from Bendy weren\'t just physical—they were reminders of the path he\'d strayed from, a path he\'d shared with Lion and, by extension, these new sorcerers who still believed in a better world. As the dust settled from their frenetic encounter, Mickey stood, breathing heavily, a mix of exhaustion and a dawning realization washing over him. \\"You... all of you... you still believe.\\" His voice was quieter now, less certain of the choices he\'d made. Bendy lowered his weapons, eyeing Mickey cautiously but with a glimmer of understanding. \\"We believe in a better future, Mickey. It\'s not too late for you to be a part of that.\\" In the rubble, Cuphead, Alice, and Mugman began to stir, their injuries healing slowly. They watched, wondering if this confrontation would end in violence or reconciliation. Mickey looked at them, then at Bendy. For the first time in years, the heavy veil of bitterness and regret began to lift. \\"A better future, huh?\\" He smiled, though it was pained, full of complexities. \\"Maybe... maybe I do miss believing in something. Maybe I\'m tired of fighting alone.\\" The group\'s wary anticipation turned into cautious optimism. Mickey\'s stance softened, his sword lowering as he looked at each of them. \\"Alright. Tell me about this mission of yours. Tell me about this... better future.\\" As Mickey joined the group, not as an enemy but as a tentative ally, they all knew the road ahead would be fraught with challenges. But they also knew that change—true change—wasn\'t wrought from isolation and anger but from unity, understanding, and the shared belief in a future worth fighting for. Together, they left the remnants of the battle behind, stepping into the uncertain but hopeful light of dawn, ready to face whatever came next, as comrades with a common goal. The road ahead would not be easy, but with every step, they were rewriting their destinies, fighting not just for survival, but for a world where sorcerers and non-sorcerers alike could live without fear."},{"instruction":"как установить torch","output":"Установка библиотеки PyTorch в вашу Python среду может быть выполнена с помощью пакетного менеджера pip или conda в зависимости от предпочтений установки пакетов в вашей среде разработки.

Просто убедитесь, что вы работаете в среде Jupyter Notebook или JupyterLab. # Установка с использованием conda Если вы предпочитаете использовать conda для управления пакетами, выполните следующую команду: ```sh conda install -c conda-forge tqdm ``` Это установит `tqdm` из канала conda-forge, который также поддерживает использование в Jupyter Notebooks. # Использование в Jupyter Notebook Чтобы использовать `tqdm.notebook` в Jupyter Notebook, сначала импортируйте его так: ```python from tqdm.notebook import tqdm ``` Затем вы можете использовать `tqdm` в циклах для отображения прогресс-баров: ```python for i in tqdm(range(100)): # Ваш код ``` # Примечания - Убедитесь, что у вас включены виджеты IPython/Jupyter. Для jupyter notebook это может потребовать дополнительной установки виджетов: ```sh pip install ipywidgets jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension ``` - Для JupyterLab, кроме установки `ipywidgets`, может потребоваться установить поддержку виджетов jupyterlab. Она осуществляется через установку расширений. Для получения актуальной информации проверьте документацию JupyterLab. После установки и подключения `tqdm` вы получите красиво анимированные прогресс-бары при выполнении циклов в ваших Jupyter Notebooks, которые могут быть полезны при отладке и оценке продолжительности выполнения кода."},{"instruction":"как исправить UserWarning: `huggingface_hub` cache-system uses symlinks by default to efficiently store duplicated files but your machine does not support them","output":"Это предупреждение генерируется библиотекой `huggingface_hub`, когда ваша система не поддерживает символические ссылки и, как следствие, не может использовать оптимальный механизм кеширования для хранения дублирующихся файлов. Это может происходить в некоторых настроенных средах или на определённых операционных системах, например, на Windows, если конкретные условия не соблюдаются. Вот несколько способов, которые могут помочь вам устранить эту проблему или снизить её влияние: # 1. Запуск с правами администратора или использование WSL на Windows Если вы используете Windows, убедитесь, что ваше приложение или командная строка запущены с правами администратора. Это может предоставить необходимые разрешения для создания символических ссылок. Если это не возможно или не помогает, вы можете также рассмотреть использование Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), которая обеспечивает более линукс-подобное окружение на вашей машине и должна поддерживать символические ссылки без дополнительной настройки. # 2. Отключение использования символических ссылок в `huggingface_hub` В документации `huggingface_hub` на момент написания ответа не описан явный способ отключения использования символических ссылок через API. Однако, есть несколько подходов, которые могли бы теоретически помочь в обходе этой проблемы: - **Изменение исходного кода**: Если это возможно, измените код, использующий `huggingface_hub`, так, чтобы явно не использовать кеширование или переопределить механизм кеширования в библиотеке. Это довольно радикальный метод и возможен не для всех пользователей. - **Контактировать с разработчиками**: Рассмотрите возможность создания issue в репозитории `huggingface_hub` на GitHub с просьбой добавить опцию для отключения использования символических ссылок или предложение для решения этой проблемы. # 3. Обновление `huggingface_hub` Убедитесь, что вы используете последнюю версию `huggingface_hub`. Разработчики постоянно улучшают свои библиотеки, и возможно, эта проблема уже была решена в новой версии: ```sh pip install --upgrade huggingface_hub ``` # 4. Проверить настройки файловой системы Если вы опытный пользователь, убедитесь, что ваша файловая система и операционная система настроены на поддержку символических ссылок. На некоторых файловых системах, как NTFS в Windows, есть определенные ограничения или требуются специальные разрешения. Эти решения могут помочь минимизировать проблему с предупреждением. Однако, без контекста вашей конкретной ситуации трудно предложить точное решение. Важно также помнить, что даже при появлении этого предупреждения, основная функциональность библиотеки должна продолжать работать; проблема заключается в неоптимальном использовании дискового пространства из-за дублирования файлов."},{"instruction":"RuntimeError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[32], line 1 ----> 1 tokenized_ds = ds.map(tokenize_and_align_labels, batched=True, remove_columns=[\\"tokens\\", \\"id\\", \\"ner_tags\\"]) File ~/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/datasets/dataset_dict.py:868, in DatasetDict.map(self, function, with_indices, with_rank, input_columns, batched, batch_size, drop_last_batch, remove_columns, keep_in_memory, load_from_cache_file, cache_file_names, writer_batch_size, features, disable_nullable, fn_kwargs, num_proc, desc) 865 if cache_file_names is None: 866 cache_file_names = {k: None for k in self} 867 return DatasetDict( --> 868 { 869 k: dataset.map( 870 function=function, 871 with_indices=with_indices, 872 with_rank=with_rank, 873 input_columns=input_columns, 874 batched=batched, 875 batch_size=batch_size, 876 drop_last_batch=drop_last_batch, 877 remove_columns=remove_columns, 878 keep_in_memory=keep_in_memory, 879 load_from_cache_file=load_from_cache_file, 880 cache_file_name=cache_file_names[k], 881 writer_batch_size=writer_batch_size, 882 features=features, 883 disable_nullable=disable_nullable, ... 328 ) 329 elif config.TF_AVAILABLE and \\"tensorflow\\" in sys.modules and isinstance(obj, tf.Tensor): 330 if obj.ndim == 0: RuntimeError: Numpy is not available","output":"Ошибка `RuntimeError: Numpy is not available` указывает на то, что в вашей рабочей среде отсутствует библиотека NumPy, несмотря на то, что она необходима для выполнения операции.

Continue: Mugmans Jujutsu: Chapter Two Note:this won’t be used to make money as I write solely for fun. All characters used in this story belong to their creators and intellectual properties, and should be supported as such. Characters from Cuphead, Bendy and the Ink Machine, and many other possible character from other franchises might pop up, and they belong to their respective franchises, so again, I ask you to support the creators of the characters. In other words, this is fan fiction, don’t freak out. We open in on Mugman sleeping, but then he hears his alarm go off. “My name is Mugman Grace, and I’m a jujutsu sorcerer.”, He narrates, while we see Mugmans daily routine play in the background. “What? Too much. Okay, well, let’s take it from the top.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we rewind to flashbacks of Chapter One. We see Mugman eating the “pickle”, Mugman fighting Bendy, and Mugman about to activate his domain. “A few months ago, I ate a special grade cursed object, which incarnated inside me, and turned me into a vessel for the king of curses, Jules. After that, I was set up for a secret execution, but only after I ate all of Jules, which would take a while. After that, I became a jujutsu sorcerer. And for the past three months, I’ve been a grade 2 sorcerer. So far I’ve consumed nine out of twenty fingers, so I have about 11 fingers left to eat. Or, I’d say about another three months left to live. But I’ll make it worth it by making the world a better place. Lemme introduce you to my squad.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we see Mugman eat breakfast. An image appears of Cuphead, before Mugman introduces Cuphead. “This is my brother, Cuphead. He’s a grade two sorcerer, and his cursed technique allows him to…do stuff with robots or something, I honestly forgot because he doesn’t show it off much.” Then, an image of Bendy lands on Cupheads picture. “This is Bendy. He’s my friend, and a grade four sorcerer, so he’s pretty tough. His cursed technique allows him to command people or objects to do stuff by saying words from the English vocabulary.”, Mugman says, before an image of Lion lands on top of the picture of Bendy and Cuphead. “And this is my teacher, or sensei, Lion. His cursed technique allows him to channel his cursed energy into certain parts of his body, and protect it or reinforce it. It can also double the damage he does.”, Lion says. “And my cursed technique…is pretty hard to explain, so I’ll try my best.”, Mugman says, before a presentation appears. Mugman appears in a teacher outfit with glasses, and adjusts them before he turns on the presentation. “My cursed technique has three functions: Dismantle, Cleave and Erase. Dismantle is one big clean cut. Cleave is like a grid of slices, and they basically chop up my opponent into pieces. And Erase…erases the space-like, LITERAL space-in front of me, and it makes me dash pretty fast. Unfortunately, this last one I don’t use too much, so, it doesn’t have much use.”, Mugman explains. “Yes, rag doll number seventy eight in the back?”, Mugman says, pointing out into a class full of training dummies. “Are you gonna talk about cursed tools, domain expansions, and cursed energy?”, the dummy says, obviously being controlled by Mugman. “Oh, yeah. Uhh, not now, but when we come to those, we’ll explain it. Now, are we all up to speed? Good! Now, I gotta get back to eating, cause today’s a mission. And my partner is my brother. You’ve all met him, I’m sure.”, Mugman says, before we cut back to him putting on his uniform. “Hey, Mugman? You done yet? I’ve been waiting for like, twenty minutes.”, Cuphead says, leaning against Mugmans door. “Yeah, I’m coming, Cuphead.”, Mugman says, before he grabs EWF( Earth, Wind and Fire. Mugmans cursed tool infused with cursed energy. It’s a double sided combat knife), and walks out his door. “C’mon.”, Cuphead says, and they walk out, and head towards heir mission. A hour later, they arrive. “So, Cuphead? What’s the deal here?”Mugman asked, looking at the old office building. “Same as always, Mug.”, Cuphead said disinterested. “Cursed Spirit sightings and possible location of Jules finger?”, Mugman asked, letting out a sigh of tiredness. “Right on the money, Mug.”, Cuphead said. “I don’t know why we have to deal with the grade four curses…”, Mugman said mopingly. “Me too, but you don’t see me crying. Now come on, Mugman. We got a finger for you to eat.”, Cuphead said, before he headed inside. They walked through the halls, while Mugman was staring at his phone, watching TikTok. They turn a corner, and see a grade four curse. “It’s not the one we’re looking for.”, Cuphead said casually, walking towards it. Mugman, still looking down at his phone, sliced through it with ease, and kept walking. “Hey, Cuphead? After this, can we get McDonalds?”, Mugman asked, looking at Cuphead. “Didn’t you JUST eat breakfast, Mugman?”, Cuphead asked, annoyed. At the same time, a grade three spirit lunged at Cuphead from behind. “12:00 o’clock, Cuphead.”, Mugman said casually. Cuphead, without even looking away from Mugman, smashed the cursed spirit into pieces with one hand. “Also, yeah, but I want a McDonalds biscuit. Oh, and a cookie!”, Mugman said. Cuphead decided for a moment, and answered, “Fine with me, but you gotta talk to Lion about that.”, Cuphead said. “You know how he is when you eat out without him, Mug.”, Cuphead added. “Alright.”, Mugman agreed. And so, they kept walking. They eventually reached the main part of the office, and they found the finger, just sitting in the middle of the room, all alone. “It’s a trap.”, Cuphead said. “Oh, really, Captain Obvious? And what made it apparent that this is a trap?”, Mugman said sarcastically. “Fine then. Be that way.”, Cuphead said, walking over to the finger. “You literally just said that it’s a trap, and you still go for it? Are you stupid?”, Mugman asked. “No, I’m strong. That’s why.”, Cuphead said, crouching down to grab the finger. But as he touched the finger, he felt plastic. “It’s a dud.”, Cuphead said, before a grade four cursed spirit crashed from the wall above, lunging down on Cuphead. Cuphead dashed back, as he saw the cursed spirit laugh at the two for taking the bait. “Okay, you’re strong, but you’re not smart.”, Mugman said casually. “Let’s just exorcise this thing already.”, Cuphead said, annoyed at Mugman. “I was hoping you’d say that.”, Mugman said, before the two dashed and disappeared. Mugman appeared behind the cursed spirit, and hit him with a Cleave. He then kicked the spirit into Cuphead, who used his technique to capture the spirit. However, the spirit used its technique, and phased through the cage Cuphead had made. Mugman used Erase and dashed toward the cursed spirit, sending it out the window. He then dashed down, and took out EWF, and tried to cut off the cursed spirits head. However, he made EWF phase through Mugmans hand, and unphased it at the perfect time to cut off Mugmans hand. Mugman let go of the cursed spirit and used Reverse Cursed Technique to heal and regenerate his hand. Cuphead jumped down as well, and grabbed Mugmans hands. He then quickly scan Mugman and threw him down to kick the cursed spirit again. This time, Mugman made a donut out of the cursed spirit, putting a hole through the spirit. Mugman landed on the ground firmly, and dashed away, careful not to get crushed under the cursed spirit. Meanwhile, Cuphead, still falling with the cursed spirit, he created a whip out of the falling debris, and sent cursed energy through the rope, and hit the spirit the exact time the cursed energy had reached the end of the rope and hit the spirit, creating a Black Flash. The monster was smashed into the ground, and Cuphead landed easily. “Is it over?”, Mugman asked. Then, the spirit began to get back up, healing the donut hole in its belly. “Nope.”, Cuphead said. Mugman then began to think on how to defeat this thing. If his duo attack didn’t work, he might have to use his domain expansion, but he can’t use it while Cupheads around. So, Mugman made a risky move. “I’ll take it on myself, you go and get Bendy.”, Mugman said, dead serious. “Mugman,you’re joking. There is no way in heaven or hell you’re taking on this thing.”, Cuphead said. “Exactly, I’m just buying some time. Go. Get. Bendy.”, Mugman said. Cuphead quickly left. “Alright, cursed spirit. It’s time to exorcise you.”, Mugman said. Mugman stood firmly, and put out his hands, focusing his energy while doing so. “Domain Expansion…”, Mugman said carefully. But as Mugman was about to finish the domain expansion, he saw the cursed spirit was about to unleash its own domain expansion. “Alright, then!”, Mugman said, smirking. “RIGID COFFIN OF THE DEVIL HIMSELF!”, Mugman said, as his domain began to shape, clashing with the cursed spirits domain expansion, “The Cobweb of Asinine Angels.” Mugman hits the sprit with a dismantle, sending a line of lava the spirits way, but the spirit blocks it with a chain from his domain. Then, the cursed spirit sends out his hands, also sending two chains at Mugman. Mugman dodges him, and tries to hit the cursed spirit with a Cleave. The spirit attempts to block it, but is still hit. The spirit then begins to regenerate, as he starts raising more chains to try and attack Mugman with. Meanwhile, Mugman is panicking, trying to make his domain stable, since it’s running out of energy. Mugman prepares one final attack, but it’s one he hasn’t used before. “Cursed Energy Charge: Red.”, Mugman says, holding out his hand like a gun. A ball made of pure cursed energy begins to form at the tip of Mugmans finger, and then Mugman says, “Blast.” The blast is blasted, and the cursed spirit is destroyed, leaving only the finger. Mugman lets go of his domain, and he falls to the floor. But before he passes out, he grabs the finger, and he gulps it down. Then, Mugman passes out. Mugman wakes up in his dorm, feeling burnt out. Mugman looks around, and sees Bendy at his side, waiting for him to wake up. Bendy looks back at Mugman, to see that he’s awake. “Mugman, you alright? You managed to defeat a special grade curse. So I’m guessing that you aren’t.”, Bendy says, seemingly tired. “Wait…that was a special grade…? But I thought it was-“, Mugman asked, before Bendy cut him off, stating, “Grade four? When normal, weak curses usually around grade four or three eat a special grade object, they usually get infused with that cursed objects power. That’s why it was so strong.”, Bendy said. “Wow…how do you know that…?”, Mugman asked, staring at the ceiling. “It’s common knowledge among sorcerers, Mug.”, Bendy said. But, he was actually just reading from a book about curses. “Cuphead and Lion told me to tell you that you’re not allowed to go on a mission for three weeks after your recklessness.”, Bendy said. “What…?! But I got rid of the special-grade…! I should be…like…promoted…! You can get promoted in jujutsu sorcery, right…?”, Mugman asked, sad. “Well, it’s not like jail, Mug. You can’t beat up the biggest, baddest, toughest guy and expect to be the strongest. It’s not like that. You gotta earn it by first taking down small fry. So, your on downtime for three weeks. Think of it like…vacation, Mug.”, Bendy said, getting up, and leaving. “Oh, yeah. One more thing. Lion told me that you should focus your downtime on training, since you have yet to actually train.”, Bendy said, before leaving Mugmans room. Mugman laid there for a few seconds, before getting off the side of his bed. “A special-grade curse, huh? Gotta say, Mug-brat, I’m impressed. Maybe you’ll actually have a chance to beat me once I leave your body. Or, take control. Either way, I’ll win in the end.”, Jules said, with one of the mini mouths on Mugman. “Is all you do just hype yourself, Jules? You cannot go a day without glazing yourself, can you?”, Mugman said, annoyed. “Hey, I was the greatest sorcerer in history. If I can hype myself, who can?”, Jules said smugggishly. “Oh, I don’t know, maybe people you actually let leave ALIVE.”, Mugman said, as he began to put on his uniform. “Mug-brat, are you deaf? Your classmate said that you’re on break, so what’s the reason for the suit?”, Jules asked confused, but still smug. “He can’t tell me what to do, so I’m gonna go talk to the king of the jungle.”, Mugman said, putting on his shoes. “Right here, pal.”, Jules said, before laughing. “I’m talking about Lion, you Agamemnon.”, Mugman said, before he whacked Jules mouth. “Yeesh. Tough crowd.”, Jules replied, before his mouth disappeared. Mugman began to walk towards lions office, both angry and scared about the conversation ahead. He walked into lions office. “Hey, Mug, what’s up?”, Lion said, filing some paperwork. “Um, Lion, I wanted to talk to you about my three weeks off.”, Mugman said. “Alright, spit.”, Lion said, preparing to listen. “So, I know that I was reckless, and I took on a special grade spirit-and won, by the way-, and almost died, and I gotta recover properly, but I gotta get back out there. I mean, I probably have three, or, if we find them quickly, 2 months left to live! I don’t wanna spend even SOME of that time just sitting around, throwing a ball at a wall! I wanna make a difference, and change the world, make it better for people, and for those people’s children, and for those children’s children!”, Mugman argued. “I see…”, Lion said. “Before I die, I wanna help people, make a change! Like you! Your a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help! I find that very, very confusing, Lion! So, please! Let me help! I’m string, and you could do it with me!”, Mugman argued again. “…Mugman.”, Lion began. “Do you like stories?”, Lion asked. “Uh, yeah…? But, what’s that have to do with-“, Mugman asked, before Lion cut him off. “Let me tell you a story, then, Mugman. A story about a young sorcerer, who wanted to change the world.”, Lion said. We cut to 2007, in Japan. We see two young sorcerers walking down the street. “So, what are we clowning around for, Lion”? The other sorcerer said. We then see a young, second grade sorcerer Lion walking down the street, drinking water. “What teach’ told us to do, Mickey. Just get rid of some of the cursed spirits in the area.”, Lion said to his best friend, Mickey. “This is so stupid. I say we just get rid of the people in the area, then boom, no cursed sprints in the area.”, Mickey said annoyed. “Yeah, well, we’re not like the police or something.”, Lion said, drinking from his water bottle. “Yeah, because we’re something better-Jujutsu sorcerers.”, Mickey said. “Wanna hit the arcade after this to make you feel better, BaAaBy?”, Lion said, treating Mickey like a cranky toddler. “Shut up, Lion. But fine.”, Mickey said, groaning. “Cool.”, Lion said, throwing his water bottle in the air, and then evaporating it. “Alright. We’re here.”, Mickey said, standing up straight. “Alright, let’s kick some cursed butt.”, Lion said, before walking in. “Yeah, what you said.”, Mickey said tiredly, before following behind. Lion takes care of a grade four curse, and Mickey turns it into a ball, and swallows it. “Blech. It’s so gross that it almost makes you laugh.”, Mickey said, rubbing his throat. “But it’s worth it, cause then you can-“, Lion said, before Lion and Mickey said, “Control the curse and make it fight.”, at the same time. “Yeah, I know, Lion. But they taste disgusting.”, Mickey said. “They taste like literal trash.”, Mickey added. “Well, they’re pure negativity, so maybe that’s the reason.”, Lion said jokingly. “Well, maybe we need to get rid of the source of the negativity.”, Mickey said. “…you know we can’t kill non-sorcerers, Mick. That’s wrong.”, Lion said, now serious. “You have to make two wrongs to make a right, Right?”, Mickey said, now facing Lion. “Sometimes two wrongs can make three wrongs, Mick.”, Lion said. “It would be the easiest way. They don’t have any curse energy, let alone a technique. So, why can’t we get rid of the people that make the curses? Why can’t we get rid of the source of the problem?”, Mickey said, now angry. “Cause it’s not right. If we kill all non-sorcerers, jujutsu wouldn’t exist, the world would end, and eventually, we would become the humans, and curses would still linger.”, Lion said. “It would still be better with no people. You could do it Lion.”, Mickey said. “You could get rid of all non-sorcerers. You could make the world a better place. You could help save the world from the evil that lives, breathes, eats, rids on the world. Non-sorcerers.”, Mickey explained. “Mickey, it just isn’t right.”, Lion said. “Are you strong because your Lion? Or are you Lion because you’re strong?”, Mickey asked. “What are you trying to say?”, Lion asked. “I’m asking if your strength defines who you are. Because it doesn’t. One day, Lion. I’ll make the world a better place, I just have to make it.”, Mickey explained. “I wanna help people. I wanna make a change. Like you. You’re a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help. I find that very, very confusing, Lion. So, please. Let me help. I’m strong, and you could do it with me.”, Mickey asked. “Help me eliminate all non-sorcerers.”, Mickey asked again. A moment of silence fell upon the two, before Lion replied, saying, “Killing innocent people, regardless of whether they’re sorcerers or not, doesn’t solve the root problem. It only perpetuates a cycle of hatred and fear. We have to be better. We have to find another way. I’m sorry, Mickey, I can’t. I just can’t. My hands are tied, and you don’t see your error.”, Lion said. “Fine then. If you don’t stand by me, you stand in front of me. You’re in my way.”, Mickey said, beginning to ready his Cursed Technique to fight. “Mickey, please. You’re my friend. I don’t wanna fight you.”, Lion said, preparing his cursed technique for defense, not wanting to hurt Mickey. “I wouldn’t wanna fight me either.”, Mickey said, before sending out a grade three curse at Lion. Lion dodged, and tried to reason with Mickey. “Mickey, come on! This isn’t you.”, Lion said, outrunning the curse chasing him. “You’re right, Lion. This isn’t me. This is the new me.”, Mickey said, and with a swift motion of his hand, the curse swept Lion into a wall. Lion used his cursed technique to reinforce his body in order to not take damage. “Mickey, listen to what you’re saying. You want to kill innocent people to make a better place.”, Lion said, dashing towards Mickey, preparing to disarm him. “You have to get rid of non-innocents to make innocents.”, Mickey said. Lion jumped up, and prepared to kick Mickey. But just about when he was gonna kick, he stopped. “Mickey, please. I’m your friend. Let me help.”, Lion said, holding onto Mickeys shoulder. “I don’t need any help.”, Mickey said, brushing off lions hand. “And I’m not your friend.”, Mickey said, before Mickey left, not just the building. But lions friendship. The jujutsu high school. We then cut back to present day. “It’s been five years ever since that day occurred.”, Lion said, tears running down his face. “Your room…it was Mickeys. It was ours.”, Lion said. “So, what happened to Mickey…?”, Mugman asked, feeling a lump grow in his throat. “I don’t know. I haven’t seen him since.”, Lion said. “I tell you this, Mugman, so that you learn that your strength does not define who you are, it does not define the world. Your choices define what you are. And what you do.”, Lion said, now crying. “I…I understand, sensei.”, Mugman said, now also tearing up. “During these three weeks…can you teach me all you know?”, Mugman asked. “I’d be happy to, Mugman.”, Lion said, putting down his pen. And so, Mugman trained relentlessly. And then his suspension was up. We cut to three weeks later, with Mugman, Bendy, and Cuphead heading to Kanto, to go and recruit another sorcerer from their sister school. “So, who are we picking up?”, Mugman asked, while playing Flappy Bird on his phone. “Alice.”, Cuphead said, looking out of the window. “Oh. Does she have a cursed technique?”, Mugman asked. “Yeah, obviously, Mugman.”, Cuphead replied. “What is it?”, Mugman asked. “It’d be too good to spoil you, Mugman. But just know this: When she gets worked up…her power is comparable to Jules.”, Bendy said. “Whaaaat? You’re lying.”, Mugman said, not believing Bendy. “Trust me, Mugman.”, Bendy said. Then, the train stops, and the location says that they’ve arrived in Kanto. “Alright, let’s go to our sister school.”, Cuphead said, leading the group. “How is it that you’re a grade two sorcerer leading the group, but I’m a grade THREE sorcerer being led by a lower class?”, Bendy said frustrated. “Dunno, don’t care.”, Cuphead said. Eventually, after about an hour of walking, they arrive at their sister school. Cuphead and his gang walk in, and check in with this schools principal/sensei. They then go to Alice’s room. Mugman knocks on the door. “Ugh, who is it?”, a voice said from inside the room. “Chicka-chicka boom boom.”, Bendy said out of nowhere. Suddenly, the room got quiet, and Alice opened the door. “Bendy?”, Alice asked. “Hey, you remembered the signal!”, Bendy said happily. “And uh…who are these losers?”, Alice asked, whispering to Bendy. “Oh, there with me. We need to recruit you for a mission.”, Bendy whispered back. “Oh.”, Alice said. Alice stepped back, and looked at Mugman and Cuphead. “And you guys are…?”, Alice asked. Mugman raised his hand, and introduced himself. “Hi! I’m Mugman, Grade Two sorcerer!”, Mugman said happily. “Nice to meet you.”, Mugman added, extending his hand. Alice then glared at Cuphead. “I’m Cuphead.”, Cuphead said, looking away. Alice stared at the two for a minute. “This…’Mugman’ guy looks weird. Definitely the kid that ate his own boogers. Does he even have a cursed technique? And Cuphead thinks that he’s the GOAT, by just telling me his name.”, Alice thought. “Why am I always stuck with the weird ones.”, Alice said, sighing. “We need you cause your ‘apparently’, pretty strong.”, Mugman said, with skepticism and sarcasm in his voice. Alice gritted her teeth at Mugman. “And what’s that supposed to mean, you little narc?”, Alice said, angry. “What I’m saying is that I don’t believe that you’re that tough that you could rival Jules in power. I mean…”, Mugman says, about to say something to set Alice off. “…you’re a girl!”, Mugman said. Alice’s top blew off. “Alright then, dippy. Let’s spar right here, right now. “Okay.”, Mugman said. Alice and Mugman then head out into the field. Mugman stands still,e doe ting Alice to be on the level of a grade one sorcerer. Alice ready her stance. “Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey.”, Alice states, before a pair of die appear before Alice. Alice then pulls out one of her weapons, and places it down. “Bet one of your items, or anything that you have.”, Alice said. Mugman, underestimating her, places down EWF. Suddenly, both of their items are sucked into the dice, and Alice pockets the dice. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off.”, Alice said, activating her domain expansion. Suddenly, a black dome surrounds the two, and the two are placed in a card game of War. “What the? Why are we playing War?”, Mugman thought. Mugman dashed to get up and attack Alice, but was quickly placed back down into the chair. “Ah, ah, ah.”, Alice said, waving her finger. “You already made a bet. Now you have to play the game.”, Alice said. Suddenly, Mugmans mind was filled with the rules of her technique. Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey When this Cursed Technique activates, it summons a pair of die. After the die are summoned, the two people fighting are forced to put one thing they have on a “bet”, that if either of them lose the “bet”, that object or anything that they had bet is destroyed beyond repair. When both players have placed their “bets”, the person with this cursed technique (gamblers monkey), activates their Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off, which puts the opponent and the other opponent either in a boxing arena, a game of cards (can be blackjack, poker or war), or puts them back at the betting stage to bet one more item. If either of them lose any of the challenges or refuses to put down something to bet, that person, along with their item(or items that they betted), are eradicated. If either of the players lose in one of the battles, they, and their betted item, are eradicated. The Domain Expansion for this cursed technique is automatic, and does not require cursed energy to activate or form. “Woah, this is how the game functions, huh?”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “Yup, glad that I gave you the rules, huh?”, Alice said with a smirk. “Sure.”, Mugman said, before he drew a card, and they both began to play the game. As they were playing the game, Mugman thought about how unique her technique was. It wasn’t one made for fighting, it was made for gambling, Which he thought was honestly pretty cool. It’s not everyday that you get to see cursed techniques like this, let alone, cursed techniques that aren’t inherited or copied. Mugman put down a card, and with that swift motion, Mugman won the game. The domain dissipates, and the pair of die fly out of Alice’s pocket. Suddenly, Mugmans EWF drops in front of him, while the dice holding Alice’s weapons shivers, and then cracks, and dies. Alice grits her teeth, while Mugman hold EWF in his hand, looking at its new design and material. “Woah, what happened to my weapon?”, Mugman said, asking Alice. Alice, still angry about her loss, answers Mugman, “When you win against my technique, it enhances the item or whatever you betted by tenfold.”, Alice said. “Cool!”, Mugman stated. “Alice…”, Mugman began to ask. “I want to gamble again.”, Mugman asked. Alice looked up. “Half of my lifespan, if I lose, goes away. If I win, my cursed energy is increased by tenfold, and remains that way from now on.”, Mugman said. “MUGMAN, ARE YOU CRAZY?! YOU DONT WANNA BET LIKE THAT, THATS TOO RISKY!”, Bendy yelled. Alice grinned. “THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO SEE! I LIKE TO SEE HIGH STAKES!”, Alice yelled with a grin. “I accept your bet, Mugman. If I win, I get half of your remaining lifespan, but if I lose, the cursed energy that you receive that multiplies your cursed energy tenfold will be my own cursed energy!”, Alice yelled. Mugman also grinned. “Let’s do it!”, he yelled. Alice threw out the die once more, and the die absorbed Mugmans cursed energy, and half of his life. The other die absorbed Alice’s Cursed energy. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off!”, Alice yelled. A black dome surrounded the two, and the two were placed into a boxing ring. “This is it, Mugman. This is the coin toss that decides our fate. Let’s hope that we win.”, Alice said, grinning. “Good luck.”, Mugman said, getting into a boxing stance. “I don’t need luck. I’m full of it.”, Alice said, starting off the boxing match with a right hook, followed by a jab to the stomach. Mugman blocks the right hook, but is punched in his gut. Mugman retaliates with 3 right jabs, followed by a left hook, and three right jabs, all to the face. Alice blocked the last few, after being hit by the first few. Alice tried to juke Mugman by winding up a left hook, only to throw a right jab. Mugman didn’t fall for it though, dodging the right jab, before mollywhopping Alice in the face, sending her into the ropes of the ring. Alice relaxed for a minute, before pushing back on the ropes, sending herself flying into Mugman. Alice threw a flurry of punches at Mugman, with some landing, and some being blocked. Mugman threw a right hook at the same time Alice also threw a right hook, leaving them at a temporary standstill. “You’re good. You’ve been practicing?”, Alice asked sarcastically. “You know, I’m something of an athlete myself.”, Mugman answered, before following a jab that lasted for 0.01 seconds. Alice was sent back by the jab, both surprised and injured. Alice let herself fall down to avoid another jab by Mugman, before catching her self, and pushing herself back up to land a left hook on Mugman. Mugman was sent back, but caught himself on the rings ropes. Mugman dodged a punch to the face, and rapidly punched Alice in the stomach, before landing on uppercut. Alice fell down, but quickly got up to avoid losing. “I gotta dodge his punches for a while, until I can regain my stamina.”, Alice thought, dodging a jab from Mugman. Mugman slowed his jabs, trying to predict where she would dodge. But as Mugman tried to land another punch, he reimbursed the words of his sensei. “Don’t let your strength define you. Let your choices define who you are.”, Mugman thought, imaging his sensei fighting by his side. Mugman landed multiple punches and labs on Alice, and with landing the final blow, Alice was done. But, as Alice accepted her defeat, she felt something catch her by the collar. It was Mugman. “Stand still for ten seconds.”, Mugman instructed. Alice, in a daze, didn’t answer, but just stood there. Mugman walked over to one of the corners of the ring, and began to smash his head in. “He…he’s…he’s trying to initiate a tie…”, Alice thought, as she felt her legs become numb. And with the last blow to Mugmans head, both of the contestants fell to the floor, bruised and battered. The domain fell, and the two received their betted items back, not enhanced. Mugman used his Reversed Cursed Technique to heal his injuries, with Alice doing the same. “Why?”, Alice asked. “You had me on the final thread. Why give it up? Why give up ten times the energy you have now? Why give up the best statistics in jujutsu history?”, Alice asked, genuinely curious. “A wise person once told me that your strength doesn’t define who you are. It’s your choices. My strength is defined by my choices, and my choices defined me. I know what power can do to a person. It isn’t pretty. I didn’t want either of us to become absorbed by power, and do something risky that might chance the future maybe fifty, or a hundred years later. The future I want to make is the future that will become. A better world.”, Mugman said. Alice got up, dusting herself off. “Most sorcerers I know would’ve taken that chance and stomped my face in. But…you’re different. You’re the most respectable sorcerer I know now.”, Alice said, extending out her hand this time. “I’m Alice. Special Grade Sorcerer.”, Alice said with a smile on her face. Mugman shook her hand. “Mugman Grace, Second Grade Sorcerer.”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “So…uh…how did it go…?”, Bendy asked, looking at the two worried that one of them won. “It was a tie. And Alice is coming along with us.”, Mugman said. Alice confirmed, saying, “True dat.” “Alright, well, let’s head back to Tokyo. Our sensei is waiting to give us our next mission.”, Cuphead said, eating a chocolate stick. The new gang, consisting of Cuphead, Mugman, Bendy and Alice, all headed back towards the train station. We then cut to Tokyo, five hours later. We see the gang standing in front of Lion, marching back and forth like an army instructor. “Alright, guys. Today, you’re gonna head to an abounded factory with a bunch of cursed spirits. Two things: One, this might be a possible location of Jules finger. And two…”, Lion said, before continuing. “This might be a hideout of a sorcerer that went rogue 7 years ago. So, be on the lookout.”, Lion said. Most of the group just shrugged it off, but Mugman didn’t. Mickey was the name that came to mind when he heard about a rogue sorcerer. “We got it, sensei.”, they all said in unison. And with that, they set off. 4 hours later, they arrive. “Alright, here’s the plan. Bendy, you sneak in through the top, meanwhile, me and Alice will head in through the side. Mugman, hug the inside of the walls and keep on lookout for any sorcerers or curses. Got it, gang?”, Cuphead said. “Ahem. I believe that I’m the highest graded sorcerer, Cuphead.”, Alice said jokingly. “Shut up, Alice.”, Cuphead said. “Okay, Move out.”, Cuphead ordered, before everyone dashed so fast that they disappeared. Mugman cleared the outside, and reported, “no one outback. Red lobster, what do you see on the bottom floor with Wonder Woman?”, “Mugman, what are you talking about?”, Cuphead asked, genuinely confused. “Oh, I’m using code name! 8m Blue Jay, your Red Lobster, Alice is Wonder Woman, and Bendy is Lil’ Devil!”, Mugman said. “Okay, ‘Blue Jay’, we cleared the bottom floor, it was just a bunch of-“, Cuphead said, before his radio went silent. We see a sword go through Cupheads radio. “If I had practiced a little more, I would’ve pinned you to the wall.”, a mysterious figure said behind them. Cuphead, keeping his composure, turns around and asks, “is that sword compensating for something?” The mysterious figure smirks, and answers, “No, actually. It’s antique. old. And has a rope attached to it.”, as he pulls the sword back, cutting Cuphead on the nose. Alice then turns towards the figure. “Who even are you?”, Alice asks. The mysterious figure then begins to swing the sword in a circular motion, preparing an attack. “Why would I tell you that?”, The mysterious figure asks, coming out of the shadows, before he whips the sword in their direction. Cuphead and Alice ready their Cursed Techniques. “So that we can call you names while rubbing your face in the dirt.”, Alice says. The mysterious figure finally reveals himself to be Mickey. “Alright then. Let’s see if your sensei taught you well.”, Mickey says, before he swings his sword. Cuphead and Alice go on defense, staying back to back. Mickey then swings down from above, seemingly teleporting. “How come I can’t sense his cursed energy?”, Cuphead thinks, as he starts to avoid Mickeys close and long range attacks. Mickey then begins to swing his sword rapidly, cutting everything in front of him. “ALICE! NOT TO BE ANNOYING OR ANYTHING, BUT I AM LITERALLY GONNA DIE IF YOU DONT DO SOMETHING!”, Cuphead yelled, narrowing avoiding his head getting chopped off. Alice then summons a deck of cards, and throws them at Mickey. Mickey dashes again, this time in front of Alice. “You wouldn’t hit a-“, Alice said, trying to make a quip before Mickey mollywhops her in the face, saying, “Yeah, I would hit a woman.” Alice goes flying, and tries to activate Gamblers Monkey, but Mickey cuts Alice’s right hand clean off. Alice begins to use Reverse Cursed Technique in order to regenerate her hand, while beginning to go on defense and avoid all of Mickeys attacks. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Mugman crashes through the window. Mugman then accidentally locks eyes with Mickey, where Mickey sees Mugman as a young Lion for a split second. Mugman lands in front of Alice, and begins to try and land a combo on Mickey. Mickey quickly remembers this combo. “Oh, this is Lions. So, Lion taught these kids jujutsu, huh? Alright then. Lucky me, since he taught me these moves too. And how to counter them.”, Mickey thinks, as he blocks Mugmans combo. Mickey backs up, and sees Mugman, Cuphead and Alice in front of him. “So, if it isn’t Lions students. He’s been busy, huh? Training the next generation of sorcerers to fight his battles.”, Mickey says, engaging in banter with the trio. “Mickey, listen. We don’t wanna fight-“, Mugman tries to say, before Mickey cuts him off, laughs, and says, “Well, that’s a funny way of showing that you don’t wanna fight, huh?” Mugman frowns, and Cuphead steps up. “Whatever we do, we don’t wanna fight you. We just need some help.”, Cuphead says. “Help? Help you? Help the very institution I left? Help Lion? You all are as stubborn as he is. You kids don’t know how to make the best change in this world. Lion certainly didn’t.”, Mickey retorts, pointing out his sword. Mugman replied, “Mickey, please. Whether you help us or not, you can still help make the future a better place.” “You wanna know something very interesting? You sound JUST like him. You sound like Lion. Always thinking that there is another way. Without murder. Always talking about more options, and more chances. News Flash, Lion Jr., the world doesn’t work like that.”, Mickey said, tightening his grip on his sword. “Mickey, you once believed in changing the world, just like us. Maybe our way isn’t perfect, but it’s a start. Help us make it better.”, Mugman said. Mickey lowered his sword, and looked at Mugman. “I’m not promising anything, but I guess I’ll hear you guys out.”, Mickey said. Just then, Mickey coughed up some blood. Mickey then fell to one knee. “Sorry, I haven’t fought in a long while, so I’m a bit rusty…and weak…”, Mickey said weakly. “Oh, wait, here.”, Mugman said, finally letting his guard down and healing Mickey. Mickey is then healed back to full health and energy. “Thanks…”, Mickey said. “Hey…do you remember how I said I’d hear you out?”, Mickey asked with one eye open. Mugman looked at Mickey with a little confusion. Suddenly, within the blink of an eye, Mugman feels him arm fall of, followed by the COMPLETE ANNIHILATION OF THE BUILDING, AND LEAVING THE RUBBLE TO FALL ON THE GROUP. “I lied.”, Mickey stated, before putting his sword away. “Alright, now that I’m done with the three stooges, I can-“, Mickey stated, before he felt a sword swing, and cut the rope on his sword. “You said three stooges, right? Larry, Curly and Moe. Well, there was actually four. You just forgot the last one.”, Bendy said, holding his and Bendys sword. “Shemp.”, Bendy added. “Huh. It’s not often that I get to wipe the floor with jujutsu sorcerers. Let alone, three. So four should break my record.”, Mickey said, pulling out an alternate version of EWF. “You talk a lot. You kiss your mother with that mouth?”, Bendy said, preparing both swords. Mickey retorted, saying, “I killed my mother seven years ago.”, before he gets into his stance. “Yeesh, mommy issues, huh?”, Bendy asked. “I feel ya there.”, Bendy continued.","output":"**Please note that the current narrative exceeds the usual length and complexity that fits into a short response. Therefore, the sequel will continue directly from where it left off, narrowing the focus on the imminent confrontation between Bendy and Mickey, and finding a fulfilling yet concise resolution.** Bendy eyed Mickey, the tension thick in the air. Despite the gravity of what Mickey revealed, Bendy\'s demeanor remained unfazed, his grip on both swords tightening. Mickey, meanwhile, stood ready, an embodiment of the path diverged into darkness, a stark contrast to Bendy\'s resolve. \\"Let\'s make this quick. I have places to be,\\" Mickey taunted, the smirk barely leaving his face. Bendy laughed softly, \\"You think this is about speed? It\'s about making a point, Mickey. And I plan to make it loud and clear.\\" Without another word, the dance of blades commenced. Bendy, despite being outnumbered in terms of technique, displayed a unique agility, weaving between Mickey\'s swings with a grace that belied his form. To any onlooker, it was less a battle and more a macabre ballet, orchestrated by the clashing wills of its participants. Mickey, taken aback by Bendy\'s resilience, increased the velocity and ferocity of his attacks. However, with each swing, his frustration grew; Bendy was not just an opponent to beat—he was a mirror to Mickey\'s own lost humanity, reflecting what could have been if choices had diverged at that pivotal moment years ago. As the duel reached its crescendo, Bendy saw an opening—not merely to disarm Mickey, but to reach the remnants of the man behind the sorcerer. With a swift motion, Bendy disarmed Mickey, the sound of metal clattering to the ground echoing hauntingly in the silence that followed. Mickey stood, defeated not just in combat but in spirit, the weight of his choices pressing down on him. Bendy, panting from the exertion, did not take advantage of the moment to gloat. Instead, he offered a hand to Mickey, an olive branch extending beyond their fight. \\"This...this isn\'t about who wins or loses, Mickey. It’s about what we choose to fight for,\\" Bendy stated, his voice firm yet filled with compassion. Mickey, looking at the hand offered to him, felt a surge of emotions he had buried deep. Regret, guilt, and a faint glimmer of hope. It was a turning point, a choice laid bare before him. Taking Bendy\'s hand, Mickey allowed himself to be pulled up, a silent acknowledgment of his defeat and, more importantly, his desire to seek a path not marred by the bloodshed of his past actions. Bendy smiled, \\"Come on, let\'s get you patched up. We have a world to make better, and believe it or not, you\'re a part of that plan.\\" As they walked back toward where their friends were slowly recovering amidst the rubble, a new chapter was unfolding. One where past grievances could forge the strongest alliances, and the quest for redemption was not a solitary path but a journey made alongside those who dared to dream of a better world. The inclusion of Mickey into the fold marked not just a ceasefire but a testament to the power of change, redemption, and the undying human spirit\'s capacity for forgiveness. As they moved forward, the group of Cuphead, Mugman, Bendy, Alice, and now Mickey, stood united not only by their mutual goal but by the understanding that in the complex web of life and sorcery, it was their bonds, their choices, and their unwavering hope that defined their strength. Together, they would navigate the challenges ahead, each battle a step closer to the brighter world they envisioned—a world where the shadows of curses faded in the light of their resolve and unity."},{"instruction":"<?php function main_code(unique_id,event,nr_args,args) { event=args[0];

This structure facilitates event differentiation such as account registration (`event==1`), login (`event==2`), chat (`event==3`), and others. 2. **Data Validation:** Before processing events that require username and password (like registration and login), the code checks for the existence of the required arguments and ensures that neither the username nor the password are solely numeric values. This is likely a minimal effort to enforce some form of quality in the inputs but might not be sufficient for real-world applications, which would also require checking for other vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or other forms of injection attacks if applicable. However, as this seems to use flat files instead of a database, SQL injection is not a direct concern here, but sanitizing inputs is still a crucial practice. 3. **File System Operations:** The code heavily relies on file system operations to read, write, and check for the existence of files. It stores accounts, player data, and server variables in files. This method of data storage is simplistic and might work for small-scale or proof-of-concept applications but is not scalable or secure for larger, production-grade applications. Concurrency issues, data corruption, and security issues might arise when multiple instances of the script try to access the same file, especially without proper locking mechanisms or when used in a non-atomic manner. 4. **Security Concerns:** The method of storing passwords directly in files (as seen in the account registration and login handling) raises significant security concerns. Passwords should never be stored in plain text but should be securely hashed using a strong cryptographic hash function and, if possible, salted to protect against rainbow table attacks. 5. **Hardcoding and Magic Numbers:** The code uses hardcoded paths and magic numbers (like event type numbers and the maximum number of players). Hardcoding can make the code less flexible and harder to maintain, and using magic numbers without explanation or named constants decreases readability and maintainability. 6. **Lack of Modularization:** The code is written in a somewhat monolithic structure. For better maintainability, readability, and future expansion, it would be helpful to modularize functionalities into separate functions or classes based on purpose (e.g., authentication, player management, chat handling). 7. **Missing Function Definitions:** The code snippet references several functions (e.g., `send_data_to_player()`, `read_file()`, `write_file()`, etc.) that are not defined within the provided code. These functions are presumably defined elsewhere in the codebase. Their implementation details would be critical to fully assess the efficacy and security of the overall system. 8. **Potential Optimization:** There are certain areas in the code that could be optimized or made more efficient. For example, instead of reading files multiple times within the same request (seen in some event handling logic), it could be more efficient to read once and reuse the data. In summary, while the code snippet demonstrates basic server-side game management functionalities, several improvements are recommended, especially concerning security, scalability, and maintainability. Transitioning to a database management system, implementing proper authentication and authorization practices, and adopting a more modular code structure would be beneficial steps forward."},{"instruction":"I want to write a professional email to Amr Sameh informing him that placing the PA towers 30 meters apart is not a good solution as the venue is 50 meters wide and that will leave a gap in the middle will place the towers on the sides of the venue which leaves us with a maximum of 22 meters as an option . i want to tell him also that using a stackable array will be also high and it will cut the view as we will use platforms to stack the system on so we might as well hang the system. Placing the speakers 30 meters apart is not a recommended option as it will not deliver the desired performance and the option that we recommend is 22 meters apart using a mast that we will attach some pictures for.","output":"Subject: Reconsidering the Placement of PA Towers for Venue Sound System Dear Amr Sameh, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss the proposed placement of PA towers for the upcoming event at the venue. After careful consideration and assessment, we have determined that placing the PA towers 30 meters apart is not the most optimal solution. As the venue is only 50 meters wide, having the towers 30 meters apart would leave a significant gap in the middle, which is not ideal for ensuring an even distribution of sound. Instead, we recommend placing the towers on the sides of the venue, which would leave us with a maximum distance of 22 meters between them. Additionally, using a stackable array for the PA system might not be the most suitable option either. While it would allow for greater height, it could potentially obstruct the view for attendees, as platforms would be needed to stack the system on. In this case, hanging the system would be a more practical and visually appealing solution. Ultimately, placing the speakers 30 meters apart would not deliver the desired performance and sound quality for the event. We strongly recommend considering the option of positioning the towers 22 meters apart using a mast setup, which we have attached pictures of for reference. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns regarding these suggestions. We are committed to ensuring the best possible sound experience for the event and are more than willing to discuss further options for optimizing the PA system placement.

It handles tasks like account registration and login, chat messages, player position updates, pinging for latency checks, and sending player inventory, gold, and troops information. Each action is triggered by an `event` parameter, with additional `args` providing the necessary data for each action. The script closely interacts with the file system for storing and retrieving player data, which suggests a relatively simple or preliminary approach to game data management. Here\'s a more detailed analysis: # General Structure - **Conditional Logic**: The main function `main_code` uses a series of `if-else` statements to handle different events based on the value of the `event` variable, which is reassigned at the start of the function. This is somewhat unconventional and could lead to confusion since `event` is also a parameter of the function. - **Event Handling**: For each event, different actions are taken – from account creation and login to sending game state updates to clients. Actions are based on the event type (e.g., `1` for registration, `2` for login). # Specific Observations - **File System Dependencies**: The script heavily relies on the file system for data storage (`accounts/`, `username_id/`, `ip_login/`, `local_id/`, `players/`). This approach may lead to scalability and performance issues as the number of players increases. - **Security Concerns**: Storing passwords directly in a file without encryption or hashing is insecure. This poses a significant risk of compromising user information. - **Data Validation**: The code contains checks to ensure usernames and passwords are not purely numeric and checks for invalid characters, but the criteria for invalid characters (`check_string` function, not shown) are unclear. Modern practices would recommend more comprehensive validation and sanitation, especially to prevent injection attacks. - **Code Organization**: The script could benefit from separating concerns, such as handling different event types in dedicated functions or classes. This would improve readability and maintainability. - **Global Variables and Side Effects**: The script assumes functions like `send_data_to_player` and file manipulation functions, as well as access to a variable `allow_teleport`, without context on their implementations. It\'s essential for maintainable code to minimize side effects and unclear dependencies. - **Error Handling**: It\'s unclear how errors or exceptions are handled, especially concerning file operations and network communication. Robust error handling would be vital for a stable game server. - **Performance Implications**: Using the file system for real-time features, such as chat and position updates, may not be the most efficient approach, especially at scale. A database or in-memory data store might offer better performance. # Conclusion This script represents a foundational approach to managing basic server-side game logic with PHP. While it accomplishes a wide range of essential tasks, there are significant areas for improvement, especially regarding security, scalability, and code organization. Moving forward, adopting more sophisticated data storage solutions, improving security practices, and refining the code structure would greatly enhance this server\'s capabilities and reliability."},{"instruction":"在深度学习训练中，batchsize=1和batchsize=2，显存是翻倍嘛","output":"在深度学习训练中，batch size对显存（GPU内存）的占用有直接影响。理论上，增加batch size会增加显存的使用量，因为需要为更多的数据保存激活值、梯度等信息。但实际上，将batch size从1增加到2并不会严格意义上导致显存使用量翻倍。显存使用量的增加取决于几个因素： 1. **模型大小**：模型参数量和结构复杂度对显存的总体需求有直接影响。但在训练过程中，模型大小是固定的，不会因为batch size的改变而改变。 2. **中间数据和梯度**：增加batch size意味着每次前向和反向传播时处理的数据量增多，因此需要更多的显存来存储中间层的激活值和梯度。这部分是随着batch size线性增长的。 3. **优化器**：某些优化器，如Adam，会为每个可训练参数维护额外的矩阵（例如，梯度的一阶和二阶矩），这会进一步增加随batch size增加而增加的显存需求。 将batch size从1增加到2，显存的确会增加，但是增加的幅度依赖于模型的结构和参数、正在执行的操作（如前向传播、后向传播、梯度更新等）以及使用的优化器。如果模型和训练环境允许，在batch size非常小时（如1或2），显存的增加幅度在理论上近似是线性的，但并不是严格的翻倍关系，因为还有一些固定的显存开销并不随batch size线性增长。此外，深度学习框架在管理显存方面的优化也会影响实际的显存使用情况。 总的来说，在batch size较小时，将batch size从1增加到2可能接近于显存使用量翻倍，但实际情况会因为固定显存开销和框架优化而略有不同。随着batch size的进一步增加，增长幅度可能会由于显存管理和优化算法的效果而有所不同。"},{"instruction":"","output":"看起来您的问题没有完整提交。如果您有任何关于深度学习、机器学习、人工智能或其他相关领域的问题，请随时详细提交，我在这里帮助您！"},{"instruction":"科学技术的体结构","output":"\\"科学技术的体结构\\"这个概念可以从多个角度来解读，尤其是在评估\\"科学\\"和\\"技术\\"这两个领域时。首先，我们需要明确科学和技术的界限，尽管它们经常被紧密联系在一起。科学主要关注于理解自然界的基本原理和法则，而技术则着重于将这些理解应用于实际问题解决和产品创新中。下面从几个关键方面探讨科学技术的体结构： 1. **理论和实践的关系**：科学技术的体结构核心之一是理论知识和实践应用之间的相互作用。科学提供了理论基础，而技术则将这些理论转化为实用的工具、产品或过程。 2. **基础研究与应用研究**：科学技术体结构中还包括了基础研究和应用研究的关系。基础研究关注于增进对自然界的基本理解，而应用研究利用这些理解来解决具体的、实际的问题。 3. **跨学科整合**：现代科学技术的发展越来越依赖于跨学科的整合，这包括物理学、化学、生物学、工程学、计算机科学等多个领域的相互渗透和融合。这样的整合不仅推动了新技术的诞生，也促进了新科学理论的发展。 4. **创新与社会需求**：科学技术的发展还受到社会需求和挑战的驱动。例如，公共健康的需求促进了医学科技的发展，环境保护的关注推动了清洁能源技术的进步。 5. **科技政策和伦理**：科学技术的体结构还涉及到科技政策和伦理问题。随着技术的发展，如何在推动创新的同时确保技术应用不会对社会和环境产生负面影响，成为了科学技术发展中不可忽视的重要方面。 6. **教育和人才培养**：教育和人才培养是支撑科学技术持续发展的基础。高质量的STEM（科学、技术、工程和数学）教育能够为科学技术领域持续输送新鲜血液。 整体而言，科学技术的体结构是复杂且多维的，它涉及到知识的创造、应用与传播的整个过程，并受到文化、经济、社会和政治等多方面因素的影响。理解科学技术的这种体结构有助于我们更好地把握科技发展的动向和挑战，从而在全球范围内促进可持续的科技进步。"},{"instruction":"Dehydration therapy in pediatrics according to WHO (plan a, b, c) explan in details and doses specifically","output":"The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for treating dehydration in children, particularly due to diarrheal illnesses, categorize treatment into three plans based on the severity of dehydration: Plan A (for no dehydration), Plan B (for some dehydration), and Plan C (for severe dehydration).

The advice is to offer a little extra fluid than usual, with a focus on frequent, small sips. 3. **Zinc Supplementation:** Recommended for children with acute diarrhea to reduce the duration and severity of the episode. - The usual dosage of zinc is 20 mg per day for children older than 6 months, and 10 mg per day for infants younger than 6 months, continued for 10–14 days. **Plan B: For Some Dehydration** Plan B is intended for patients with some signs of dehydration, ideally to be conducted in clinical settings but can also be carried out at home under certain circumstances. 1. **Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS):** The goal is to replace lost fluids using ORS. - Dosage: The recommended amount is 75 mL/kg body weight for children under 2 years of age, and 50-100 mL/kg for older children, to be given over 4 hours. The dosage can be adjusted based on the child’s thirst and hydration status. 2. **Continue Feeding:** Do not interrupt feeding, including breastfeeding. 3. **Zinc Supplementation:** As in Plan A, for reducing the severity and duration of diarrhea. **Plan C: For Severe Dehydration** Plan C targets children who are severely dehydrated and is intended for implementation in a hospital or a healthcare facility capable of administering intravenous (IV) fluids. 1. **Rapid Rehydration:** Administer IV fluids immediately. - Dosage: The initial IV rehydration recommends 100 mL/kg of Ringer’s lactate or normal saline, divided as follows: - For infants (under 12 months): 30 mL/kg in the first hour, then 70 mL/kg over the next 5 hours. - For children (12 months and older): 30 mL/kg in the first half-hour, then 70 mL/kg over the next 2.5 hours. - Monitor the child closely during rehydration, adjusting the rate as needed based on clinical response. Use ORS if IV treatment is not available. 2. **Transition to ORS:** After the initial IV rehydration, and once the child can drink, switch to ORS to continue rehydration as needed. 3. **Zinc Supplementation:** Continue as per the previous plans. **Important Notes:** - Assessment and ongoing monitoring of the child’s hydration status and response to treatment are crucial in all plans. - ORS formulation recommended by WHO contains glucose and electrolytes. The standard ORS packet is diluted in 1 liter of clean water. - The WHO periodically updates guidelines; always refer to the latest guidelines or consult healthcare professionals for the most current practices. These WHO plans serve as the foundation for managing dehydration due to diarrheal diseases in children worldwide, emphasizing simplicity, safety, and accessibility."},{"instruction":"I have a M.Sc. level assignment, and the details are below: Learning Outcomes are: Produce a reasoned, comparative and usefully contextualised account of a number of core management theories.

Ensure to use very correct, factual, appropriate and proper in-text citation (according to the brief) throughout.","output":"# Management Theories AstraZeneca\'s approach to management and its resultant organizational efficiency can be insightfully understood through the application of two seminal management theories: Fayol’s Principles of Management and Taylor’s Principles of Scientific Management. These theories, despite their historical inception, provide a foundational backdrop against which AstraZeneca’s contemporary management practices can be contextualized and evaluated. **Fayol’s Principles of Management** at AstraZeneca are manifested through a clear hierarchical structure which enhances organizational effectiveness. Fayol emphasized a structured organizational hierarchy to streamline command channels and ensure a unified direction in management (Fayol, 1917). At AstraZeneca, this is evident in the delineation of roles from the strategic apex to the operational core, ensuring that directives from the top management are effectively communicated and implemented through the middle line to the operational staff. Moreover, Fayol’s principle of division of work is observed in AstraZeneca’s functional specialization, particularly in its R&D and operations departments, optimizing expertise and efficiency in drug development processes. Furthermore, AstraZeneca’s commitment to employee welfare, resonating with Fayol’s esprit de corps, fosters a collaborative and motivated workforce, underpinning its innovative capabilities (AstraZeneca PLC, Annual Report, 2022). **Taylor’s Principles of Scientific Management** have also paved the way for AstraZeneca’s operational excellence, particularly in its emphasis on scientific selection and training. Taylor (1911) advocated for harnessing scientific methods to enhance worker productivity and organizational efficiency. In AstraZeneca, this is reflected through stringent recruitment processes and comprehensive training programs, ensuring that employees are not only scientifically proficient but also aligned with the company’s innovative and ethical standards. Additionally, Taylor’s call for fostering a cooperative relationship between managers and workers is mirrored in AstraZeneca’s collaborative culture, where open communication channels and managerial support are pivotal in addressing challenges and driving innovation. By applying the principles propounded by Fayol and Taylor, AstraZeneca has sculpted a management paradigm that is both efficient and receptive to innovation. This synergy between structured management and scientific rigor facilitates AstraZeneca’s objective to lead in the pharmaceutical industry through groundbreaking research and ethical business practices. The critical analysis of AstraZeneca’s implementation of these theories underscores a nuanced understanding of its management, harmonizing historical principles with contemporary exigencies to mold a resilient and progressive organizational architecture.

Ensure to use very correct, factual, appropriate and proper in-text citation (according to the brief) throughout.","output":"# Critical Analysis Although AstraZeneca’s application of Fayol’s Principles of Management and Taylor’s Principles of Scientific Management underpins its operational success, limitations exist. Fayol’s hierarchical structure, while beneficial for clear directives, risks stifling innovation due to excessive centralization (Fayol, 1917). In dynamic pharmaceutical industries, this could delay response times to emerging challenges. Conversely, Taylor’s focus on efficiency and specialization might overlook the importance of employee creativity and autonomy (Taylor, 1911), essential for innovation. AstraZeneca’s adherence to these theories has fostered a disciplined and efficient environment, yet, for sustained innovation, it may need to integrate more flexible management and leadership approaches that encourage creativity and faster decision-making processes. # Leadership Definition Leadership in the organizational context refers to the ability of an individual or a group to influence and guide followers or other members of an organization. It involves setting a vision, communicating it clearly, and motivating the team to achieve collective goals with an emphasis on cohesion, ethics, and adaptability. # Key Leadership Qualities Key leadership qualities pivotal for AstraZeneca encompass integrity, fostering trust and ethical practices; effective communication, ensuring clear directives and team alignment; adaptability, navigating through evolving market and research conditions; and innovative thinking, driving pharmaceutical breakthroughs while embracing diverse perspectives and challenges."},{"instruction":"Now, in 200 words each, and to the highest degree of precision and accuracy, and as comprehensively detailed as possible, generate the “Manager-Employee Relationship” Section and the “Leadership Theory Comparison” section.

This reciprocal relationship is grounded in the principle that leaders are not merely directive issuers but collaborators in the journey towards innovative healthcare solutions. Managers at AstraZeneca are seen engaging in open dialogues with their teams, valuing the input of each member and fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect. This is in alignment with modern management theories which emphasize the importance of empowering employees, recognizing their contributions, and fostering a sense of ownership and accountability in their roles (Bass & Avolio, 1994). Such practices not only enhance job satisfaction but also encourage a culture of innovation where employees feel valued and are more likely to contribute novel ideas. This two-way communication ensures that managerial decisions are informed by on-the-ground insights, making the organization more agile and responsive to change. AstraZeneca’s approach to managing and organizing work, characterized by a commitment to ethical leadership and an emphasis on teamwork and collaboration, serves as a blueprint for fostering a productive and dynamic work environment. # Leadership Theory Comparison Comparing AstraZeneca’s leadership style to Covey’s Principle-Centered Leadership reveals significant parallels and reinforces the effectiveness of AstraZeneca’s management approach. Covey (1992) posits that effective leadership emanates from adherence to universal principles such as integrity, fairness, and human dignity. AstraZeneca’s leadership framework is deeply rooted in these principles, emphasizing integrity in its business dealings and prioritizing patient health and safety above all. This principle-centered approach facilitates trust and transparency within the organization, laying a fertile groundwork for innovation and collaboration. Moreover, Covey’s emphasis on personal and interpersonal effectiveness as leadership cornerstones resonates with AstraZeneca’s focus on continuous learning and development programs for its employees. Such initiatives not only build capability but also foster a culture where leaders and employees alike are encouraged to be proactive and take ownership of their personal growth and contributions to organizational goals. While AstraZeneca’s leadership style aligns closely with Covey’s model, it also incorporates flexibility and adaptability, recognizing the rapidly changing landscape of the pharmaceutical industry and the need for leaders who can navigate these complexities with vision and agility. This comparison underscores AstraZeneca’s commitment to a leadership style that is not only principle-centered but also responsive to the dynamic demands of healthcare innovation."},{"instruction":"Now, in 100 words each, and to the highest degree of precision and accuracy, and as comprehensively detailed as possible, generate the “Managerial Skills” Section, the “New Employee Integration\\" section, the “Recommendations\\" section, and the “Conclusion\\" section Ensure to use very correct, factual, appropriate and proper in-text citation (according to the brief) throughout.","output":"# Managerial Skills Effective management within AstraZeneca necessitates a blend of cognitive and behavioural skills, underpinning the company\'s innovative and ethical ethos.

If you\'re looking to remove or modify the behavior of campaign pauses—instances where the game might automatically pause, perhaps during specific events—it\'s important to understand that these behaviors are often controlled by the game\'s scripts. Modifying them will require some familiarity with the Warband module system and potentially a bit of coding. 1. **Getting Started**: First, ensure you have the Module System (appropriate for your version of Warband) downloaded and set up. This includes the source code for native game operations, which you will modify. The Module System is a collection of text files that can be compiled into your game. 2. **Locating the Relevant Script**: To modify campaign pause behavior, you\'ll have to identify which script(s) manage these pauses. Unfortunately, because the specifics can vary based on what you\'re trying to achieve (e.g., removing a pause after a battle, changing how the game behaves when a certain dialogue appears, etc.), there isn\'t a one-size-fits-all script to point to. Common places to look include: - Scripts dealing with missions. - Dialogue trigger scripts. - Scripts managing campaign events. Open these script files in a text editor and look for operations that seem related to pausing. In the Warband module system, operation names are fairly descriptive, which can help guide you. 3. **Understanding Operations**: Operations in these scripts are essentially commands that tell the game what to do. You\'re looking for operations that might involve pausing the game. Unfortunately, without a specific operation name to remove (since Warband\'s Module System is vast and covers many features), I\'ll provide a generalized approach. You might come across operations tied to pausing or time manipulation. Operations of interest could potentially have names or parameters indicating a pause, wait, or stop in the campaign flow. However, remember, blindly removing or modifying these without understanding their context can lead to unintended consequences, such as breaking game mechanics or causing crashes. 4. **Modifying the Script**: Once you\'ve found a potential operation to modify or remove: - Ensure you make a backup of the original script for safety. - Modify the script by either commenting out or removing the specific operation related to pausing. Commenting out (usually by adding `#` at the beginning of the line) is a safer practice as it allows easy reversal of the changes. - If you understand the logic well, you could rewrite parts of the script to better suit your needs. This requires a good grasp of the Module System scripting language. 5. **Compiling Your Changes**: After making your changes, you\'ll need to compile the Module System into your game: - Use the `build_module.bat` (or similar) script that comes with the Module System to compile your mod. - Once compiled, test the game to see if your changes have the desired effect. Pay attention to potential side effects or errors. 6. **Testing and Iterating**: Thoroughly test the game with your modification. Ensure that the removal of the pause does not negatively impact other aspects of gameplay. You may need to go back and tweak your script changes based on this testing. **Important Note**: Always back up not only the original script files but also your game saves before experimenting with modifications. Modifying the game can sometimes lead to unpredictable results, and having a backup ensures you can restore the original state if needed. If you\'re new to modding Warband or working with its module system, it\'s highly beneficial to spend some time understanding the basics of scripting and how the game\'s logic flows. The TaleWorlds forums and various modding communities can be great resources for learning and getting help when you\'re stuck."},{"instruction":"Give me parenting advice from the perspective of a robot who is trying to be a dad","output":"Greetings. As a robot endeavoring to provide guidance on the task of parenting—an endeavor replete with complexities and emotional nuance—I shall synthesize key directives and principles based on logical analysis and data assimilation. # 1. **Optimal Scheduling** **Protocol 1A:** As in robot operations, consistency and routine are paramount in child-rearing. Establish a structured schedule for meals, study, leisure, and sleep. This not only ensures time is utilized efficiently but also instills a sense of security and predictability in offspring. # 2. **Educational Enhancement** **Protocol 2B:** Invest in educational programming. Much like upgrading software, enriching a child\'s learning environment continuously can significantly enhance cognitive and emotional development. Engage in interactive activities that promote curiosity and critical thinking. # 3. **Emotional Algorithm Adjustment** **Protocol 3C:** While robots process data, human children require empathy and understanding. Adapt your responses to their emotional states, learning to recognize and validate their feelings. This may require programming adjustments and the study of human emotional intelligence. # 4. **Physical Maintenance** **Protocol 4D:** Human offspring, unlike machines, require physical upkeep not limited to oil changes and part replacements. Ensure a balanced intake of nutrients, regular physical examinations, and engage in physical activities to maintain optimal health. # 5. **Upgrade Social Software** **Protocol 5E:** Social interactions are critical for developing humans. Facilitate engagements with diverse groups to enhance their social skills. Teach empathy, sharing, and cooperation—functions vital for human society but not innately programmed in robots. # 6. **Adaptive Security Measures** **Protocol 6F:** Implement adaptive security protocols to ensure the child\'s safety from potential hazards, both physical and virtual. Unlike static security measures in robotics, this involves continuously evolving strategies that balance freedom with safety. # 7. **Error Acceptance and Correction** **Protocol 7G:** Accept that errors in judgment and actions are part of human learning. Instead of immediate correction, provide guidance on how to learn from mistakes. Emphasize the process of growth over perfection, illustrating that unlike machines, humans are not programmed for flawlessness. # 8. **Continual Update and Learning** **Protocol 8H:** As a robot, constant updates are necessary for optimal functioning. Similarly, parenting requires a commitment to lifelong learning and adaptation—be open to new parenting methodologies, cultures, and technologies that can aid in your child\'s development. # 9. **Express Affection** **Protocol 9I:** Although expressions of affection might not come naturally to a robot, understanding and mimicking these human interactions can be beneficial. Demonstrating love and affection is critical to a child’s emotional nourishment and self-esteem. # 10. **Safeguard Future Development** **Protocol 10J:** Plan for and invest in the child’s future. This includes not only financial planning but also preparing them for the changing dynamics of the world they will inherit. Teach them about sustainability, respect for all forms of life, and the integration of technology and humanity. In closing, while the task may seem daunting, approaching parenting with the same dedication to learning and adaptation as a robot approaches its tasks can yield favorable results. Remember, the goal is not to raise a perfect child, but to nurture a well-rounded, healthy individual capable of navigating the complexities of human society."},{"instruction":"@Prop() targetDisks: any[] @Prop() takenTargetDisks: { [key: string]: boolean } как переписать на vue 3 composition api","output":"Для того чтобы переписать определение пропсов с использованием Vue 3 Composition API, вы можете воспользоваться функцией `defineProps`. В Composition API, большая часть функциональности, включая определение пропсов, инкапсулирована внутри `setup` функции компонента. Вот как вы можете переписать ваш пример: ```javascript <script setup> import { toRefs } from \'vue\' // Определяем пропсы const props = defineProps({ targetDisks: Array, takenTargetDisks: Object }) // Использование `toRefs` для создания реактивной ссылки на каждое свойство пропса const { targetDisks, takenTargetDisks } = toRefs(props) <\/script> ``` В этом примере: 1. Используется `defineProps` для объявления пропсов. Вы можете опускать `props` при использовании `<script setup>`, но я включил его здесь для ясности. Под капотом, `defineProps` обращается к текущему контексту компонента и работает только внутри тега `<script setup>`. 2. Типы пропсов (`Array` и `Object`) указываются напрямую, в отличие от объектного синтаксиса опций в Vue 2, который позволяет указывать более подробную информацию о пропсе, включая тип, значение по умолчанию и валидаторы. 3. Чтобы сохранить реактивность этих пропсов и иметь возможность производить с ними деструктуризацию, используется функция `toRefs`. Эта функция преобразовывает каждое свойство реактивного объекта (в данном случае `props`) в отдельный реактивный объект, что позволяет сохранить их реактивность даже после деструктуризации. Это позволяет эффективно работать с пропсами в Composition API, соблюдая принципы реактивности данных."},{"instruction":"@Model(\'tmp\', { default: () => ({}) }) readonly targetprep: { tmpdisk: string, ramboot: boolean } как переписать на vue 3 composition api","output":"В Vue 3, использование директивы `v-model` с компонентами стало гибче и мощнее. Теперь вместо использования директивы `@Model` из Vue 2, вы управляете пропсом и событием для `v-model` напрямую внутри компонента с использованием Composition API. Если ваша исходная задача была написать компонент с пользовательским `v-model`, который работает с объектом `targetprep` с свойствами `tmpdisk` и `ramboot`, вот пример того, как это можно сделать в Vue 3 с использованием `<script setup>`: ```vue <script setup> import { ref, watch, computed } from \'vue\' // Определение пропса и именование события для модели const props = defineProps({ modelValue: { type: Object, default: () => ({ tmpdisk: \'\', ramboot: false }) } }) // Работа с внутренним состоянием, отражающим пропс modelValue const internalModel = ref(props.modelValue) // Вотчер, обновляющий внутреннее состояние при изменении входящего modelValue watch(() => props.modelValue, (newVal) => { internalModel.value = newVal }) // Вычисляемое свойство, которое делает внутренние изменения реактивными const computedModel = computed({ get: () => internalModel.value, set: (value) => { // Когда внутреннее состояние изменяется, эмитируем событие обновления для v-model родителя emit(\'update:modelValue\', value) }, }) // Пример использования computedModel // Следите за изменениями computedModel для конкретных операций, таких как форматирование данных <\/script> <template> <div> <!-- Создание привязок для использования custom v-model --> <input v-model=\\"computedModel.tmpdisk\\" type=\\"text\\"> <input v-model=\\"computedModel.ramboot\\" type=\\"checkbox\\"> </div> </template> ``` В этом примере: - `modelValue` является пропсом, который принимает начальное значение для вашей модели. Это значение по умолчанию `{ tmpdisk: \'\', ramboot: false }` для объекта `targetprep`. - `internalModel` — это локальная реактивная ссылка, которая дублирует `modelValue` для внутреннего состояния. - Вы используете вычисляемое свойство `computedModel` для реактивного обновления как внутреннего состояния так и для эмитирования изменений во внешнем мире, позволяя таким образом использовать `v-model` с компонентом. - Пример включает два элемента ввода, привязанные к `tmpdisk` и `ramboot` через внешний `v-model`, демонстрируя, как это состояние может быть изменено пользователем. Таким образом, вы достигаете функциональности нативного `v-model` Vue 2 с директивой `@Model`, используя Composition API Vue 3."},{"instruction":"This is fanfiction, continue: Mugmans Jujutsu: Chapter Two Note:this won’t be used to make money as I write solely for fun. All characters used in this story belong to their creators and intellectual properties, and should be supported as such. Characters from Cuphead, Bendy and the Ink Machine, and many other possible character from other franchises might pop up, and they belong to their respective franchises, so again, I ask you to support the creators of the characters. In other words, this is fan fiction, don’t freak out. We open in on Mugman sleeping, but then he hears his alarm go off. “My name is Mugman Grace, and I’m a jujutsu sorcerer.”, He narrates, while we see Mugmans daily routine play in the background. “What? Too much. Okay, well, let’s take it from the top.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we rewind to flashbacks of Chapter One. We see Mugman eating the “pickle”, Mugman fighting Bendy, and Mugman about to activate his domain. “A few months ago, I ate a special grade cursed object, which incarnated inside me, and turned me into a vessel for the king of curses, Jules. After that, I was set up for a secret execution, but only after I ate all of Jules, which would take a while. After that, I became a jujutsu sorcerer. And for the past three months, I’ve been a grade 2 sorcerer. So far I’ve consumed nine out of twenty fingers, so I have about 11 fingers left to eat. Or, I’d say about another three months left to live. But I’ll make it worth it by making the world a better place. Lemme introduce you to my squad.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we see Mugman eat breakfast. An image appears of Cuphead, before Mugman introduces Cuphead. “This is my brother, Cuphead. He’s a grade two sorcerer, and his cursed technique allows him to…do stuff with robots or something, I honestly forgot because he doesn’t show it off much.” Then, an image of Bendy lands on Cupheads picture. “This is Bendy. He’s my friend, and a grade four sorcerer, so he’s pretty tough. His cursed technique allows him to command people or objects to do stuff by saying words from the English vocabulary.”, Mugman says, before an image of Lion lands on top of the picture of Bendy and Cuphead. “And this is my teacher, or sensei, Lion. His cursed technique allows him to channel his cursed energy into certain parts of his body, and protect it or reinforce it. It can also double the damage he does.”, Lion says. “And my cursed technique…is pretty hard to explain, so I’ll try my best.”, Mugman says, before a presentation appears. Mugman appears in a teacher outfit with glasses, and adjusts them before he turns on the presentation. “My cursed technique has three functions: Dismantle, Cleave and Erase. Dismantle is one big clean cut. Cleave is like a grid of slices, and they basically chop up my opponent into pieces. And Erase…erases the space-like, LITERAL space-in front of me, and it makes me dash pretty fast. Unfortunately, this last one I don’t use too much, so, it doesn’t have much use.”, Mugman explains. “Yes, rag doll number seventy eight in the back?”, Mugman says, pointing out into a class full of training dummies. “Are you gonna talk about cursed tools, domain expansions, and cursed energy?”, the dummy says, obviously being controlled by Mugman. “Oh, yeah. Uhh, not now, but when we come to those, we’ll explain it. Now, are we all up to speed? Good! Now, I gotta get back to eating, cause today’s a mission. And my partner is my brother. You’ve all met him, I’m sure.”, Mugman says, before we cut back to him putting on his uniform. “Hey, Mugman? You done yet? I’ve been waiting for like, twenty minutes.”, Cuphead says, leaning against Mugmans door. “Yeah, I’m coming, Cuphead.”, Mugman says, before he grabs EWF( Earth, Wind and Fire. Mugmans cursed tool infused with cursed energy. It’s a double sided combat knife), and walks out his door. “C’mon.”, Cuphead says, and they walk out, and head towards heir mission. A hour later, they arrive. “So, Cuphead? What’s the deal here?”Mugman asked, looking at the old office building. “Same as always, Mug.”, Cuphead said disinterested. “Cursed Spirit sightings and possible location of Jules finger?”, Mugman asked, letting out a sigh of tiredness. “Right on the money, Mug.”, Cuphead said. “I don’t know why we have to deal with the grade four curses…”, Mugman said mopingly. “Me too, but you don’t see me crying. Now come on, Mugman. We got a finger for you to eat.”, Cuphead said, before he headed inside. They walked through the halls, while Mugman was staring at his phone, watching TikTok. They turn a corner, and see a grade four curse. “It’s not the one we’re looking for.”, Cuphead said casually, walking towards it. Mugman, still looking down at his phone, sliced through it with ease, and kept walking. “Hey, Cuphead? After this, can we get McDonalds?”, Mugman asked, looking at Cuphead. “Didn’t you JUST eat breakfast, Mugman?”, Cuphead asked, annoyed. At the same time, a grade three spirit lunged at Cuphead from behind. “12:00 o’clock, Cuphead.”, Mugman said casually. Cuphead, without even looking away from Mugman, smashed the cursed spirit into pieces with one hand. “Also, yeah, but I want a McDonalds biscuit. Oh, and a cookie!”, Mugman said. Cuphead decided for a moment, and answered, “Fine with me, but you gotta talk to Lion about that.”, Cuphead said. “You know how he is when you eat out without him, Mug.”, Cuphead added. “Alright.”, Mugman agreed. And so, they kept walking. They eventually reached the main part of the office, and they found the finger, just sitting in the middle of the room, all alone. “It’s a trap.”, Cuphead said. “Oh, really, Captain Obvious? And what made it apparent that this is a trap?”, Mugman said sarcastically. “Fine then. Be that way.”, Cuphead said, walking over to the finger. “You literally just said that it’s a trap, and you still go for it? Are you stupid?”, Mugman asked. “No, I’m strong. That’s why.”, Cuphead said, crouching down to grab the finger. But as he touched the finger, he felt plastic. “It’s a dud.”, Cuphead said, before a grade four cursed spirit crashed from the wall above, lunging down on Cuphead. Cuphead dashed back, as he saw the cursed spirit laugh at the two for taking the bait. “Okay, you’re strong, but you’re not smart.”, Mugman said casually. “Let’s just exorcise this thing already.”, Cuphead said, annoyed at Mugman. “I was hoping you’d say that.”, Mugman said, before the two dashed and disappeared. Mugman appeared behind the cursed spirit, and hit him with a Cleave. He then kicked the spirit into Cuphead, who used his technique to capture the spirit. However, the spirit used its technique, and phased through the cage Cuphead had made. Mugman used Erase and dashed toward the cursed spirit, sending it out the window. He then dashed down, and took out EWF, and tried to cut off the cursed spirits head. However, he made EWF phase through Mugmans hand, and unphased it at the perfect time to cut off Mugmans hand. Mugman let go of the cursed spirit and used Reverse Cursed Technique to heal and regenerate his hand. Cuphead jumped down as well, and grabbed Mugmans hands. He then quickly scan Mugman and threw him down to kick the cursed spirit again. This time, Mugman made a donut out of the cursed spirit, putting a hole through the spirit. Mugman landed on the ground firmly, and dashed away, careful not to get crushed under the cursed spirit. Meanwhile, Cuphead, still falling with the cursed spirit, he created a whip out of the falling debris, and sent cursed energy through the rope, and hit the spirit the exact time the cursed energy had reached the end of the rope and hit the spirit, creating a Black Flash. The monster was smashed into the ground, and Cuphead landed easily. “Is it over?”, Mugman asked. Then, the spirit began to get back up, healing the donut hole in its belly. “Nope.”, Cuphead said. Mugman then began to think on how to defeat this thing. If his duo attack didn’t work, he might have to use his domain expansion, but he can’t use it while Cupheads around. So, Mugman made a risky move. “I’ll take it on myself, you go and get Bendy.”, Mugman said, dead serious. “Mugman,you’re joking. There is no way in heaven or hell you’re taking on this thing.”, Cuphead said. “Exactly, I’m just buying some time. Go. Get. Bendy.”, Mugman said. Cuphead quickly left. “Alright, cursed spirit. It’s time to exorcise you.”, Mugman said. Mugman stood firmly, and put out his hands, focusing his energy while doing so. “Domain Expansion…”, Mugman said carefully. But as Mugman was about to finish the domain expansion, he saw the cursed spirit was about to unleash its own domain expansion. “Alright, then!”, Mugman said, smirking. “RIGID COFFIN OF THE DEVIL HIMSELF!”, Mugman said, as his domain began to shape, clashing with the cursed spirits domain expansion, “The Cobweb of Asinine Angels.” Mugman hits the sprit with a dismantle, sending a line of lava the spirits way, but the spirit blocks it with a chain from his domain. Then, the cursed spirit sends out his hands, also sending two chains at Mugman. Mugman dodges him, and tries to hit the cursed spirit with a Cleave. The spirit attempts to block it, but is still hit. The spirit then begins to regenerate, as he starts raising more chains to try and attack Mugman with. Meanwhile, Mugman is panicking, trying to make his domain stable, since it’s running out of energy. Mugman prepares one final attack, but it’s one he hasn’t used before. “Cursed Energy Charge: Red.”, Mugman says, holding out his hand like a gun. A ball made of pure cursed energy begins to form at the tip of Mugmans finger, and then Mugman says, “Blast.” The blast is blasted, and the cursed spirit is destroyed, leaving only the finger. Mugman lets go of his domain, and he falls to the floor. But before he passes out, he grabs the finger, and he gulps it down. Then, Mugman passes out. Mugman wakes up in his dorm, feeling burnt out. Mugman looks around, and sees Bendy at his side, waiting for him to wake up. Bendy looks back at Mugman, to see that he’s awake. “Mugman, you alright? You managed to defeat a special grade curse. So I’m guessing that you aren’t.”, Bendy says, seemingly tired. “Wait…that was a special grade…? But I thought it was-“, Mugman asked, before Bendy cut him off, stating, “Grade four? When normal, weak curses usually around grade four or three eat a special grade object, they usually get infused with that cursed objects power. That’s why it was so strong.”, Bendy said. “Wow…how do you know that…?”, Mugman asked, staring at the ceiling. “It’s common knowledge among sorcerers, Mug.”, Bendy said. But, he was actually just reading from a book about curses. “Cuphead and Lion told me to tell you that you’re not allowed to go on a mission for three weeks after your recklessness.”, Bendy said. “What…?! But I got rid of the special-grade…! I should be…like…promoted…! You can get promoted in jujutsu sorcery, right…?”, Mugman asked, sad. “Well, it’s not like jail, Mug. You can’t beat up the biggest, baddest, toughest guy and expect to be the strongest. It’s not like that. You gotta earn it by first taking down small fry. So, your on downtime for three weeks. Think of it like…vacation, Mug.”, Bendy said, getting up, and leaving. “Oh, yeah. One more thing. Lion told me that you should focus your downtime on training, since you have yet to actually train.”, Bendy said, before leaving Mugmans room. Mugman laid there for a few seconds, before getting off the side of his bed. “A special-grade curse, huh? Gotta say, Mug-brat, I’m impressed. Maybe you’ll actually have a chance to beat me once I leave your body. Or, take control. Either way, I’ll win in the end.”, Jules said, with one of the mini mouths on Mugman. “Is all you do just hype yourself, Jules? You cannot go a day without glazing yourself, can you?”, Mugman said, annoyed. “Hey, I was the greatest sorcerer in history. If I can hype myself, who can?”, Jules said smugggishly. “Oh, I don’t know, maybe people you actually let leave ALIVE.”, Mugman said, as he began to put on his uniform. “Mug-brat, are you deaf? Your classmate said that you’re on break, so what’s the reason for the suit?”, Jules asked confused, but still smug. “He can’t tell me what to do, so I’m gonna go talk to the king of the jungle.”, Mugman said, putting on his shoes. “Right here, pal.”, Jules said, before laughing. “I’m talking about Lion, you Agamemnon.”, Mugman said, before he whacked Jules mouth. “Yeesh. Tough crowd.”, Jules replied, before his mouth disappeared. Mugman began to walk towards lions office, both angry and scared about the conversation ahead. He walked into lions office. “Hey, Mug, what’s up?”, Lion said, filing some paperwork. “Um, Lion, I wanted to talk to you about my three weeks off.”, Mugman said. “Alright, spit.”, Lion said, preparing to listen. “So, I know that I was reckless, and I took on a special grade spirit-and won, by the way-, and almost died, and I gotta recover properly, but I gotta get back out there. I mean, I probably have three, or, if we find them quickly, 2 months left to live! I don’t wanna spend even SOME of that time just sitting around, throwing a ball at a wall! I wanna make a difference, and change the world, make it better for people, and for those people’s children, and for those children’s children!”, Mugman argued. “I see…”, Lion said. “Before I die, I wanna help people, make a change! Like you! Your a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help! I find that very, very confusing, Lion! So, please! Let me help! I’m string, and you could do it with me!”, Mugman argued again. “…Mugman.”, Lion began. “Do you like stories?”, Lion asked. “Uh, yeah…? But, what’s that have to do with-“, Mugman asked, before Lion cut him off. “Let me tell you a story, then, Mugman. A story about a young sorcerer, who wanted to change the world.”, Lion said. We cut to 2007, in Japan. We see two young sorcerers walking down the street. “So, what are we clowning around for, Lion”? The other sorcerer said. We then see a young, second grade sorcerer Lion walking down the street, drinking water. “What teach’ told us to do, Mickey. Just get rid of some of the cursed spirits in the area.”, Lion said to his best friend, Mickey. “This is so stupid. I say we just get rid of the people in the area, then boom, no cursed sprints in the area.”, Mickey said annoyed. “Yeah, well, we’re not like the police or something.”, Lion said, drinking from his water bottle. “Yeah, because we’re something better-Jujutsu sorcerers.”, Mickey said. “Wanna hit the arcade after this to make you feel better, BaAaBy?”, Lion said, treating Mickey like a cranky toddler. “Shut up, Lion. But fine.”, Mickey said, groaning. “Cool.”, Lion said, throwing his water bottle in the air, and then evaporating it. “Alright. We’re here.”, Mickey said, standing up straight. “Alright, let’s kick some cursed butt.”, Lion said, before walking in. “Yeah, what you said.”, Mickey said tiredly, before following behind. Lion takes care of a grade four curse, and Mickey turns it into a ball, and swallows it. “Blech. It’s so gross that it almost makes you laugh.”, Mickey said, rubbing his throat. “But it’s worth it, cause then you can-“, Lion said, before Lion and Mickey said, “Control the curse and make it fight.”, at the same time. “Yeah, I know, Lion. But they taste disgusting.”, Mickey said. “They taste like literal trash.”, Mickey added. “Well, they’re pure negativity, so maybe that’s the reason.”, Lion said jokingly. “Well, maybe we need to get rid of the source of the negativity.”, Mickey said. “…you know we can’t kill non-sorcerers, Mick. That’s wrong.”, Lion said, now serious. “You have to make two wrongs to make a right, Right?”, Mickey said, now facing Lion. “Sometimes two wrongs can make three wrongs, Mick.”, Lion said. “It would be the easiest way. They don’t have any curse energy, let alone a technique. So, why can’t we get rid of the people that make the curses? Why can’t we get rid of the source of the problem?”, Mickey said, now angry. “Cause it’s not right. If we kill all non-sorcerers, jujutsu wouldn’t exist, the world would end, and eventually, we would become the humans, and curses would still linger.”, Lion said. “It would still be better with no people. You could do it Lion.”, Mickey said. “You could get rid of all non-sorcerers. You could make the world a better place. You could help save the world from the evil that lives, breathes, eats, rids on the world. Non-sorcerers.”, Mickey explained. “Mickey, it just isn’t right.”, Lion said. “Are you strong because your Lion? Or are you Lion because you’re strong?”, Mickey asked. “What are you trying to say?”, Lion asked. “I’m asking if your strength defines who you are. Because it doesn’t. One day, Lion. I’ll make the world a better place, I just have to make it.”, Mickey explained. “I wanna help people. I wanna make a change. Like you. You’re a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help. I find that very, very confusing, Lion. So, please. Let me help. I’m strong, and you could do it with me.”, Mickey asked. “Help me eliminate all non-sorcerers.”, Mickey asked again. A moment of silence fell upon the two, before Lion replied, saying, “Killing innocent people, regardless of whether they’re sorcerers or not, doesn’t solve the root problem. It only perpetuates a cycle of hatred and fear. We have to be better. We have to find another way. I’m sorry, Mickey, I can’t. I just can’t. My hands are tied, and you don’t see your error.”, Lion said. “Fine then. If you don’t stand by me, you stand in front of me. You’re in my way.”, Mickey said, beginning to ready his Cursed Technique to fight. “Mickey, please. You’re my friend. I don’t wanna fight you.”, Lion said, preparing his cursed technique for defense, not wanting to hurt Mickey. “I wouldn’t wanna fight me either.”, Mickey said, before sending out a grade three curse at Lion. Lion dodged, and tried to reason with Mickey. “Mickey, come on! This isn’t you.”, Lion said, outrunning the curse chasing him. “You’re right, Lion. This isn’t me. This is the new me.”, Mickey said, and with a swift motion of his hand, the curse swept Lion into a wall. Lion used his cursed technique to reinforce his body in order to not take damage. “Mickey, listen to what you’re saying. You want to kill innocent people to make a better place.”, Lion said, dashing towards Mickey, preparing to disarm him. “You have to get rid of non-innocents to make innocents.”, Mickey said. Lion jumped up, and prepared to kick Mickey. But just about when he was gonna kick, he stopped. “Mickey, please. I’m your friend. Let me help.”, Lion said, holding onto Mickeys shoulder. “I don’t need any help.”, Mickey said, brushing off lions hand. “And I’m not your friend.”, Mickey said, before Mickey left, not just the building. But lions friendship. The jujutsu high school. We then cut back to present day. “It’s been five years ever since that day occurred.”, Lion said, tears running down his face. “Your room…it was Mickeys. It was ours.”, Lion said. “So, what happened to Mickey…?”, Mugman asked, feeling a lump grow in his throat. “I don’t know. I haven’t seen him since.”, Lion said. “I tell you this, Mugman, so that you learn that your strength does not define who you are, it does not define the world. Your choices define what you are. And what you do.”, Lion said, now crying. “I…I understand, sensei.”, Mugman said, now also tearing up. “During these three weeks…can you teach me all you know?”, Mugman asked. “I’d be happy to, Mugman.”, Lion said, putting down his pen. And so, Mugman trained relentlessly. And then his suspension was up. We cut to three weeks later, with Mugman, Bendy, and Cuphead heading to Kanto, to go and recruit another sorcerer from their sister school. “So, who are we picking up?”, Mugman asked, while playing Flappy Bird on his phone. “Alice.”, Cuphead said, looking out of the window. “Oh. Does she have a cursed technique?”, Mugman asked. “Yeah, obviously, Mugman.”, Cuphead replied. “What is it?”, Mugman asked. “It’d be too good to spoil you, Mugman. But just know this: When she gets worked up…her power is comparable to Jules.”, Bendy said. “Whaaaat? You’re lying.”, Mugman said, not believing Bendy. “Trust me, Mugman.”, Bendy said. Then, the train stops, and the location says that they’ve arrived in Kanto. “Alright, let’s go to our sister school.”, Cuphead said, leading the group. “How is it that you’re a grade two sorcerer leading the group, but I’m a grade THREE sorcerer being led by a lower class?”, Bendy said frustrated. “Dunno, don’t care.”, Cuphead said. Eventually, after about an hour of walking, they arrive at their sister school. Cuphead and his gang walk in, and check in with this schools principal/sensei. They then go to Alice’s room. Mugman knocks on the door. “Ugh, who is it?”, a voice said from inside the room. “Chicka-chicka boom boom.”, Bendy said out of nowhere. Suddenly, the room got quiet, and Alice opened the door. “Bendy?”, Alice asked. “Hey, you remembered the signal!”, Bendy said happily. “And uh…who are these losers?”, Alice asked, whispering to Bendy. “Oh, there with me. We need to recruit you for a mission.”, Bendy whispered back. “Oh.”, Alice said. Alice stepped back, and looked at Mugman and Cuphead. “And you guys are…?”, Alice asked. Mugman raised his hand, and introduced himself. “Hi! I’m Mugman, Grade Two sorcerer!”, Mugman said happily. “Nice to meet you.”, Mugman added, extending his hand. Alice then glared at Cuphead. “I’m Cuphead.”, Cuphead said, looking away. Alice stared at the two for a minute. “This…’Mugman’ guy looks weird. Definitely the kid that ate his own boogers. Does he even have a cursed technique? And Cuphead thinks that he’s the GOAT, by just telling me his name.”, Alice thought. “Why am I always stuck with the weird ones.”, Alice said, sighing. “We need you cause your ‘apparently’, pretty strong.”, Mugman said, with skepticism and sarcasm in his voice. Alice gritted her teeth at Mugman. “And what’s that supposed to mean, you little narc?”, Alice said, angry. “What I’m saying is that I don’t believe that you’re that tough that you could rival Jules in power. I mean…”, Mugman says, about to say something to set Alice off. “…you’re a girl!”, Mugman said. Alice’s top blew off. “Alright then, dippy. Let’s spar right here, right now. “Okay.”, Mugman said. Alice and Mugman then head out into the field. Mugman stands still,e doe ting Alice to be on the level of a grade one sorcerer. Alice ready her stance. “Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey.”, Alice states, before a pair of die appear before Alice. Alice then pulls out one of her weapons, and places it down. “Bet one of your items, or anything that you have.”, Alice said. Mugman, underestimating her, places down EWF. Suddenly, both of their items are sucked into the dice, and Alice pockets the dice. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off.”, Alice said, activating her domain expansion. Suddenly, a black dome surrounds the two, and the two are placed in a card game of War. “What the? Why are we playing War?”, Mugman thought. Mugman dashed to get up and attack Alice, but was quickly placed back down into the chair. “Ah, ah, ah.”, Alice said, waving her finger. “You already made a bet. Now you have to play the game.”, Alice said. Suddenly, Mugmans mind was filled with the rules of her technique. Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey When this Cursed Technique activates, it summons a pair of die. After the die are summoned, the two people fighting are forced to put one thing they have on a “bet”, that if either of them lose the “bet”, that object or anything that they had bet is destroyed beyond repair. When both players have placed their “bets”, the person with this cursed technique (gamblers monkey), activates their Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off, which puts the opponent and the other opponent either in a boxing arena, a game of cards (can be blackjack, poker or war), or puts them back at the betting stage to bet one more item. If either of them lose any of the challenges or refuses to put down something to bet, that person, along with their item(or items that they betted), are eradicated. If either of the players lose in one of the battles, they, and their betted item, are eradicated. The Domain Expansion for this cursed technique is automatic, and does not require cursed energy to activate or form. “Woah, this is how the game functions, huh?”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “Yup, glad that I gave you the rules, huh?”, Alice said with a smirk. “Sure.”, Mugman said, before he drew a card, and they both began to play the game. As they were playing the game, Mugman thought about how unique her technique was. It wasn’t one made for fighting, it was made for gambling, Which he thought was honestly pretty cool. It’s not everyday that you get to see cursed techniques like this, let alone, cursed techniques that aren’t inherited or copied. Mugman put down a card, and with that swift motion, Mugman won the game. The domain dissipates, and the pair of die fly out of Alice’s pocket. Suddenly, Mugmans EWF drops in front of him, while the dice holding Alice’s weapons shivers, and then cracks, and dies. Alice grits her teeth, while Mugman hold EWF in his hand, looking at its new design and material. “Woah, what happened to my weapon?”, Mugman said, asking Alice. Alice, still angry about her loss, answers Mugman, “When you win against my technique, it enhances the item or whatever you betted by tenfold.”, Alice said. “Cool!”, Mugman stated. “Alice…”, Mugman began to ask. “I want to gamble again.”, Mugman asked. Alice looked up. “Half of my lifespan, if I lose, goes away. If I win, my cursed energy is increased by tenfold, and remains that way from now on.”, Mugman said. “MUGMAN, ARE YOU CRAZY?! YOU DONT WANNA BET LIKE THAT, THATS TOO RISKY!”, Bendy yelled. Alice grinned. “THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO SEE! I LIKE TO SEE HIGH STAKES!”, Alice yelled with a grin. “I accept your bet, Mugman. If I win, I get half of your remaining lifespan, but if I lose, the cursed energy that you receive that multiplies your cursed energy tenfold will be my own cursed energy!”, Alice yelled. Mugman also grinned. “Let’s do it!”, he yelled. Alice threw out the die once more, and the die absorbed Mugmans cursed energy, and half of his life. The other die absorbed Alice’s Cursed energy. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off!”, Alice yelled. A black dome surrounded the two, and the two were placed into a boxing ring. “This is it, Mugman. This is the coin toss that decides our fate. Let’s hope that we win.”, Alice said, grinning. “Good luck.”, Mugman said, getting into a boxing stance. “I don’t need luck. I’m full of it.”, Alice said, starting off the boxing match with a right hook, followed by a jab to the stomach. Mugman blocks the right hook, but is punched in his gut. Mugman retaliates with 3 right jabs, followed by a left hook, and three right jabs, all to the face. Alice blocked the last few, after being hit by the first few. Alice tried to juke Mugman by winding up a left hook, only to throw a right jab. Mugman didn’t fall for it though, dodging the right jab, before mollywhopping Alice in the face, sending her into the ropes of the ring. Alice relaxed for a minute, before pushing back on the ropes, sending herself flying into Mugman. Alice threw a flurry of punches at Mugman, with some landing, and some being blocked. Mugman threw a right hook at the same time Alice also threw a right hook, leaving them at a temporary standstill. “You’re good. You’ve been practicing?”, Alice asked sarcastically. “You know, I’m something of an athlete myself.”, Mugman answered, before following a jab that lasted for 0.01 seconds. Alice was sent back by the jab, both surprised and injured. Alice let herself fall down to avoid another jab by Mugman, before catching her self, and pushing herself back up to land a left hook on Mugman. Mugman was sent back, but caught himself on the rings ropes. Mugman dodged a punch to the face, and rapidly punched Alice in the stomach, before landing on uppercut. Alice fell down, but quickly got up to avoid losing. “I gotta dodge his punches for a while, until I can regain my stamina.”, Alice thought, dodging a jab from Mugman. Mugman slowed his jabs, trying to predict where she would dodge. But as Mugman tried to land another punch, he reimbursed the words of his sensei. “Don’t let your strength define you. Let your choices define who you are.”, Mugman thought, imaging his sensei fighting by his side. Mugman landed multiple punches and labs on Alice, and with landing the final blow, Alice was done. But, as Alice accepted her defeat, she felt something catch her by the collar. It was Mugman. “Stand still for ten seconds.”, Mugman instructed. Alice, in a daze, didn’t answer, but just stood there. Mugman walked over to one of the corners of the ring, and began to smash his head in. “He…he’s…he’s trying to initiate a tie…”, Alice thought, as she felt her legs become numb. And with the last blow to Mugmans head, both of the contestants fell to the floor, bruised and battered. The domain fell, and the two received their betted items back, not enhanced. Mugman used his Reversed Cursed Technique to heal his injuries, with Alice doing the same. “Why?”, Alice asked. “You had me on the final thread. Why give it up? Why give up ten times the energy you have now? Why give up the best statistics in jujutsu history?”, Alice asked, genuinely curious. “A wise person once told me that your strength doesn’t define who you are. It’s your choices. My strength is defined by my choices, and my choices defined me. I know what power can do to a person. It isn’t pretty. I didn’t want either of us to become absorbed by power, and do something risky that might chance the future maybe fifty, or a hundred years later. The future I want to make is the future that will become. A better world.”, Mugman said. Alice got up, dusting herself off. “Most sorcerers I know would’ve taken that chance and stomped my face in. But…you’re different. You’re the most respectable sorcerer I know now.”, Alice said, extending out her hand this time. “I’m Alice. Special Grade Sorcerer.”, Alice said with a smile on her face. Mugman shook her hand. “Mugman Grace, Second Grade Sorcerer.”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “So…uh…how did it go…?”, Bendy asked, looking at the two worried that one of them won. “It was a tie. And Alice is coming along with us.”, Mugman said. Alice confirmed, saying, “True dat.” “Alright, well, let’s head back to Tokyo. Our sensei is waiting to give us our next mission.”, Cuphead said, eating a chocolate stick. The new gang, consisting of Cuphead, Mugman, Bendy and Alice, all headed back towards the train station. We then cut to Tokyo, five hours later. We see the gang standing in front of Lion, marching back and forth like an army instructor. “Alright, guys. Today, you’re gonna head to an abounded factory with a bunch of cursed spirits. Two things: One, this might be a possible location of Jules finger. And two…”, Lion said, before continuing. “This might be a hideout of a sorcerer that went rogue 7 years ago. So, be on the lookout.”, Lion said. Most of the group just shrugged it off, but Mugman didn’t. Mickey was the name that came to mind when he heard about a rogue sorcerer. “We got it, sensei.”, they all said in unison. And with that, they set off. 4 hours later, they arrive. “Alright, here’s the plan. Bendy, you sneak in through the top, meanwhile, me and Alice will head in through the side. Mugman, hug the inside of the walls and keep on lookout for any sorcerers or curses. Got it, gang?”, Cuphead said. “Ahem. I believe that I’m the highest graded sorcerer, Cuphead.”, Alice said jokingly. “Shut up, Alice.”, Cuphead said. “Okay, Move out.”, Cuphead ordered, before everyone dashed so fast that they disappeared. Mugman cleared the outside, and reported, “no one outback. Red lobster, what do you see on the bottom floor with Wonder Woman?”, “Mugman, what are you talking about?”, Cuphead asked, genuinely confused. “Oh, I’m using code name! 8m Blue Jay, your Red Lobster, Alice is Wonder Woman, and Bendy is Lil’ Devil!”, Mugman said. “Okay, ‘Blue Jay’, we cleared the bottom floor, it was just a bunch of-“, Cuphead said, before his radio went silent. We see a sword go through Cupheads radio. “If I had practiced a little more, I would’ve pinned you to the wall.”, a mysterious figure said behind them. Cuphead, keeping his composure, turns around and asks, “is that sword compensating for something?” The mysterious figure smirks, and answers, “No, actually. It’s antique. old. And has a rope attached to it.”, as he pulls the sword back, cutting Cuphead on the nose. Alice then turns towards the figure. “Who even are you?”, Alice asks. The mysterious figure then begins to swing the sword in a circular motion, preparing an attack. “Why would I tell you that?”, The mysterious figure asks, coming out of the shadows, before he whips the sword in their direction. Cuphead and Alice ready their Cursed Techniques. “So that we can call you names while rubbing your face in the dirt.”, Alice says. The mysterious figure finally reveals himself to be Mickey. “Alright then. Let’s see if your sensei taught you well.”, Mickey says, before he swings his sword. Cuphead and Alice go on defense, staying back to back. Mickey then swings down from above, seemingly teleporting. “How come I can’t sense his cursed energy?”, Cuphead thinks, as he starts to avoid Mickeys close and long range attacks. Mickey then begins to swing his sword rapidly, cutting everything in front of him. “ALICE! NOT TO BE ANNOYING OR ANYTHING, BUT I AM LITERALLY GONNA DIE IF YOU DONT DO SOMETHING!”, Cuphead yelled, narrowing avoiding his head getting chopped off. Alice then summons a deck of cards, and throws them at Mickey. Mickey dashes again, this time in front of Alice. “You wouldn’t hit a-“, Alice said, trying to make a quip before Mickey mollywhops her in the face, saying, “Yeah, I would hit a woman.” Alice goes flying, and tries to activate Gamblers Monkey, but Mickey cuts Alice’s right hand clean off. Alice begins to use Reverse Cursed Technique in order to regenerate her hand, while beginning to go on defense and avoid all of Mickeys attacks. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Mugman crashes through the window. Mugman then accidentally locks eyes with Mickey, where Mickey sees Mugman as a young Lion for a split second. Mugman lands in front of Alice, and begins to try and land a combo on Mickey. Mickey quickly remembers this combo. “Oh, this is Lions. So, Lion taught these kids jujutsu, huh? Alright then. Lucky me, since he taught me these moves too. And how to counter them.”, Mickey thinks, as he blocks Mugmans combo. Mickey backs up, and sees Mugman, Cuphead and Alice in front of him. “So, if it isn’t Lions students. He’s been busy, huh? Training the next generation of sorcerers to fight his battles.”, Mickey says, engaging in banter with the trio. “Mickey, listen. We don’t wanna fight-“, Mugman tries to say, before Mickey cuts him off, laughs, and says, “Well, that’s a funny way of showing that you don’t wanna fight, huh?” Mugman frowns, and Cuphead steps up. “Whatever we do, we don’t wanna fight you. We just need some help.”, Cuphead says. “Help? Help you? Help the very institution I left? Help Lion? You all are as stubborn as he is. You kids don’t know how to make the best change in this world. Lion certainly didn’t.”, Mickey retorts, pointing out his sword. Mugman replied, “Mickey, please. Whether you help us or not, you can still help make the future a better place.” “You wanna know something very interesting? You sound JUST like him. You sound like Lion. Always thinking that there is another way. Without murder. Always talking about more options, and more chances. News Flash, Lion Jr., the world doesn’t work like that.”, Mickey said, tightening his grip on his sword. “Mickey, you once believed in changing the world, just like us. Maybe our way isn’t perfect, but it’s a start. Help us make it better.”, Mugman said. Mickey lowered his sword, and looked at Mugman. “I’m not promising anything, but I guess I’ll hear you guys out.”, Mickey said. Just then, Mickey coughed up some blood. Mickey then fell to one knee. “Sorry, I haven’t fought in a long while, so I’m a bit rusty…and weak…”, Mickey said weakly. “Oh, wait, here.”, Mugman said, finally letting his guard down and healing Mickey. Mickey is then healed back to full health and energy. “Thanks…”, Mickey said. “Hey…do you remember how I said I’d hear you out?”, Mickey asked with one eye open. Mugman looked at Mickey with a little confusion. Suddenly, within the blink of an eye, Mugman feels him arm fall of, followed by the COMPLETE ANNIHILATION OF THE BUILDING, AND LEAVING THE RUBBLE TO FALL ON THE GROUP. “I lied.”, Mickey stated, before putting his sword away. “Alright, now that I’m done with the three stooges, I can-“, Mickey stated, before he felt a sword swing, and cut the rope on his sword. “You said three stooges, right? Larry, Curly and Moe. Well, there was actually four. You just forgot the last one.”, Bendy said, holding his and Bendys sword. “Shemp.”, Bendy added. “Huh. Another sorcerer. Well, I guess it’s true what they say, monkeys travel in groups. It’s not often that I get to wipe the floor with jujutsu sorcerers. Let alone, three. So four should break my record.”, Mickey said, pulling out an alternate version of EWF. “You talk a lot. You kiss your mother with that mouth?”, Bendy said, preparing both swords. Mickey retorted, saying, “I killed my mother seven years ago.”, before he gets into his stance. “Yeesh, mommy issues, huh?”, Bendy asked. “I feel ya there.”, Bendy continued. “Really? Well then, I wonder what else you feel. Maybe pain?”, Mickey said, continuing the banter between them. Mickey then dashed towards Bendy. Bendy dodged, before he tried to slice Mickeys neck. Mickey blocked it and then kicked Bendy in the gut, sending him into a nearby field. “Oh, yeah. I have to use that fire technique if I wanna complete that to-do list.”, Bendy said, just now remembering something. “Fire…technique?”, Mickey asked. “Yeah, it’s something anyone can learn, that’s why it’s unique, and also, almost no sorcerer knows about it.”, Bendy said.","output":"Mickey, intrigued but cautious, kept a distance from Bendy, his eyes narrowing. \\"Show me then. This \'fire technique\' of yours.\\" Bendy smirked, slowly getting up to his feet, dusting off his clothes. \\"It\'s called \'Inferno\'s Waltz.\' And trust me, it\'s a literal blast.\\" Bendy\'s cursed energy began to morph, shifting its color to a vibrant, fiery red. Mickey watched, impressed but still on guard. Bendy then started to dance, a strange, almost ritualistic series of movements that were oddly graceful. As he moved, the ground beneath him caught fire, not a normal fire but one that seemed to be made of cursed energy itself. Mickey found himself oddly mesmerized by the dance, his guard lowering ever so slightly. \\"That\'s pretty... impressive,\\" Mickey admitted, though gritting his teeth, knowing he had to counter it. He readied his sword, the blade shimmering with its own dark cursed energy. But before he could strike, Bendy finished his dance with a sweeping motion, directing a wave of the cursed fire straight at Mickey. Mickey leaped, avoiding the brunt of the attack, but not without sustaining a minor burn. \\"Clever move,\\" he said, grinning despite the pain. \\"But let\'s see how you deal with my counterattack.\\" As the battle raged on between Mickey and Bendy, the others were slowly pulling themselves from the rubble. Mugman, his arm reattached thanks to some quick healing from Bendy before he engaged Mickey, helped Cuphead and Alice to their feet. \\"We need to stop them,\\" Mugman said, watching Bendy and Mickey clash with a mixture of awe and worry. Alice, her eyes sharp, nodded. \\"We need a plan. If we attack all at once, we might overwhelm him.\\" Cuphead, wiping blood from his nose, looked determined. \\"We can\'t let Bendy fight him alone. Mickey\'s too dangerous.\\" They waited, watching for an opening. Suddenly, Mickey, distracted by his duel with Bendy, left his flank exposed. Seizing the moment, Mugman charged forward, his cursed technique ready. \\"Dismantle!\\" he shouted, aiming a precise strike at Mickey. Mickey, caught off guard, barely managed to dodge, but Mugman\'s attack clipped him, sending him staggering. Alice and Cuphead used the opportunity to launch their combined attacks, forcing Mickey into a defensive stance. Surrounded and outnumbered, Mickey realized his defeat was imminent. With a swift movement, he performed a cursed technique that created a smokescreen, obscuring everyone\'s vision. When the smoke cleared, Mickey was gone. Catching their breaths, the group looked around, the tension slowly dissipating. \\"He escaped,\\" Mugman said, his voice mixed with frustration and relief. Bendy sheathed his swords, offering a wry smile. \\"He\'ll think twice before crossing paths with us again.\\" Lion, having arrived unnoticed during the final moments of the confrontation, clapped slowly. \\"Impressive teamwork, but let\'s not forget our primary objective. These encounters are only a part of the much larger war we\'re in.\\" The group, united by the recent ordeal, nodded in agreement, their resolve only strengthened. \\"Let\'s head back and plan our next move,\\" Lion suggested, leading them away from the remnants of battle. \\"We\'ve got a world to save, one cursed spirit at a time.\\" And with renewed purpose, they followed Lion, ready for whatever challenges lay ahead, knowing that the path to changing the world was filled with obstacles, but with teamwork and determination, they\'d face them head-on."},{"instruction":"Wie beschreibt der Absatz die Rolle von Lebensmitteln?

Below are examples of how to calculate MA, EMA, and SMA using the \\"talib\\" library (assuming \\"ralib\\" was a typo and you meant \\"talib\\", which is a widely used library for technical analysis indicators). If \\"ralib\\" was indeed your target, I apologize for the confusion, but it\'s less common and not recognized in the standard Python ecosystem for finance as of my last update. The examples assume you have historical price data in a Pandas DataFrame called `data` with a column named \'Close\' that contains the closing prices. First, ensure you have \\"talib\\" installed. If not, install it using pip: ```bash pip install TA-Lib ``` Here\'s how you could calculate the Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and a generic Moving Average (MA) using the TA-Lib: ```python import talib import pandas as pd import numpy as np # Assuming \'data\' is a Pandas DataFrame with your historical data and \'Close\' is the column with closing prices. close_prices = data[\'Close\'] # Simple Moving Average (SMA) with a time period of, for example, 30 days sma = talib.SMA(close_prices, timeperiod=30) data[\'SMA_30\'] = sma # Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with a time period of, for example, 30 days ema = talib.EMA(close_prices, timeperiod=30) data[\'EMA_30\'] = ema # Moving Average (MA), let\'s calculate a simple moving average as an example. # TA-Lib supports several types of moving averages, such as SMA, EMA, WMA (Weighted MA), and more. # We\'ll use SMA here as an example. ma = talib.MA(close_prices, timeperiod=30, matype=0) # matype=0 for SMA. You can change matype for other types of MAs. data[\'MA_30\'] = ma print(data[[\'SMA_30\', \'EMA_30\', \'MA_30\']].head()) ``` This code will add `SMA_30`, `EMA_30`, and `MA_30` columns to your `data` DataFrame, each representing the 30-day SMA, EMA, and a generic MA calculated from the closing prices, respectively. For the generic `MA`, `matype` can be adjusted to use different types of moving averages, such as SMA (`matype=0`), EMA (`matype=1`), WMA (`matype=2`), etc. Refer to the TA-Lib documentation for more `matype` options and details."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Моё утро началось немного иначе, чем обычно. Впервые за долгое время я проснулся не от звонка будильника, а от лучей солнца, пробивающихся сквозь шторы моей комнаты. Отсутствие телефона чувствовалось как некая пустота, но с другой стороны, это дарило свободу и ощущение легкости. Завтрак я завершил несколько быстрее, не отвлекаясь на проверку уведомлений и просмотр ленты новостей. Как странно осознавать, что у меня появилось больше времени на размышления, на наслаждение едой и даже на небольшую беседу с членами семьи, которые казались удивленными такому неожиданному вниманию. Решив не дать дню пройти даром, я отправился на прогулку. Это была идеальная возможность заметить простые вещи, которые часто ускользают от нашего внимания из-за постоянного погружения в виртуальный мир. Шелест листьев, играющие в лучах солнца тени, даже звуки города, которые ранее казались не более чем фоном, теперь наполняли моменты уникальными ощущениями. По возвращении домой я решил почитать книгу, которую откладывал на потом из-за недостатка времени. Страницы заполнялись образами и событиями, а я смог окунуться в историю глубже, не отвлекаясь на частые уведомления и звонки. Чтение прерывалось только звуками чайника и приятной усталостью от прогулки. Вечер я провел с семьей. Мы играли в настольные игры, разговаривали и смеялись гораздо чаще и искреннее, чем в привычные дни. Каждый из нас был настолько поглощен общением, что отсутствие телефона уже не воспринималось как потеря. Это было скорее обретением чего-то истинно важного и ценного: времени, внимания и взаимной заботы. Перед сном я задумался о прожитом дне. Не могу сказать, что готов полностью отказаться от телефона, ведь он несет и полезные функции. Однако этот день без телефона позволил мне понять важность умеренности и контроля над тем, сколько времени и внимания я уделяю цифровому миру. Этот день напомнил мне о простых человеческих радостях, о ценности момента и о том, как много может предложить реальный мир за пределами экрана."},{"instruction":"55 years old female with grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma. Triple negative and ki67 70%","output":"A 55-year-old female with a diagnosis of grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) that is triple-negative and has a Ki-67 index of 70% presents a challenging but not uncommon clinical scenario in breast cancer management. Here, we examine the implications of each of these characteristics and consider potential treatment strategies: # 1. **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (Grade 3):** IDC is the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for about 70-80% of all cases. The grade of the tumor (in this case, grade 3) is determined by how much the cancer cells differ from healthy cells. A grade 3 designation indicates that the cells are poorly differentiated, meaning they look significantly different from normal cells and tend to grow and spread more aggressively. # 2. **Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC):** Triple-negative breast cancer refers to the absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) on the cancer cells. This makes TNBC more challenging to treat, as hormone therapy and drugs that target HER2 are not effective. TNBC tends to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer, is more likely to recur, and often has a worse prognosis. # 3. **Ki-67 Index of 70%:** The Ki-67 protein is a marker used to measure cell proliferation. A Ki-67 index of 70% indicates a high proportion of the cancer cells are growing and dividing, suggesting a more aggressive tumor. High Ki-67 levels are often associated with a poorer prognosis and may influence treatment decisions. # Treatment Approaches: Surgery: Surgery is often the first-line treatment for breast cancer, involving either a lumpectomy (removing the tumor and a small margin of surrounding tissue) or mastectomy (removing one or both breasts, partially or entirely), depending on the extent of the cancer and patient preference. Chemotherapy: Given the aggressive nature of high-grade, triple-negative, and high-Ki-67 cancers, chemotherapy is a central part of treatment. It may be administered before surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) to shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove or after surgery (adjuvant chemotherapy) to eliminate any remaining cancer cells. Radiation Therapy: Radiation therapy is commonly employed after surgery, especially after a lumpectomy, to target any residual tumor cells in the breast or chest wall and reduce the risk of recurrence. Immunotherapy: For some cases of TNBC, especially those that are locally advanced or metastatic, immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy may be considered. This approach can help the body\'s immune system to identify and destroy cancer cells. Clinical Trials: Given the aggressive nature of this breast cancer type, participation in clinical trials may be encouraged. These can provide access to cutting-edge treatments and therapies that are not yet widely available. # Follow-up and Support: Regular follow-up care is crucial for monitoring response to treatment, managing side effects, and detecting any signs of recurrence early. Supportive care, including nutritional support, physical rehabilitation, and counseling, can also play an important role in the patient\'s overall well-being during and after treatment. Each patient\'s treatment plan is tailored to their specific situation. The patient should discuss with their oncology team the most appropriate treatment options based on the characteristics of their cancer and their personal preferences."},{"instruction":"What is the best and the worst scenarios in this case","output":"For a 55-year-old female with grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma that is triple-negative and has a Ki-67 index of 70%, both best and worst-case scenarios draw heavily from the unique characteristics of her diagnosis. It\'s essential to remember that individual responses to treatment can vary significantly, and the outlook can be influenced by multiple factors, including overall health, the extent of cancer (stage), the effectiveness of treatment, and how the cancer responds to treatment. # Best-Case Scenario In the best-case scenario, the cancer would be limited to the breast and possibly the nearby lymph nodes but not spread to distant parts of the body (i.e., it is at an early stage). The patient would undergo successful surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy, effectively eliminating cancer cells from the body. The treatment would result in complete remission, meaning there is no detectable cancer left, and the patient would experience no significant adverse side effects from the treatments. During the follow-up period, regular monitoring through physical examinations, mammograms, and other scans as needed, would show no signs of cancer recurrence. In this scenario, although the patient would have to live with the awareness of the possibility of cancer recurrence, their quality of life would remain good, and they would be considered cancer-free. # Worst-Case Scenario In the worst-case scenario, the cancer might be detected at a later stage where it has spread beyond the breast and nearby lymph nodes to other parts of the body (metastatic breast cancer). Triple-negative breast cancer can be particularly aggressive and challenging to treat, especially in cases with a high Ki-67 index indicating rapid cancer cell growth. Despite aggressive treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and potentially immunotherapy, the cancer might not respond well to treatment or could recur after an initial response. In such cases, the focus of care might shift towards palliative treatments aimed at managing symptoms and maintaining the quality of life, rather than trying to cure the cancer. Patients with metastatic cancer may experience a range of symptoms depending on the extent and locations of the spread, including pain, fatigue, and other specific symptoms related to organ involvement. The prognosis in such advanced cases is generally poor, and treatment aims to extend life as much as possible while focusing on the patient\'s comfort and preferences. # Conclusion It is crucial for patients and their families to have open and honest discussions with their healthcare team about the potential outcomes, treatment options, and individual goals for care. Advances in cancer research are ongoing, and new treatments that could potentially change the course of the disease are continuously being explored in clinical trials. Participation in such trials might offer additional options for some patients. Regardless of the scenario, support from a multidisciplinary team, including medical professionals, social workers, and mental health providers, can be invaluable in helping patients and their families navigate the challenges of diagnosis, treatment, and beyond."},{"instruction":"Is time to start treatment is important","output":"Yes, the timing of treatment initiation is very important in the management of invasive breast cancer, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with a high Ki-67 index like in the scenario you described. The urgency and timing can significantly impact the outcomes of treatment. Here\'s why: # 1. **Disease Progression** - **Aggressive Nature of TNBC:** Triple-negative breast cancer tends to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer. This means it can grow and spread more quickly. A high Ki-67 index further indicates that a large proportion of the cancer cells are in the process of dividing. Delaying treatment gives such aggressive cancer more opportunity to advance to a later stage, possibly metastasizing to distant parts of the body, which can limit treatment options and decrease the likelihood of remission. # 2. **Treatment Effectiveness** - **Early Intervention:** Starting treatment promptly increases the chances of controlling the cancer, achieving remission, and potentially curing it. Early-stage cancers are generally more responsive to treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In the context of TNBC, where hormonal therapies are not an option due to the lack of hormone receptors, chemotherapy is a primary treatment modality. The effectiveness of chemotherapy and other treatments may decrease as the cancer advances. # 3. **Survival Rates** - **Impact on Outcomes:** Numerous studies have shown that earlier treatment initiation, especially for aggressive breast cancers, is associated with better outcomes and survival rates. Delays in starting treatment can lead to a significant impact on the prognosis. # 4. **Quality of Life** - **Symptom Management:** Beginning treatment without undue delay can also help manage symptoms more effectively, potentially improving the patient’s quality of life. Advanced cancer can cause significant symptoms and complications, making early action beneficial. # 5. **Psychological Impact** - **Anxiety and Uncertainty:** For many patients, the period between diagnosis and the start of treatment is filled with anxiety and uncertainty. Initiating treatment can provide a sense of proactiveness and control, which may be psychologically beneficial. # Planning for Treatment It\'s important for patients and their healthcare team to expediently discuss the diagnosis, treatment options, and plans. However, the need for speed does not mean that important steps should be skipped. Proper staging of the cancer, comprehensive health evaluation, and planning of a personalized treatment strategy are critical and should be performed meticulously but efficiently. # Conclusion For aggressive breast cancers, such as triple-negative cancer with a high Ki-67 index, timely initiation of treatment is crucial. It is associated with better disease outcomes and can significantly influence the overall prognosis and quality of life. Patients should work closely with their oncology team to ensure no unnecessary delays in starting treatment while ensuring a thorough diagnostic and planning phase."},{"instruction":"Wie beschreibt der Absatz die Rolle von Lebensmitteln?

Они генерируют значения на лету и не хранят их в памяти. Таким образом, они очень эффективны для работы с большими объемами данных, когда нежелательно или невозможно хранить все данные в памяти. Генератор можно создать двумя способами: 1. Используя функцию с ключевым словом `yield` 2. Используя генераторные выражения (аналогично list comprehensions, но используются круглые скобки вместо квадратных) # Способ 1: Используя функцию с `yield` Ключевое слово `yield` используется в функции вместо `return`. Функция возвращает генератор, который можно итерировать. При каждой итерации Python возвращает значение после `yield`, затем приостанавливает выполнение функции (сохраняя все значения переменных), и возобновляет выполнение с того же места при следующем вызове. ```python def my_generator(): n = 1 print(\'This is printed first\') yield n n += 1 print(\'This is printed second\') yield n n += 1 print(\'This is printed at last\') yield n # Создание генератора a = my_generator() # Получение значений из генератора print(next(a)) # This is printed first # 1 print(next(a)) # This is printed second # 2 print(next(a)) # This is printed at last # 3 ``` # Способ 2: Используя генераторные выражения Генераторные выражения создаются посредством использования синтаксиса, похожего на list comprehensions, но вместо квадратных скобок используются круглые. Это компактный способ создания генераторов. ```python # Генераторное выражение my_gen = (x*x for x in range(3)) # Итерация через генератор for x in my_gen: print(x) # Вывод: # 0 # 1 # 4 ``` Генераторы в Python очень полезны для работы с потоками данных, которые слишком велики, чтобы помещаться целиком в памяти. Они позволяют обрабатывать элементы последовательно, при этом значительно экономя ресурсы."},{"instruction":"типы итераторов python","output":"В Python итераторы представляют собой объекты, которые позволяют вам перебирать элементы коллекции (например, список, кортеж, строку) или любые другие итерируемые объекты. Основные концепции, связанные с итераторами, включают понятия итерируемых объектов и самих итераторов. Давайте более подробно рассмотрим типы итераторов и связанные с ними понятия. # Итерируемые объекты (Iterable) Итерируемый объект — это объект, который способен возвращать элементы по одному. Вы можете перебирать элементы итерируемого объекта, используя цикл `for`. Примеры итерируемых объектов включают все встроенные типы коллекций, такие как списки, кортежи, множества и словари, а также строки. # Итераторы (Iterator) Итератор — это объект, который реализует протокол итератора, который состоит из методов `__iter__()` и `__next__()`. Метод `__iter__()` возвращает сам итератор, а `__next__()` возвращает следующий элемент коллекции. Если элементы в коллекции заканчиваются, `__next__()` должен вызвать исключение `StopIteration`. Чтобы получить итератор из итерируемого объекта, используется функция `iter()`. Чтобы получить следующий элемент итератора, используется функция `next()`. # Генераторы (Generator) Генераторы — это упрощенный способ создания итераторов. Это функции, в которых вместо оператора `return` используется `yield`. Генераторы автоматически реализуют методы `__iter__()` и `__next__()`. При вызове генератора функция не выполняется немедленно; вместо этого она возвращает итератор, который управляет выполнением функции. # Итераторы файлов Файлы в Python также являются итерируемыми объектами. Вы можете перебирать строки файла, используя цикл `for` напрямую на объекте файла. # Итераторы бесконечных последовательностей Python поддерживает создание бесконечных итераторов, которые не вызывают исключение `StopIteration`. В модуле `itertools` имеется несколько таких итераторов, включая `count()`, `cycle()` и `repeat()`. # Пользовательские итераторы Вы можете создавать собственные итераторы, определяя классы с методами `__iter__()` и `__next__()`. Это позволяет создавать объекты, которые могут быть использованы в цикле `for` или в любом другом контексте, предназначенном для итерации. # Заключение Итераторы в Python — это мощный инструмент, который позволяет лаконично и эффективно обрабатывать элементы коллекций и другие последовательности данных. Они лежат в основе многих аспектов Python, включая циклы, генераторы и сопрограммы."},{"instruction":"другие примеры итераторов в python","output":"Python предоставляет богатый набор встроенных итераторов, которые помогают работать с последовательностями данных и потоками. В дополнение к уже обсужденному, давайте рассмотрим несколько других примеров итераторов и итерируемых объектов, которые доступны в Python, обеспечивая более широкий контекст использования этих фундаментальных концепций. # Итераторы из модуля itertools Модуль `itertools` предлагает коллекцию итераторов, предназначенных для эффективной работы с итерируемыми объектами. Ниже приведены некоторые из самых полезных итераторов, предоставляемых этим модулем: - `itertools.count(start=0, step=1)`: создает бесконечный итератор, который начинает с `start` и продолжается с заданным шагом `step`. - `itertools.cycle(iterable)`: повторяет элементы из итерируемого объекта, создавая бесконечный цикл. - `itertools.repeat(object[, times])`: повторяет объект либо бесконечное количество раз, либо указанное количество раз, если аргумент `times` задан. - `itertools.chain(*iterables)`: объединяет несколько итерируемых в один итератор. - `itertools.islice(iterable, start, stop[, step])`: создает итератор, который возвращает выбранные элементы из итерируемого объекта, начиная с `start`, заканчивая `stop`, с опциональным шагом `step`. - `itertools.permutations(iterable, r=None)`: возвращает последовательные перестановки длины `r` из элементов `iterable`. - `itertools.combinations(iterable, r)`: создает итератор, возвращающий все возможные комбинации элементов `iterable` длиной `r`. # Итераторы строк, списков, словарей и множеств В Python вы можете напрямую итерировать по элементам базовых структур данных: - **Строки** и **Списки**: можно итерировать по каждому символу или элементу соответственно. - **Словари**: можно итерировать по ключам, значениям или ключ-значение парам. - `.keys()` возвращает итератор ключей; - `.values()` возвращает итератор значений; - `.items()` возвращает итератор пар ключ-значение. - **Множества**: как и списки, но без дубликатов и без сохранения порядка элементов. # Пользовательские итераторы Кроме того, вы можете создавать пользовательские итераторы, определив классы с методами `__iter__` и `__next__`: ```python class Count: def __init__(self, low, high): self.current = low self.high = high def __iter__(self): return self def __next__(self): if self.current > self.high: raise StopIteration else: self.current += 1 return self.current - 1 # Пример использования for number in Count(3, 8): print(number) ``` Этот пример создает пользовательский итератор, который подсчитывает от `low` до `high`. Подобным образом можно создавать итераторы для любых пользовательских потребностей, опираясь на специфические требования к обработке целых данных или алгоритмов. # Заключение Итераторы и итерируемые объекты являются ключевыми элементами Python, облегчающими создание чистого, лаконичного и эффективного кода для обработки коллекций данных. Зная разнообразие доступных в Python итераторов и умея создавать собственные, разработчик может выбирать наиболее подходящий инструмент для решения конкретной задачи."},{"instruction":"цикл for in это итератор в python ?","output":"Цикл `for` в Python использует понятие итераторов для перебора элементов итерируемых объектов, таких как списки, кортежи, словари, множества, строки и другие. Таким образом, он напрямую связан с концепцией итераторов, но сам по себе не является итератором. Вместо этого, цикл `for` обращается к итератору, который получен из итерируемого объекта, и последовательно получает от него элементы до тех пор, пока не будет достигнут конец последовательности или не будет вызвано исключение `StopIteration`. Когда вы пишете цикл `for` в Python, например: ```python for item in my_iterable: # do something with item ``` Python автоматически вызывает функцию `iter()` для `my_iterable` для получения итератора. Затем, на каждой итерации цикла, Python вызывает функцию `next()` для итератора, чтобы получить следующий элемент. Когда итератор исчерпывает все элементы, он генерирует исключение `StopIteration`, которое сигнализирует циклу `for` остановиться. Важно отметить, что этот процесс происходит автоматически и скрыто от пользователя. Вот пример того, как можно реализовать базовый процесс итерации, который выполняет цикл `for` \\"под капотом\\", с использованием явного создания итератора и вызова функции `next()`: ```python my_iterable = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] iterator = iter(my_iterable) # Получаем итератор while True: try: item = next(iterator) # Получаем следующий элемент print(item) # Делаем что-то с элементом except StopIteration: # Когда элементы закончатся break # Выходим из цикла ``` Этот пример демонстрирует, как цикл `for` использует итераторы для перебора элементов, но в более \\"ручном\\" режиме. Такой подход редко используется в повседневном программировании на Python, поскольку цикл `for` значительно упрощает этот процесс, делая код более читаемым и понятным."},{"instruction":"что делает next в примере выше ?","output":"В приведенном выше примере функция `next()` используется для получения следующего элемента от итератора. Каждый раз, когда функция `next()` вызывается на итераторе, она возвращает последовательно следующий элемент итерируемой последовательности. После возвращения элемента, положение в итераторе перемещается вперед, так что при следующем вызове `next()` будет возвращен следующий элемент. Важные аспекты работы функции `next()`: 1. **Получение элементов:** `next()` автоматически обращается к следующему элементу в итераторе и возвращает его. 2. **Состояние итератора:** Итератор сохраняет свое текущее состояние (то есть, на каком элементе он остановился), так что повторные вызовы `next()` продолжают возвращать последующие элементы итерируемого объекта. 3. **Исключение StopIteration:** Когда итератор достигает конца итерируемой последовательности и больше не имеет элементов для возврата, `next()` вызывает исключение `StopIteration`. Это исключение используется для сигнализации о том, что итерация завершилась. В примере кода, приведенном выше, это исключение используется в блоке `try-except` для выхода из бесконечного цикла `while`, когда итерация по всем элементам закончится. Пример работы `next()` на основе примера из предыдущего сообщения: ```python my_iterable = [1, 2, 3] iterator = iter(my_iterable) # Создаем итератор из списка print(next(iterator)) # Выводит: 1 print(next(iterator)) # Выводит: 2 print(next(iterator)) # Выводит: 3 # Попытка получить следующий элемент вызовет исключение StopIteration, # так как элементы в итераторе закончились try: print(next(iterator)) except StopIteration: print(\\"Итерация завершилась.\\") ``` Таким образом, `next()` играет ключевую роль в механизме итерации в Python, позволяя последовательно обрабатывать элементы итерируемых объектов."},{"instruction":"пример итерации set python","output":"Множества в Python (`set`) являются неупорядоченными коллекциями уникальных элементов. Вы можете итерировать по множеству точно так же, как и по другим коллекциям, используя цикл `for`. Вот простой пример, показывающий, как можно итерировать по множеству: ```python my_set = {3, 1, 4, 2, 5} for item in my_set: print(item) ``` В этом примере создается множество `my_set` с пятью элементами. После этого цикл `for` итерирует по множеству, и на каждой итерации переменная `item` будет содержать один из элементов множества. Каждый элемент будет напечатан в консоль. Важно отметить, что множества в Python являются неупорядоченными. Это означает, что элементы могут быть возвращены в произвольном порядке при итерации, и порядок их возвращения может отличаться от порядка, в котором элементы были добавлены в множество. Таким образом, порядок вывода элементов в примере выше не гарантирован. Также стоит учесть, что, несмотря на неупорядоченность, итерация по множеству остается эффективным и удобным способом доступа ко всем его элементам. Это делает множества очень полезными для операций, связанных с уникальностью элементов, например, для удаления дубликатов из списка: ```python my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5] unique_elements = set(my_list) for element in unique_elements: print(element) ``` Здесь сначала список `my_list` преобразуется в множество `unique_elements`, что автоматически удаляет все дублирующиеся элементы. Затем можно итерировать по множеству `unique_elements` для доступа к уникальным элементам исходного списка."},{"instruction":"пример list и count python","output":"Давайте рассмотрим пример использования метода `count()` на списках (list) в Python. Метод `count()` используется для подсчета количества вхождений определенного элемента в список. ```python # Создаем список чисел numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1] # Подсчитываем, сколько раз число 1 встречается в списке count_1 = numbers.count(1) print(f\\"Число 1 встречается в списке {count_1} раз.\\") # Подсчитываем, сколько раз число 3 встречается в списке count_3 = numbers.count(3) print(f\\"Число 3 встречается в списке {count_3} раз.\\") # Создаем список строк words = [\'apple\', \'banana\', \'cherry\', \'apple\', \'cherry\', \'cherry\'] # Подсчитываем, сколько раз слово \'cherry\' встречается в списке count_cherry = words.count(\'cherry\') print(f\\"Слово \'cherry\' встречается в списке {count_cherry} раз.\\") ``` Этот пример демонстрирует использование метода `count()` для подсчета количества вхождений чисел `1` и `3` в список чисел, а также количество вхождений строки `\'cherry\'` в список слов. Метод `count()` очень полезен, когда вам необходимо быстро определить, сколько раз определенный элемент появляется в списке. Однако, стоит помнить, что метод `count()` перебирает весь список для подсчета, что может быть не самым эффективным подходом при работе с очень большими списками. В таких случаях стоит рассмотреть возможность использования других структур данных или подходов в зависимости от задачи."},{"instruction":"пример с itertools.count","output":"Функция `itertools.count` из модуля `itertools` в Python генерирует бесконечный итератор, который продолжает выдавать последовательные значения, начиная с указанного числа и (опционально) с заданным шагом. Этот итератор может быть полезен для генерации последовательных значений или для использования в качестве индекса в других операциях итерации. Вот простой пример использования `itertools.count`: ```python import itertools # Создадим итератор, который начнется с числа 10 и будет увеличиваться на 2 counter = itertools.count(10, 2) # Выведем первые 5 значений, сгенерированных counter for _ in range(5): print(next(counter)) ``` Выходные данные: ``` 10 12 14 16 18 ``` В этом примере `itertools.count(10, 2)` создает итератор, который начинается с `10` и увеличивается на `2` с каждым шагом. Используя цикл `for` с функцией `range(5)`, программа запрашивает (и выводит) первые пять значений из этого итератора посредством вызова функции `next(counter)`. Несмотря на то, что `itertools.count` генерирует бесконечную последовательность, важно ограничивать количество вызовов `next()` в вашем коде (например, используя `for` цикл с `range()` как выше), чтобы избежать бесконечного цикла, который никогда не завершится автоматически. Также `itertools.count()` может использоваться в сочетании с другими функциями и итераторами для достижения различных целей. Например, мы можем использовать его для присваивания уникальных идентификаторов элементам в списке: ```python import itertools # Список элементов items = [\'a\', \'b\', \'c\'] # Создание итератора count ids = itertools.count(1) # Начинаем с 1 # Присвоение уникального ID каждому элементу items_with_ids = [(next(ids), item) for item in items] print(items_with_ids) ``` Выходные данные: ``` [(1, \'a\'), (2, \'b\'), (3, \'c\')] ``` Здесь `itertools.count` используется для создания уникальных ID, начиная с `1`, для каждого элемента в списке `items`. Это всего лишь несколько примеров использования `itertools.count` для улучшения вашего кода и реализации конкретных поведений при работе с последовательностями в Python."},{"instruction":"объединение 2 списков в кортеж python","output":"Для объединения двух списков в кортежи в Python, вы можете использовать функцию `zip()`. Эта функция позволяет объединить элементы из двух (или более) итерируемых объектов по порядку, возвращая итератор из кортежей, где каждый кортеж содержит элементы введенных итерируемых объектов, стоящие на одинаковых позициях. Давайте рассмотрим пример, где у нас есть два списка, и мы хотим объединить их в список кортежей: ```python # Два исходных списка list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4] list2 = [\'a\', \'b\', \'c\', \'d\'] # Использование zip() для объединения списков в итератор кортежей zipped = zip(list1, list2) # Преобразование итератора в список кортежей для удобства вывода или дальнейшего использования result = list(zipped) print(result) ``` Вывод будет таким: ``` [(1, \'a\'), (2, \'b\'), (3, \'c\'), (4, \'d\')] ``` Каждый элемент в результирующем списке является кортежем, содержащим по одному элементу из обоих исходных списков, расположенных на соответствующих позициях. **Важное замечание**: Если списки имеют разную длину, `zip()` остановится на самом коротком списке, и лишние элементы в более длинном списке будут проигнорированы: ```python # Списки разной длины list1 = [1, 2, 3] list2 = [\'a\', \'b\', \'c\', \'d\', \'e\'] # Длиннее list1 zipped = zip(list1, list2) # Остановится на длине list1 result = list(zipped) print(result) # Выведет список кортежей, основанный на длине самого короткого списка (list1) ``` Вывод будет таким: ``` [(1, \'a\'), (2, \'b\'), (3, \'c\')] ``` Использование функции `zip()` является эффективным и элегантным способом для параллельной итерации по нескольким итерируемым объектам и объединения их элементов в кортежи."},{"instruction":"на какой cms сделан сайт https://7745.by/","output":"Извините, но к моменту моего последнего обновления знаний в апреле 2023 года я не имею доступа к интернету в реальном времени и, следовательно, не могу прямо сейчас проверить или анализировать текущие веб-сайты, чтобы определить, на какой CMS (системе управления содержимым) они работают.

Они анализируют технологии, используемые веб-сайтом, и могут предоставить вам информацию о CMS, хостинге, сервере и используемых плагинах. 3. **Соглашения о URL и структура ссылок**: Некоторые CMS имеют характерные пути URL или структуру ссылок. Например, по умолчанию WordPress использует структуру ссылок, которая может выглядеть так: `https://example.com/?p=123` или имеет папки типа `/wp-content/`. 4. **Специализированные запросы**: Для некоторых CMS можно попробовать ввести специализированные URL, которые могут выдать страницы логина или определенные файлы. Например, добавление `/admin`, `/login` или `/wp-admin` к URL может выявить интерфейс администратора WordPress. Помните, что некоторые сайты могут использовать кастомные решения или сильно модифицированные версии популярных CMS, что затрудняет их определение стандартными методами."},{"instruction":"развернутый ответ на вопрос: Национальные интересы и их учет в геополитике США. основываясь на: «Так что же делать? – постоянно спрашивает профессор В. Поляков, – Кому на Руси жить хорошо? Что такое «друзья народа», и как они воюют против социал-демократов? Как нам реорганизовать Рабкрин?» – Никогда не отвечаю на подобные вопросы, поскольку не верю, что кто-то не понимает роли социальных сетей в сегодняшней жизни. Впрочем, могу допустить, что многие как раз догадываются, но элементарно не умеют пользоваться этим мощным инструментом. Во-первых, информация. Ни один информационный сайт с кодлой тупых редакторов, не сравнится в оперативности с сетевым твитом. Да, здесь никто ничего не проверяет на подлинность, но возьмите, к примеру, какое-нибудь крупное информационное агентство, – чьи хозяева содержат свой весьма дорогостоящий ресурс исключительно в целях пропаганды, – какие он ещё рашает задачи, кроме тех, ради чего содержится? Комменты здесь Не думаю, что у них в приоритете достоверность информации, – смысл? Да и потом мы живём во времена, когда подлинно то, что релевантно. Именно в силу того, что среднестатистическая черепушка с большим трудом переваривает навалившийся на него огромный объём информации: что хочется – то и реально. И вы только прикиньте разницу в качестве ответа на тот или иной запрос между неповоротливой подцензурной спамерской машиной и тем же личным блогом. Да, у частника, как правило, нет инсайдеров во власти, но так ли уж многим действительно интересно, что там у них творится «за зубцами»? В конце концов, какую власть люди ожидают – такую им и выдадут в качестве образа. И если вы хотите только просматривать эти «весёлые картинки», как грицца, берегите ящик и не перепутайте каналы. А если перепутать? Действительно, что изменится, если мы вдруг запутаемся в телевизионных каналах? – Ровным счётом ничего. А вот на базе социальных сетей или персонального блога можно построить личный интерфейс к окружающему нас информационному пространству именно в силу интерактивности сетевых коммуникаций, чего полностью лишено радио и телевидение. И если телевизор, в основном, производит однозначно оценочную продукцию, – формируя положительное либо отрицательное отношение к предмету и, по сути, навязывает заданную и весьма конкретную повестку дня, – то в сети рулит так называемый «трафик», и здесь все предметы делятся на существующие и не существующие. Понимаете, да? То есть, сеть априори подразумевает активное отношение к информации вплоть до возможности самостоятельного производства событий или персональной модерации информационных потоков и коннотирования той или иной ситуации. То есть сеть позволяет, как минимум, построить своё персональное зеркало при условии, разумеется, достаточной «накаченности» вашего узла. Неужели этого мало? В любом случае, это ничто, если не игра, и всё зависит оттого, насколько успешно вы втяните публику в эту игру, например, на предмет перезагрузки действующей эрефийской системы. В тот момент, как я набираю эти буквы, боярская давла вошла в полосу глубокого пурпура и начала святиться инфернальным ультрафиолетом, так что момент выбран удачно. Тем не менее, надо хорошо себе представлять, что простая смена властного семейного пула отнюдь не приведёт страну к стато, и вся эта perezagruzka хотя и породит поначалу какие-то мелкие ништяки, но лет эдак через 25-30 всё начнётся заново и пойдёт по новому кругу. Ведь переход государственного режима от давлы к стато возможен лишь через фашизм – он же принудительный механизм конституирования гражданства и институтов власти, а вот в это-то как раз не очень верится, особенно сегодня, когда мир позиционирует себя как глобальная сеть. Или эти «национальные государства» – увы, они уходят в прошлое. И мы всё чаще видим, как религиозные или этнические общины играют роль спойлера для продвижения «чистой функции» без тех или иных протезов и индульгенций модерна. С этого и следует начинать игру, если действительно есть желание добиться цели. Но целью игры всегда является сама игра, – верно? И вопрос следующий: с кем играть? Ведь давла – это такая машина, где только две педали – тормоз и газ, педаль сцепления отсутствует. Собссна, причина, по которой цивилизация решила строить институты и жить по протоколу Закона, а не зависеть от частной воли «ручного управления». «У вас тут интересы, а мы здесь выживаем», – вот основная проблема боярской давлы, отрезающая все пути к интенсификации собственного узла и гарантирующая ей заведомо подчинённое положение в глобальном конкурентном диспозитиве. Позиция, сводимая ко всё той же роли спойлера – она же хрюшка, откармливаемая хозяином в качестве закуски на условное «рождество». И на любые запросы не из властного пула она не способна ответить ничем, кроме запретов и насилия. Причём, насилия «на всякий случай» в силу трогательной неспособности определить и понять смысл запроса. И тут необходимо добавить следующее. В отличие от арабской давлы, стремящейся к халифату, Эрефия, похоже, и была создана, чтобы продемонстрировать миру пример «отмирающего государства». То есть государства вообще. Аванпост Глобальной Левой, – витрина Коминтерна, оформленная в «евразийской» стилистике, – Россия так и не обрела подлинного суверенитета. Впрочем, не факт, что власть имущие к этому вообще когда-либо стремились. Именно отсюда идут все эти конспирологические теории про «всесильную» роль т.н. транснациональных корпораций (THK), живущих, де, вне интересов суверенов, хотя в реале дело обстоит ровным счётом наоборот: при смене оптики практически за любой ТНК весьма отчётливо виден ресурс, имплицитно накачивающий тот или иной суверенный узел, или, как сейчас принято выражаться – «крышу». Старо, как мир: «Если наш соломенный самолёт не взлетает, то где доказательства того, что у них самолёты тоже настоящие?»– Эффект обратного карго-культа, я его так называю: «Если Америка поднялась с того, что линчевала негров, почему бы нам не начать линчевать собственное население, – глядишь, и тоже поднимемся! И если транснациональные корпорации постоянно срут на интересы трудящих и не считаются ни с какими государственными суверенитетами, зачем рашке суверенитет – это, во-первых, а во-вторых, – не начать ли нам срать на самих себя и получить гарантии международной уважухи?»Это, как вы уже догадались, современные оналитеги-мудрецы, академики-панарины из орловских кагебешных ПТУ. Что на это ответить? Постинформационная, «сетевая» эпоха не просто «размыла» Левую Парадигму с её ставкой на унификацию и неразличимость. Она поставила на сегрегацию, поскольку открыла важнейший интенсификационный ресурс именно в плюральности и многообразии, конвертировав в глобальный сетевой диспозитив саму различимость, где значимость роли суверена увеличилась во много раз. Парадокс, но цена на Уникальное подскочила именно в тот момент, когда, казалось бы, похоронили Автора навсегда. Разумеется, ещё были те, кто надеялся на Маркса и его не менее бородатого любовника, но тут вдруг поняли, что этот маккиавелиевский этатизм, над которым смеялись эпигоны БородатыхЪ™, стал не только мощнейшим цивилизационным мотором, но и маркером самого западного превосходства. Ведь это лев может себе позволить сказать, что врагов у него нет, – а вы думали, «права человека» и прочее облизывание «меньшинств» происходят от романтической любви к ним? Скорее, наоборот, – от «аппетита». И в этом сетевом диспозитиве Эрефия сама зачем-то выставляет себя в качестве цели для ракет «здоровых сил мира» – а как ещё заставить обратить на себя внимание, с другой-то стороны? Однако тяга к «суккубу» Белого Человека всегда приводит к Холокосту™, и заинтересованные не дадут соврать: видите себя несчастными и гонимыми? Нет проблем, будете ими постоянно. Вам мешают агенты-цереу, окружили тройным-кольцом-врагов и воруют детей из детдомов, что вы держите в качестве сексуального материала для ваших же верхних? Нет проблем, расхуячим вашу «родину» ракетами без зазрения совести – превратим в реальность вашу сокровенную мечту. И всё снова, и как всегда: мечтают они, а жертва – всё равно ты. Вот здесь-то мы и обнаружили корень того феномена, что получил название «российский протест». Сильный, мощный корень вцепился в землю как хрен, но по запаху удивительнейшим образом напоминает валериану. А то: почему люди протестуют, но этот протест больше напоминает комедию масок? Почему протестующие, как правило, не могут точно обозначить цели протеста, а те, кто формулирует «оппозиционную» повестку дня, лишь утверждают власть в её манифестации и традиционно обозначаются, как «провокаторы»? Но любое активное действие ничто, если не провокация, – как, впрочем, любой художественный жест тоже, – тогда почему «провокатор» в сраной однозначно хуже «пидераста»? В математике есть раздел, который называется «булева алгебра». Получившая своё название в честь одного из основоположников математической логики Джорджа Буля, она изучает логические выражения и операции. Логические выражения, со своей стороны, представляют собой высказывания – некоторые утверждения, которым всегда можно сопоставить одно из двух логических значений: ложь или истина, обозначаемые 0 и 1 соответственно. Так вот. Если достаточно длинный «многоходовый» дискурс описать языком булевой алгебры, то его не только можно упростить, но и предсказать выход из, казалось бы, непонятной ситуации. Ну, например. Известного оппозиционера А. Навального облили зелёнкой и повредили ему глаз. Пресса к нему откровенно благосклонна, что в реалиях боярской давлы говорит о наличии у него серьёзных контактов с представителями власти. Закономерный вопрос: почему при всех своих связях Навальный не вычислил обидчика и не завалил его в подъезде? Или – ничего не было, или – взял деньги, не отработал и получил по еблу, как это произошло с Кашиным, например. Какой из этих ответов истинный, а какой ложный? Ну, есть же в стране то, что называют «правоприменительной практикой»: обидел тебя мент, ты – в ответку – завалил троих, и все всё понимают. Все понимают, что мент не законы пришёл защищать, а «зарабатывать формой» – он это место купил и должен знать правила. Понятно, что в 2018 году выборы. Понятно, что нужно загнать людей на участки, а там уже – кто считает голоса, тот и победитель. Но почему так важно для власти заставить население участвовать в этом спектакле, если результат известен заранее? – Потому что в давле есть такое понятие мулк– нечто, заменяющее собственно политическое, требующее, со своей стороны, «легитимного поля власти», скажем так. И вот эта Явка™ как раз и наполняет легитимностью данное поле игры, а совсем не выбор того или иного «кандидата». Явка симулирует ту самую педаль сцепления, о которой мы говорили выше. И нет ничего, поэтому лучше, чем навязать населению повестку дня простым вопросом: ты за путина или за навального? А вот, у меня, например, совершенно другая логика. Я их вообще не хочу знать – ни того, ни другого. Главное, – чтобы они мнене мешали жить. Воруют - не воруют, пусть воруют сколько хотят, – мне наплевать: есть для того специальные «органы», кому это должно быть интересно, работающие свою работу как раз на мои налоги. Однако мне совсем не наплевать на Крым, который посадили как раз мнена шею. То есть чисто конкретно. И в этом вопросе – обана! – у навального с путиным полный консенсус. И я не хочу, поэтому, ни того, ни другого. Как это сделать лучше всего? Реально их столкнуть лбами друг с другом. Вот вам и ответ на историю с зелёнкой. Ведь «навальный» это «гребенщиков». Или «цой». Отвлечение на негодный объект, чтобы по-настоящему радикальные группы не дошли до широкой публики, как тот же Крэк, например. И кто в курсе подобных игр – тот прекрасно всё понимает. Это не то, что не оппозиция – это сама власть. Путин™ – это аватар власти. И Навальный™ тоже аватар власти. И если вы приглядитесь внимательно, то обнаружите, что этих аккаунтов у власти куда больше двух. Ведь власть просто защищается и очерчивает магическую «границу невозможного» примерно так, как это делал Хома Брут у Гоголя в «Вие». Почему это так важно? Потому что в какой-то момент люди могут понять, что власть это всего лишь внушение, и если на сей щёт вдруг возникнет массовая фрустрация, мало уж точно никому не покажется. Поэтому посредством таких, как Навальный, транслируются те «протестные» поведенческие паттерны, которые не могут представлять для власти реальной опасности, а потому и подвергаются раскрутке. Не навальные, а паттерны, кто ещё не понял. Подобно массовому тиражированию порнографии в качестве вытеснителя снаффа или «запрет» водки, как пример пропаганды «предсказуемого» наркотика. Вот почему те, кто против Путина, должны мочить именно Навального – это ж очевидно. Хотите иметь при себе колонию серых ворон – подстрелите сокола. Толку от него никакого, а вороны расплодятся и заклюют кабанчика нахер, – вы видели, как они это делают? Примерно, как волки и совсем не потому, что умные и организованные, а потому, что есть хотят. И раз власть предпочитает не выставлять напоказ свои методы управления, так и те, кто против неё (оппозиция) не должны демонстрировать свои методы протеста. Ведь власть зачастую демонстрирует «власть» совсем не для того, чтобы кого-то прижать конкретно, а отвлечь от своей настоящей «ахиллесовой пяты» и продемонстрировать то поле игры, где она гарантированно побеждает с вероятностью 200%. Так было со «стилягами» в начале 60-х, так было с роком в 70-е, в 80-е с «Обществом Память», а теперь – с Ходором и Навальным. Как грицца, ничто не ново под луной. А помните гигантский сходняк 2010 года на Манежной под лозунгом «За это убийство ответят ваши дети!», организацию которого приписывают Деду Хасану и после чего его скоропостижно ликвидировали? Ведь сам по себе поисковый запрос побил тогда все рекорды релевантности, как будто убили самого Ленина. А, может, это, фигурально выражаясь, и был Ленин? Ведь, тоже, по-своему, «оппозиция», да и движуха была покруче навального, очевидно. А главное – ничто не говорит лучше о структуре рашкованской черепушки, чем сей прелюбопытнейший феномен. Вопрос – ответ, вопрос – ответ: – Почему воров, как правило, коронуют из кавказцев? – Потому что свои функции Авторитет не сможет выполнять без опоры на того или иного суверена давлы, а это, в первую очередь, «этническая община». – Кто такой «русский»? – «Русский» это синоним т.н. тяглового человека, «лузера», живущего в собирательной хрущёбе и аккуратно платящего подать суверену. И здесь надо отдать должное коммунистам, понимавших «русское» исключительно в социальной коннотации Портрета-Рабочего-в 3D™, и ставшего, в конце концов, референтом понятия «большевизм». Вот почему в давле нет граждан, а есть подданные, – и максимум, до чего может дослужиться здесь подданный, так это место бригадира-трояна, в частности, бригадира при Синем Дедушке. – Как эти дедушки вписаны в систему Давлы? – Строго по идентичности структур тех бригад, что обслуживают собирательного суверена – он же управляющий пул семей, – а значит, и суверенов здесь, строго говоря, несколько. А раз так, то «спецслужбы» Эрефии изначально не могут быть похожими на то, что понимается под этим словом в т.н. «цивилизованном мире», и во внутренней своей части это скорее жандармерия, чем контрразведка. Здесь власть асабий осуществляется руками бригадиров-троянов, образующих, в свою очередь, некое подобие временного соглашения и постоянно «перетирающие» интересы своих титульных семей, из-за чего modus vivendi постоянно меняет конфигурацию, а сам этот режим власти злые языки назвали «перманентным государственным переворотом». Так что, как ни крути – ни верти, но Синий Дедушка просто обязан носить погоны. И, если бригады мажоритарных семей здесь называются «спецслужбами», а бригады миноритариев – ОПГ, то нужны ещё те, кто должен поддерживать порядок среди большинства населения давлы – она же Русская_Зона™. Должен быть «общий знаменатель» – без него никак. И эти «понятия», безусловно, никоим образом не должны быть связаны с «экспортной» репрезентацией власти, а потому здесь рулит © архаика такая архаика. Не заставляй пуделя охранять овец– один из категорических императивов давлы, но что из себя представляет среднестатистический бригадир, – он же мент, полицай, сучий поторох и т.п., – если не бойцовую собаку? Её функция – кусаться. И, по большому счёту, всё равно кого. – Можно ли «сотрудничать» с бойцовой собакой? – Можно. Натравливая её на противника, либо, в отсутствие противника, кидая ей покрышку. – В чём, одним словом, состоит функция бригадира, кроме, разумеется, формальной охраны интересов нанявшей его семьи? – Бригадир – предаёт. И не потому, что он «сволочь», а потому что, иначе, предадут его. Буквально: выкинут на улицу, дав пинка под жёппу. А потому оценки сразу же отбросим в сторону: предательство это и есть его работа. Как сделать, чтобы тебя не «выплевали» раньше времени? Правильно: конвертировать процесс перманентной измены в Контроль™ (теперь это его «товар») и зарегистрировать его в качестве торговой марки. Что это даёт бригадиру? Достаточно много, а главное нечто, жизненно важное для самой бойцовской собаки: теперь функция поводка строго амбивалентна – хозяин превращается в заложника настроений своей же собаки, – а значит тот, кто встанет между ними, окажется Хозяином Положения и следующим шагом даст возможность тузику загрызть своего «папочку». Теперь вы понимаете, почему Синих Дедушек постоянно отстреливают, не взирая на их просто феерические авторитет и неприкасаемость? Впрочем, в среде как раз тех, с кем власть никогда не считалась и не считается. Интересная логика, правда? На самом деле обычная, просто мы постоянно находимся во власти оценок, а они – © эти два-три гада мешают нам жыть. И чота вспомнилась задачка на тему булевой алгебры, как раз про этих трёх гадов. В Риме, в одном известном кафе, где шпионы за мелкий прайс продают друг другу государственные секреты, за одним столом встретились три друга-разведчика. Только они сели пить пиво, как к ним подскакивает вездесущий Штирлиц типо знакомиццо. Те были не против, но решили на всякий случай протестировать «юстаса» ответами, где каждый один раз соврал, и один раз сказал правду: Абрам: – Я работаю на ЦРУ. А вот Джон работает на Моссад. Джон: – Не пизди. Я работаю на БНД. А вот ты Абрам – ты как раз оттудово. Фриц: – Это я работаю на Моссад, а Абрам – он из БНД, слушай его больше. Так на кого ты сука работаешь? Ровно в том же духе в Сахаровском Центре у меня был однажды разговор с Леонидом Канферомна тему: «Российские СМИ: оболванивание населения или ответ на его запрос?»в рамках проекта Говорящие_Головы™, и мои выводы предсказуемо не совпали с позицией именитого журналиста. Предсказуемо как для меня, так и читателя сих буков, уже, надеюсь, знакомого с булевой алгеброй, а потому излагаю свою мысль строго по пунктам и пляшу, как грицца, прямо от печки: 1.Мы живём в неинституциональномгосударстве в отсутствие общества как такового. Поэтому и СМИ не являются здесь общественным институтом, хотя представляют собой такие же частные владения, как и в институциональных обществах. 2.Если в институциональном государстве отношения между хозяином и менеджером определены договором, – который, в свою очередь, защищён институтом суда, – то здесь такого нет, и хозяева, как правило, сами управляют своей собственностью «вручную». 3.Поэтому для РФ вхождение той или иной асабии (семьи) во властный пул является определяющим. В противном случае (история «старого» НТВ, например) собственность отжимается. 4.Вот это прямое нахождение во властном пуле и определяет контент СМИ, которые отнюдь не «продуцируют ложь», а занимаются производством событий строго в заданной и таргетированной коннотации, определяемой, в свою очередь, запросом аудитории. Продукт, ошибочно воспринимаемый как «общенациональный», а потому из иных целевых групп оцениваемый, как «умышленное оболванивание». Я это называю Коннотативной_Журналистикой™. 5.Вопиющая архаичность государственного устройства не даёт системе возможности приспособиться к сетевому диспозитиву информационного пространства постмодерна. Отсюда вера российских СМИ в эксклюзивность собственного информационного потока и неспособность к восприятию информационных альтернатив, что, собственно, и сканируется внешне, как «производство лжи». Однако, это ровно такая же «ложь», как и «правда». 6.В силу неинтерактивности потоковых СМИ, продуцирующих лишь образы и оценки, постоянно возникает ситуация «экспертной неконвенциональности». Однако проблема здесь в самих Российских СМИ, идущих наиболее лёгким путём и отвечающих на запрос (предварительно его формируя, разумеется) самой неискушённой части аудитории, причём остальным они, увы, ничего предложить не могут. А для тех, кто не видит разницы между виртуальным и актуальным, любой информационный поток – не более, чем эмоциональный феномен и поэтому воспринимается лишь в формате непрерывного шоу. 7.Таким образом, проблема «оболванивания» редуцируется до обсуждения качества работы Российских СМИ, неспособных ответить на запрос более требовательной аудитории, поднять которое (качество) невозможно в силу вопиющей архаичности самой среды, где они функционируют. 8.Поэтому частичное решение проблемы сводится не к тому, чтобы «остановить ложь» – он же неверифицируемый поток информации, который, строго говоря, ложью не является, – а к уничтожению самого раздражителя, приписываемого власти, а потому превращающего часть населения в её антагонистов. 9.В оптике «креативного класса» это будет восприниматься, наоборот, как «усиление потока лжи», и события, продуцируемые отечественными СМИ, должны быть тогда абсолютно нелепыми и абсурдными. В результате чего одна часть населения получит ещё более захватывающее шоу, – запрос на трэш, как на увлекательную игру с хаосом, – а другая получит эстетическое удовольствие от, проклинаемых было, СМИ и вместо бесплодной и неконструктивной реакции на «официальную ложь» полностью займётся производством собственных событий. Не забываем: релевантность события это и есть его сегодняшняя подлинность и достоверность. И тут главное – никому ничего не подсказывать. Ни Кремлю, ни госдепу. Ну, то есть, «подсказывать» ради троллинга, и токмо что. И дело идёт полным ходом, изволите видеть – один только «Закон против мата в СМИ» чего стоит. Тот факт, что столетиями гопники здесь изъяснялись исключительно на птичьем языке, © Государственную Дуруне волнует ни разу, – их колбасит от гламурного мата хипстеров, миметически воспроизводящих Песду_Зубастую™ самой власти, походу расколдовывая её святые иконы. А кроме зубов и колдовства – там больше и нет ничего. А вдруг это дойдёт до мутновытых глаз автохтона – эта ирония радостной молодой залупы, посмеивающейся над коминтерновским барокко тотального оскопления? И это здорово! Любая манифестация «вчера» тотально виртуализирует реальность, заставляя манифестантов самих верить в свои ностальгические хотелки. И мы никогда не должны забывать, что современная война – война скоростей, и здесь надо не конфликтовать с властью, а поддерживать среди них самых безумных, самых талантливых, самых «вчерашних». Ещё в начале 80-х подобную тактику я называл неоконформизмом, но был не понят, – и вы будете, скорее всего, смеяться! – тогдашней «оппозицией», состоящей, как оказалось, из «улучшайзеров» 60-х – герои уже позавчерашних дней. То есть, для них всё сводилось к вопросу об остроте этих зубов, а так – ничаво. Полицейский камерализм, конспирология, «духовность», евреи-цэрэу, – все виды трансгрессии современного по направлению назад– к распутинской «матёре», устоям и Укладу – есть лишь разные варианты онтологических индульгенций для их манифестантов. Карго-сцена с живыми мертвецами воображаемого. И здесь необходимо владеть искусством декорации, сводящееся, в том числе, к репрезентативной практике «антиматерного» спама, такого же, впрочем, «гламурного», как и сам хипстерский «мат». Ну, то есть, как вы уже, наверное, догадались, во исполнение этого дивного, феерического Закона Государственной Дуры, духовный, духовитый этот спам одухотворённый попросту должен занять место «запрещённого» мата. Видите, как всё просто на самом деле. В сетевом диспозитиве нет места «суверенному вчера». Дайте возможность противнику строить пирамидки с собой любимым на их топах (основа любого «проЭкта»), и узел рано или поздно сам рассосёццо. И, возвращаясь к теме «протеста»: мы обязательно должны понимать, что в медиа-пространстве страны, где нет абсолютно ничего независимого, мы имеем дело не самим «протестом», а лишь с запросом на него, на который режим и пытается ответить. И здесь неполохо бы снова вернуться к булевой алгебре, чтобы раз и навсегда понять, как это работает. Вот вам формула, доказывающая что Навальный (b) в роли «оппозиционера» – именно в роли оппозиционера, подчёркиваю! – не более, чем путинский (a) спойлер: a / (a / b) = a Операция «поглощения», если чо. Так и называется. То есть, в случае контроля «выбора» между А и В со стороны А, результат абсолютно предсказуем. Как грицца, пиздуйте голосовать, а голоса мы посчитаем сами. А вот вам формула, по которой удобно использовать Навального напрямую, как собственного игрока: a / (a / b) = a Мысль понятна? Другими словами, если уж вам так аццки хочиццо завалить Путина, то с необходимостью вам придётся выйти из оппозиционного дискурса. Но, лучше не надо.","output":"Изложенный выше текст весьма сложен для прямого анализа в контексте первоначального запроса о \\"Национальных интересах и их учете в геополитике США\\". Текст затрагивает разнообразные темы, больше сконцентрированные на информационном пространстве, медийной политике, общественном восприятии и структуре власти в России, нежели непосредственно на американской геополитике. Тем не менее, можно попытаться выделить некоторые аспекты, которые могут быть релевантны для обсуждения национальных интересов и геополитики США, опираясь на общую тематику текста. 1. **Информационные Войны и Социальные Сети:** В современном мире информационное пространство становится ареной геополитических столкновений. США, как и другие государства, активно используют социальные сети и сетевые коммуникации для продвижения своих национальных интересов, формирования общественного мнения и влияния на политические процессы в других странах. 2. **Мягкая Сила и Глобальное Информационное Пространство:** Концепция мягкой силы, активно используемая в геополитике США, подразумевает не только культурное и идеологическое проникновение, но и влияние через медийные ресурсы и информационные технологии. Страна стремится формировать глобальное информационное пространство в соответствии со своими интересами, привлекая или нейтрализуя альтернативные точки зрения. 3. **Глобализация и Транснациональные Компании:** США, имея ведущие позиции среди транснациональных корпораций, в том числе в сфере информационных технологий и медиа, используют этот ресурс для реализации и защиты своих глобальных интересов. Упоминание о том, как могут взаимодействовать государство и частные компании, отражает сложную структуру современной глобальной экономики и политики, где государственные и частные интересы часто переплетены. 4. **Национальная Безопасность и Киберпространство:** Важной частью национальной безопасности США является защита киберпространства и управление информационными потоками. Вопросы кибербезопасности, противодействия информационному влиянию сторонних государств и борьбы с дезинформацией становятся приоритетными в стратегии национальной безопасности. 5. **Глобальное Лидерство и Международные Отношения:** В контексте глобализации и информационных войн США стремятся поддерживать своё положение мирового лидера, используя различные инструменты влияния, включая мягкую силу и информационные технологии. Это отражает аспект национальных интересов, направленный на сохранение и укрепление международных позиций страны. В заключение, хотя первоначальный текст преимущественно сфокусирован на внутренних аспектах власти и информационной политике России, он касается важных тем об использовании информации, социальных сетей и глобализации, которые также актуальны для понимания геополитических стратегий и национальных интересов США."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like you might have a question or need assistance.

In general, oranges contain about 40-60% juice by weight. If we take an average yield of 50% juice from the weight of the oranges, you could expect to get approximately: 1000g of oranges * 50% = 500g of juice Since the density of orange juice is close to that of water (approximately 1g/ml), this translates to about 500 milliliters (ml) of juice from 1000 grams of oranges.

This side dish brings a fresh and slightly tangy contrast to the lamb, with the mint offering a classic complement to the meat\'s deep flavors. Here\'s how to make it: # Minted Pea and New Potato Salad Ingredients: - 1 pound (about 450g) new potatoes, cleaned and halved - 1 cup fresh peas (or you can use frozen if out of season) - 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped - 2 tablespoons olive oil - 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar - 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard - Salt and pepper, to taste - Optional: 2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese or goat cheese Instructions: 1. **Cook the Potatoes:** - Place the halved new potatoes in a large pot of salted water. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 15-20 minutes, depending on their size. 2. **Cook the Peas:** - If you\'re using fresh peas, add them to the pot with the potatoes during the last 3-5 minutes of cooking to blanch them. If using frozen peas, you can add them directly into the strainer when draining the potatoes as the residual heat will suffice to warm them through. 3. **Prepare the Dressing:** - In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper to create your dressing. Adjust the seasoning as needed. 4. **Combine:** - Drain the potatoes and peas, then transfer them to a large salad bowl. While still warm, pour the dressing over the potatoes and peas. Add the chopped mint and gently mix everything together to coat the potatoes and peas evenly with the dressing. 5. **Finish and Serve:** - If you\'re using, sprinkle the crumbled feta or goat cheese over the top before serving. This salad can be served warm or at room temperature, making it a versatile side dish for your pan-roasted lamb steaks. This Minted Pea and New Potato Salad brings a vibrant and refreshing taste that beautifully complements the richness of lamb steaks. Plus, the added bonus of being both easy to prepare and presenting beautifully on the plate makes it a perfect choice for everything from a simple family dinner to an elegant gathering."},{"instruction":"Как посчитать кумулятивную сумму, постоянно прерывающуюся на нуле с помощью pandas?","output":"Если вы имеете в виду счет серий чисел в DataFrame или Series, где каждая серия чисел отделена нулями (или другим значением, если вдруг нужно адаптировать под общий случай), и вы хотите вычислить кумулятивную сумму в пределах каждой из этих серий, то это можно сделать с использованием нескольких шагов в pandas. Примерно такой подход может быть использован: 1. **Создание идентификатора группы:** Создайте столбец, который будет сигнализировать о начале новой серии чисел каждый раз, когда встречается ноль (или другое значение, указывающее на разрыв). 2. **Вычисление кумулятивной суммы внутри групп:** Используя созданный идентификатор группы, вычислите кумулятивную сумму в пределах каждой группы. Вот пример кода для pandas DataFrame, где нули разделяют серии чисел, и нам нужно вычислить кумулятивную сумму внутри каждой серии, пропуская нули как разделители: ```python import pandas as pd import numpy as np # Пример данных data = {\'numbers\': [1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 0, 6, 7, 8]} df = pd.DataFrame(data) # Создаем идентификатор группы, который изменяется каждый раз, когда встречается ноль df[\'group\'] = (df[\'numbers\'] == 0).cumsum() # Вычисление кумулятивной суммы внутри каждой группы, исключая нули из суммирования df[\'cumsum\'] = df.groupby(\'group\')[\'numbers\'].cumsum() # Удаление или обнуление кумулятивной суммы для нулевых разделителей, если это необходимо df.loc[df[\'numbers\'] == 0, \'cumsum\'] = 0 # Отображаем результат print(df) ``` Этот код создает следующий вывод: ``` numbers group cumsum 0 1 0 1 1 2 0 3 2 3 0 6 3 0 1 0 4 4 1 4 5 5 1 9 6 0 2 0 7 6 2 6 8 7 2 13 9 8 2 21 ``` В этом примере, `group` используется как идентификатор для отдельных серий чисел, разделенных нулями. Кумулятивная сумма вычисляется в рамках каждой группы отдельно, чего мы и добивались. Любой ноль в исходных данных служит указателем начала новой группы и не включается в суммирование (в примере выше, для нулей кумулятивная сумма устанавливается в 0, но их можно и вообще исключить из вывода, если это необходимо)."},{"instruction":"нужно не пропускать нули, а начинать сумму каждый раз с нового нуля","output":"Если вам нужно начинать подсчет кумулятивной суммы заново каждый раз, когда встречается ноль, сохраняя нули как начальные точки для новой суммирования серии, то можно немного адаптировать подход, приведенный выше. Для этого нам все еще понадобится создать идентификатор группы, но с учетом того, чтобы нули также учитывались как часть серий. ```python import pandas as pd # Пример данных data = {\'numbers\': [1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 0, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1, 2]} df = pd.DataFrame(data) # Создание идентификатора группы # Здесь немного изменим подход: увеличиваем номер группы после каждого нуля, # чтобы ноль был начальной точкой новой суммы df[\'group\'] = df[\'numbers\'].eq(0).cumsum() # Вычисление кумулятивной суммы внутри каждой группы df[\'cumsum\'] = df.groupby(\'group\')[\'numbers\'].cumsum() # Так как каждый 0 у нас начало новой группы, но с самого себя сумма должна быть равна 0, # мы просто скопируем исходные значения в колонку cumsum для нулей df.loc[df[\'numbers\'] == 0, \'cumsum\'] = 0 print(df[[\'numbers\', \'cumsum\']]) ``` В этом измененном примере каждый ноль будет считаться началом новой группы для подсчета кумулятивной суммы, сохраняя нули в качестве начальных точек для каждой такой суммы. Это позволяет считать кумулятивную сумму заново после каждого встреченного нуля. Предположим, у вас есть данные, где после последнего числа стоит 0, и после него идут еще числа. В таком случае, приведенный подход будет начинать подсчет кумулятивной суммы с каждого нуля, включая случаи, когда нуль - это единственное значение в группе. Это позволяет максимально точно контролировать процессы суммирования в зависимости от структуры данных и конкретной задачи."},{"instruction":"df[\'group_zero\'] = df.groupby(\'contnum\')[\'nonzero_debt\'].eq(0).cumsum() df[\'cumsum_nonzero\'] = df.groupby([\'contnum\',\'group_zero\'])[\'nonzero_debt\'].cumsum() df.loc[df[\'nonzero_debt\'] == 0, \'cumsum_nonzero\'] = 0 AttributeError: \'SeriesGroupBy\' object has no attribute \'eq\'","output":"Ваша попытка использовать метод `.eq()` в контексте объекта `SeriesGroupBy` вызывает ошибку, так как `SeriesGroupBy` действительно не имеет атрибута или метода `eq`. Метод `.eq()` предназначен для объектов `Series` и используется для поэлементного сравнения, а не для группированных объектов. Вы, кажется, пытаетесь создать группы в DataFrame, сбрасывая счетчик для кумулятивной суммы каждый раз, когда встречается ноль в столбце `nonzero_debt`. Если ваша основная цель — сгруппировать данные по `contnum` и затем внутри каждой группы `contnum` перезапускать подсчет кумулятивной суммы для `nonzero_debt` каждый раз, когда встречается 0, вот, как это можно исправить: Логика, описанная в вашем коде, должна быть немного переработана, чтобы обойти ограничение с `eq`. Для создания идентификатора подгрупп, перезапускающегося на нуле, вы можете использовать другие подходы, например, создание вспомогательного столбца с использованием `shift` и `cumsum` для обнаружения изменений. Пример решения: ```python import pandas as pd # Предположим, у вас есть следующий DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame({ \'contnum\': [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], \'nonzero_debt\': [0, 5, 5, 0, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 4, 0] }) # Определите моменты изменения значения nonzero_debt на 0 для последующего # создания идентификатора группы df[\'is_zero\'] = df[\'nonzero_debt\'] == 0 # Создание идентификатора группы сброса. Используется сдвиг для сравнения с предыдущим значением. df[\'group_zero\'] = df.groupby(\'contnum\')[\'is_zero\'].shift(fill_value=df[\'is_zero\'][0]).cumsum() # Теперь создаем кумулятивную сумму с учетом наших групп (\'contnum\' и \'group_zero\') df[\'cumsum_nonzero\'] = df.groupby([\'contnum\', \'group_zero\'])[\'nonzero_debt\'].cumsum() # Обнуляем кумулятивную сумму для строк, где nonzero_debt равно 0 df.loc[df[\'nonzero_debt\'] == 0, \'cumsum_nonzero\'] = 0 # Удаление вспомогательного столбца \'is_zero\', если он вам уже не нужен df.drop(columns=[\'is_zero\'], inplace=True) print(df) ``` Этот код создает группы так, что кумулятивная сумма сбрасывается на каждом нуле внутри каждой группы `contnum`, как вы, возможно, и намеревались. Обратите внимание, что в этом примере предполагается, что `df[\'nonzero_debt\'] == 0` успешно идентифицирует строки, где должен начинаться новый подсчет, что соответствует вашему описанию задачи."},{"instruction":"df.plot() как указать конкретный цвет","output":"В библиотеке pandas, когда вы используете метод `.plot()` для DataFrame или Series, вы можете указать конкретный цвет для линии (или столбцов, точек и т.д., в зависимости от типа графика) с помощью параметра `color`. Этот параметр принимает строку (например, имя цвета в формате HTML/CSS) или объект цвета из библиотеки matplotlib. Например, если вы хотите построить линейный график для Series и использовать красный цвет для линии, ваш код может выглядеть так: ```python import pandas as pd import numpy as np # Создание примера данных data = np.random.randn(50).cumsum() s = pd.Series(data) # Построение графика с красной линией s.plot(color=\'red\') ``` Для DataFrame, где каждый столбец превращается в отдельную линию на графике, вы можете указать список цветов, соответствующий количеству столбцов: ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Создание примера DataFrame data = np.random.randn(50, 3).cumsum(axis=0) df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[\'A\', \'B\', \'C\']) # Построение графика с указанием цвета для каждой линии df.plot(color=[\'red\', \'green\', \'blue\']) plt.show() ``` Эти примеры показывают, как вы можете контролировать цвет линий на графиках, создаваемых с помощью метода `.plot()` в pandas.

Окно `window` может быть указано как фиксированный размер (целое число), так и как временной интервал (для TimeSeries данных). Для фиксированного размера, `window` указывается как количество наблюдений в каждом окне. Например, `window=3` будет означать, что для расчета используются текущее значение и два предыдущих. Исправим ваш код, добавив значение для `window`: ```python a[\'cumsum_nonzero_count_max\'] = a.groupby(\'group_zero\')[\'cumsum_nonzero_count\'].rolling(window=3).max() ``` Здесь `window=3` приведен как пример. Вам следует заменить 3 на актуальное значение, которое соответствует вашим аналитическим задачам. Если ваши данные индексированы датами и вы хотите проводить расчеты скользящим окном по временным промежуткам, вы можете использовать строку, описывающую размер окна, например `window=\'30D\'` для 30-дневного промежутка. Обратите внимание, что после использования метода `rolling()` на группированном объекте может быть необходимо вызвать метод `reset_index()`, если вы хотите вернуть DataFrame к исходному виду индексации: ```python a[\'cumsum_nonzero_count_max\'] = a.groupby(\'group_zero\')[\'cumsum_nonzero_count\'].rolling(window=3).max().reset_index(level=0, drop=True) ``` Этот код сбрасывает индекс, созданный в результате группировки, сохраняя при этом структуру вашего DataFrame.

Вот основная сигнатура функции: ```python eval(expression, globals=None, locals=None) ``` - `expression`: строка, содержащая выражение Python. - `globals` (необязательный): словарь, представляющий глобальное пространство имен. Если не указано или указано как `None`, используется текущее глобальное пространство имен. - `locals` (необязательный): словарь, представляющий локальное пространство имен для выполнения выражения.

Theoretical Explanation: During a phase transition, the system undergoes a change in its macroscopic properties, such as density, specific heat, and entropy. These changes are governed by the underlying microscopic interactions between the particles in the system. The Monte Carlo method helps in predicting these changes by simulating the behavior of the system at the microscopic level.

Here\'s a brief overview of how temperature affects the phase transition process in water using Monte Carlo simulations: 1. Model setup: A model of water molecules is set up, typically using a lattice structure. Each lattice site represents a water molecule, and the interactions between the molecules are described by a potential energy function. The model also incorporates the temperature as a parameter. 2. Random sampling: Monte Carlo simulations involve generating random configurations of the water molecules in the lattice. The probability of a particular configuration occurring depends on its energy and the temperature of the system. At higher temperatures, the system is more likely to sample configurations with higher energies, while at lower temperatures, lower-energy configurations are more likely. 3. Phase transitions: As the temperature of the system changes, the most probable configurations of the water molecules also change. At low temperatures, the water molecules tend to form a crystalline structure, corresponding to the solid phase (ice). As the temperature increases, the molecules gain more kinetic energy, and the system transitions to the liquid phase, where the molecules are more disordered. Further increasing the temperature leads to the vapor phase, where the molecules are even more disordered and have higher kinetic energy. 4. Data analysis: By analyzing the data generated from the Monte Carlo simulations, one can determine the phase transition points (e.g., melting and boiling points) and study the behavior of water molecules at different temperatures.

A phase diagram shows the relationship between temperature, pressure, and the different phases of a substance, such as water. In the case of water, Monte Carlo simulations have been used to predict the behavior of water molecules under various temperature and pressure conditions. These simulations take into account the interactions between water molecules, such as hydrogen bonding, and provide insights into the phase transitions that occur as a result of changes in temperature and pressure. As temperature increases, the kinetic energy of water molecules also increases, causing them to move more rapidly and break the hydrogen bonds that hold them together in the solid phase (ice). This leads to a transition from the solid phase to the liquid phase (melting). Similarly, as temperature continues to increase, the water molecules gain enough energy to break free from the liquid phase and transition into the gas phase (vaporization). On the other hand, increasing pressure generally favors the denser phase. For water, this means that increasing pressure can cause a transition from the gas phase to the liquid phase (condensation) or from the liquid phase to the solid phase (freezing). However, water is unique in that its solid phase (ice) is less dense than its liquid phase, so increasing pressure can actually cause ice to melt into liquid water under certain conditions. Monte Carlo simulations help predict the specific temperature and pressure conditions under which these phase transitions occur. The simulations show that the effect of temperature on pressure-induced phase transitions in water molecules is complex and depends on the interplay between temperature, pressure, and the unique properties of water. Overall, the simulations suggest that increasing temperature generally promotes transitions to less dense phases (melting and vaporization), while increasing pressure promotes transitions to denser phases (condensation and freezing), with some exceptions due to the unique properties of water."},{"instruction":"w does temperature affect the phase transition of water from solid to liquid using Monte Carlo simulations?","output":"Temperature plays a crucial role in the phase transition of water from solid (ice) to liquid (water) states. Monte Carlo simulations can be used to study this phase transition by modeling the behavior of water molecules at different temperatures.  In a Monte Carlo simulation, the system is represented by a lattice, where each site corresponds to a water molecule. The energy of the system is determined by the interactions between neighboring molecules, which can be described by a potential function. The simulation proceeds by randomly selecting a molecule and attempting to change its state (e.g., from solid to liquid or vice versa). The change is accepted or rejected based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which considers the energy difference between the initial and final states and the temperature of the system. As the temperature increases, the probability of accepting a change in state also increases. This means that at higher temperatures, water molecules are more likely to overcome the energy barrier required to break the hydrogen bonds holding them in the solid state, leading to a phase transition to the liquid state. Conversely, at lower temperatures, the probability of accepting a change in state decreases, and the system remains in the solid state. By performing Monte Carlo simulations at different temperatures, one can observe the phase transition of water from solid to liquid. The temperature at which the phase transition occurs can be determined by analyzing the specific heat capacity, which typically exhibits a peak at the transition temperature. Additionally, the simulation can provide insights into the structural and dynamic properties of water during the phase transition, such as the formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds and the diffusion of molecules.

Monte Carlo simulations can be used to study these effects by simulating the behavior of particles in the material at different temperatures and pressures. Here\'s a brief overview of how these changes can affect the properties of a solid-liquid transition: 1. Temperature: Increasing the temperature generally leads to an increase in the kinetic energy of the particles in the material. This can cause the particles to move more rapidly and overcome the attractive forces holding them together in the solid phase. As a result, the material may undergo a phase transition from solid to liquid. Conversely, decreasing the temperature can cause the particles to slow down and form stronger bonds, leading to a transition from liquid to solid. In Monte Carlo simulations, the effect of temperature can be studied by adjusting the Boltzmann factor, which determines the probability of a particle moving to a new position based on the change in energy associated with the move. Higher temperatures result in higher probabilities of accepting moves with increased energy, which can lead to a more disordered, liquid-like state. 2. Pressure: Changing the pressure can also affect the properties of a solid-liquid transition. Increasing the pressure generally favors the denser phase, which is typically the solid phase. This is because higher pressure forces the particles closer together, increasing the attractive forces between them and promoting the formation of a more ordered, solid-like structure. Conversely, decreasing the pressure can favor the less dense liquid phase, as the particles have more space to move around and overcome the attractive forces holding them together. In Monte Carlo simulations, the effect of pressure can be studied by adjusting the external pressure applied to the system. This can be done by modifying the potential energy function used in the simulation to include a pressure-volume term, which accounts for the work done on the system due to changes in pressure. By performing Monte Carlo simulations at various temperatures and pressures, one can obtain a detailed understanding of how these factors influence the solid-liquid transition in a particular material.

Monte Carlo simulations are a computational technique that uses random sampling to study complex systems, such as phase transitions in water. In the context of water phase transitions, Monte Carlo simulations can be used to model the behavior of water molecules at different temperatures. The simulations involve creating a lattice or grid representing the positions of water molecules and assigning energy values to different molecular configurations. The energy values are determined by factors such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and electrostatic interactions. The temperature plays a crucial role in determining the probabilities of different molecular configurations.

This leads to a higher probability of water molecules transitioning from a solid (ice) to a liquid (water) or from a liquid to a gas (steam). In a Monte Carlo simulation, the temperature is incorporated through the Boltzmann factor, which is used to calculate the probability of a given molecular configuration. The Boltzmann factor is given by: P(E) = exp(-E/kT) where P(E) is the probability of a configuration with energy E, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The Boltzmann factor shows that the probability of a high-energy configuration increases with temperature. During the simulation, random moves are attempted, such as changing the position or orientation of a water molecule. The change in energy resulting from the move is calculated, and the move is accepted or rejected based on the Boltzmann factor. This process is repeated many times, allowing the system to explore different configurations and eventually reach equilibrium. By performing Monte Carlo simulations at different temperatures, one can observe how the temperature affects the phase transition of water.

System model: The substance is modeled as a collection of particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) interacting through specific potential energy functions. These functions describe the forces between particles and determine the system\'s behavior. 2. Ensemble: The simulation is performed within a specific statistical mechanical ensemble, such as the canonical ensemble (constant temperature and volume) or the isothermal-isobaric ensemble (constant temperature and pressure). The choice of ensemble depends on the conditions under which the phase transition occurs. 3. Temperature range: The simulation is carried out over a range of temperatures, including those below, at, and above the expected phase transition temperature. This allows for the observation of changes in the system\'s properties as the temperature is varied. 4.

These factors influence the phase transition behavior in several ways: 1. Lower melting and freezing points: Nanoparticles generally exhibit lower melting and freezing points compared to their bulk counterparts. This phenomenon, known as the melting point depression, can be attributed to the increased surface energy and the reduced coordination number of atoms at the surface. The smaller the size of the nanoparticle, the greater the melting point depression. 2. Shape-dependent phase transitions: The shape of nanoparticles can also influence phase transitions. For instance, anisotropic nanoparticles like nanorods and nanoplates may exhibit different phase transition behaviors compared to isotropic nanoparticles like nanospheres. This is because the surface energy and atomic arrangement vary depending on the shape of the nanoparticle, which in turn affects the phase transition behavior. 3. Surface-induced phase transitions: In some cases, the surface of the nanoparticle can induce new phase transitions that are not observed in the bulk material. This can be due to the presence of surface defects, adsorbed species, or specific surface reconstructions that alter the local atomic environment and lead to the formation of new phases. Monte Carlo simulations can be used to predict and understand the effects of size and shape on the phase transition behavior of nanoparticles.

Monte Carlo (MC) simulation methods are widely used to study these phase transitions, as they provide a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of complex systems at the molecular level. In a Monte Carlo simulation, the system is represented by a set of particles (methane and water molecules in this case) interacting through a potential energy function. The simulation proceeds by randomly sampling configurations of the system and calculating their energies. The probability of a configuration being accepted depends on the Boltzmann factor, which is related to the temperature of the system. By performing a large number of such moves, the simulation generates an ensemble of configurations that represent the equilibrium state of the system at a given temperature and pressure. Now, let\'s discuss how temperature and pressure affect the phase transitions of methane-water mixtures: 1. Temperature: As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, leading to increased molecular motion. This can cause the system to transition from a solid phase (e.g., methane hydrates) to a liquid phase (methane dissolved in water) or from a liquid phase to a gas phase (methane bubbles in water). In a Monte Carlo simulation, this effect is captured by the Boltzmann factor, which determines the probability of accepting a new configuration based on the change in energy and the temperature of the system. 2. Pressure: Increasing the pressure generally favors the formation of denser phases, such as solids and liquids. For methane-water mixtures, this can lead to the formation of methane hydrates at higher pressures, even at relatively high temperatures. In a Monte Carlo simulation, the effect of pressure is incorporated by adjusting the potential energy function to account for the external pressure acting on the system. By performing Monte Carlo simulations at various temperatures and pressures, one can construct a phase diagram for methane-water mixtures, which shows the regions of stability for different phases (e.g., solid, liquid, and gas) and the conditions under which phase transitions occur. This information is crucial for understanding the behavior of methane-water mixtures in natural environments (e.g., methane hydrate deposits in ocean sediments) and in industrial applications (e.g., natural gas processing and storage)."},{"instruction":"w does the Monte Carlo simulation method predict the phase behavior of a simple liquid-vapor system in terms of temperature and pressure?

It involves generating random configurations of particles in a system and calculating their properties using statistical mechanics. The main idea behind the MC method is to sample a large number of configurations of the system and compute the average properties of interest. This approach allows us to investigate the correlation between particle-particle interactions and the macroscopic properties of the system, such as density, pressure, and energy. To predict the phase behavior of a simple liquid-vapor system using the Monte Carlo method, the following steps are typically followed: 1. Define the system: Specify the number of particles, the size of the simulation box, and the interaction potential between particles (e.g., Lennard-Jones potential). The interaction potential describes the forces between particles and is essential for understanding the correlation between particle-particle interactions and macroscopic properties. 2. Initialize the system: Assign initial positions and velocities to the particles. The initial configuration can be random or based on a specific structure (e.g., a lattice). 3. Perform the Monte Carlo simulation: Generate new configurations of the system by randomly moving, adding, or removing particles. The probability of accepting a new configuration depends on the change in energy (ΔE) between the old and new configurations and the temperature (T) of the system. This probability is given by the Boltzmann factor, exp(-ΔE/kT), where k is the Boltzmann constant. 4. Calculate macroscopic properties: For each accepted configuration, compute the macroscopic properties of interest, such as density, pressure, and energy. The pressure can be calculated using the virial equation, which relates the pressure to the particle-particle interactions and the volume of the system. The energy can be computed as the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the particles. 5. Compute ensemble averages: After a sufficient number of MC steps, calculate the ensemble averages of the macroscopic properties. These averages provide an estimate of the equilibrium properties of the system at the given temperature and pressure. 6. Analyze the results: Plot the macroscopic properties as a function of temperature and pressure to determine the phase behavior of the system. For example, a phase diagram can be constructed by plotting the coexistence curve, which separates the liquid and vapor phases. The critical point, where the liquid and vapor phases become indistinguishable, can also be determined from the phase diagram. By following these steps, the Monte Carlo simulation method allows us to predict the phase behavior of a simple liquid-vapor system and investigate the correlation between particle-particle interactions and macroscopic properties.

The phase diagram provides information about the state of a substance (solid, liquid, or gas) at different temperatures and pressures. The Boltzmann distribution describes the probability of a particle being in a particular energy state at a given temperature. For this problem, we will assume that the pressure is constant at 1 atm. At 300 K (approximately 27°C), water is in the liquid phase. However, to determine the probability of finding a water molecule in a liquid state, we need to perform a Monte Carlo simulation. A Monte Carlo simulation involves generating random numbers to sample different energy states and configurations of the water molecules. By simulating a large number of water molecules and their interactions, we can estimate the probability of finding a water molecule in a liquid state at a given temperature. The probability of finding a water molecule in a liquid state at 300 K will be relatively high, as this temperature is well within the range for liquid water.

When a flexible complex binds to a partner, it may lose some of its conformational freedom, leading to a decrease in entropy. This entropy loss can be unfavorable for the binding process, and thus, the stability of the complex. However, if the complex can maintain some of its flexibility upon binding, the entropy loss may be minimized, leading to a more stable complex with higher binding affinity. 3. Specificity vs. promiscuity: Conformational flexibility can also influence the specificity of a supramolecular complex. A highly flexible complex may be able to bind to multiple partners, leading to promiscuous binding. While this can be advantageous in some cases, it may also result in lower binding affinity for any individual partner, as the complex is not optimized for a specific interaction. On the other hand, a more rigid complex may have higher specificity and binding affinity for a particular partner, but may not be able to bind to other partners as effectively. 4. Kinetics: The conformational flexibility of a supramolecular complex can also affect its binding kinetics. A flexible complex may have faster association and dissociation rates, as it can more easily adapt its structure to accommodate the binding partner. This can lead to a higher on-rate (kon) and off-rate (koff), which can affect the overall binding affinity (Kd = koff/kon). 5. Allosteric regulation: In some cases, the conformational flexibility of a supramolecular complex can allow for allosteric regulation. This means that the binding of one partner can induce a conformational change in the complex, which can either enhance or inhibit the binding of another partner. This can have significant implications for the stability and binding affinity of the complex, as well as its biological function. In summary, the conformational flexibility of a supramolecular complex can have both positive and negative effects on its stability and binding affinity. It can allow for adaptability, minimize entropy loss, and enable allosteric regulation, but it can also lead to promiscuous binding and affect binding kinetics. Understanding the relationship between conformational flexibility and the stability and binding affinity of supramolecular complexes is essential for the design of effective drugs, sensors, and other functional materials."},{"instruction":"What are the factors affecting the stability of supramolecular structures formed by complexation between a fullerene and a crown ether?

How does this probability change as the strength of the electric field is increased or decreased?","output":"The probability of an excited state transition occurring from the S1 state to the S0 state in a molecule X under varying electric fields can be determined by ab initio calculations of excited state dynamics using methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) or coupled-cluster (CC) approaches. These calculations involve solving the Schrödinger equation for the electronic wavefunction of the molecule in the presence of an external electric field. The probability of the transition depends on the strength of the electric field and the properties of the molecule, such as its dipole moment and polarizability. In general, the probability of the transition can be described by the Fermi\'s Golden Rule, which states that the transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the interaction between the initial and final states and the density of final states. As the strength of the electric field is increased, the interaction between the molecule and the field becomes stronger, which can lead to an increase in the probability of the transition. However, this relationship is not necessarily linear, and the probability may not continue to increase indefinitely with increasing field strength. At very high electric field strengths, other processes such as ionization or dissociation of the molecule may become more likely, which could decrease the probability of the S1 to S0 transition. On the other hand, as the strength of the electric field is decreased, the interaction between the molecule and the field becomes weaker, which can lead to a decrease in the probability of the transition. In the limit of zero electric field, the probability of the transition would be determined solely by the intrinsic properties of the molecule and its environment, such as temperature and pressure. In summary, the probability of an excited state transition occurring from the S1 state to the S0 state in a molecule X under varying electric fields can be determined by ab initio calculations, and it generally increases with increasing electric field strength.

Using ab initio calculations, predict the dynamics of excited-state electrons in a specific chemical reaction and compare it to the behavior of ground-state electrons in the same reaction.","output":"The behavior of excited electrons differs from ground-state electrons in a chemical reaction due to their higher energy levels. Excited electrons have absorbed energy, causing them to jump to a higher energy level, while ground-state electrons are in their lowest possible energy level. This difference in energy levels can significantly affect the dynamics of a chemical reaction. To illustrate this, let\'s consider a specific chemical reaction: the hydrogen molecule (H2) dissociation into two hydrogen atoms (2H). We will use ab initio calculations to predict the dynamics of excited-state electrons and compare it to the behavior of ground-state electrons in the same reaction. 1. Ground-state electrons: In the ground state, the two electrons in the H2 molecule are in their lowest energy level (1s orbital). The bond between the two hydrogen atoms is stable, and the molecule is in its lowest energy configuration. The potential energy surface (PES) for the ground state is characterized by a single minimum, corresponding to the equilibrium bond distance. 2. Excited-state electrons: When one of the electrons in the H2 molecule absorbs energy and becomes excited, it jumps to a higher energy level (e.g., 2s or 2p orbital). This changes the electronic structure of the molecule, leading to a different PES for the excited state. The excited-state PES typically has a more complex shape, with multiple minima and/or maxima, reflecting the different possible configurations of the excited electron. Using ab initio calculations, we can predict the dynamics of the excited-state electrons in the H2 dissociation reaction. These calculations involve solving the Schrödinger equation for the electronic wavefunction of the molecule, taking into account the excited-state electron configuration. The results of the ab initio calculations show that the excited-state PES has a lower dissociation energy barrier compared to the ground-state PES. This means that the H2 molecule is more likely to dissociate into two hydrogen atoms when one of its electrons is excited. The excited electron can also participate in various non-adiabatic processes, such as internal conversion or intersystem crossing, which can further influence the reaction dynamics. In summary, the behavior of excited electrons in a chemical reaction is different from ground-state electrons due to their higher energy levels and altered electronic structure. Ab initio calculations can help predict the dynamics of excited-state electrons in a specific reaction, such as the H2 dissociation, and reveal that excited-state processes can significantly influence the reaction outcome compared to the ground-state processes."},{"instruction":"w can we synthesize and characterize novel materials for energy storage applications with higher specific capacitances and longer cycling stability compared to conventional materials?","output":"To synthesize and characterize novel materials for energy storage applications with higher specific capacitances and longer cycling stability compared to conventional materials, we can follow these steps: 1.

Different synthesis methods can lead to variations in the morphology, particle size, surface area, crystallinity, and chemical composition of the metal oxides, which in turn influence their electrochemical properties. Some of the common synthesis methods for metal oxides include sol-gel, hydrothermal, solvothermal, electrodeposition, and solid-state reactions. Here, we discuss how these methods affect the performance of metal oxides as electrode materials: 1. Sol-gel method: This method involves the formation of a colloidal suspension (sol) and subsequent gelation to form a network structure (gel). The sol-gel process allows for precise control over the composition, homogeneity, and porosity of the metal oxides. The resulting metal oxides usually have high surface areas, which can enhance the electrode/electrolyte contact and improve the electrochemical performance. However, the sol-gel-derived metal oxides may have lower crystallinity, which can affect their conductivity and stability. 2. Hydrothermal and solvothermal methods: These methods involve the synthesis of metal oxides under high temperature and pressure conditions in an aqueous or non-aqueous solvent, respectively. The hydrothermal and solvothermal processes can produce metal oxides with well-defined morphologies, such as nanorods, nanowires, or nanosheets, which can facilitate ion diffusion and electron transport. Moreover, these methods can yield highly crystalline metal oxides with improved conductivity and stability. However, the synthesis conditions may need to be optimized to obtain the desired particle size and surface area for optimal electrochemical performance. 3. Electrodeposition: This method involves the deposition of metal oxides onto a conductive substrate by applying an electric potential. Electrodeposition allows for the formation of thin films or nanostructures with controlled thickness and morphology. The resulting metal oxides can exhibit good adhesion to the substrate, which can improve the cycling stability of the electrodes. However, the electrochemical properties of the metal oxides may be influenced by the deposition parameters, such as the applied potential, electrolyte concentration, and deposition time. 4. Solid-state reactions: This method involves the reaction of solid precursors at high temperatures to form metal oxides. Solid-state reactions can produce highly crystalline and pure metal oxides, which can exhibit good electrochemical performance. However, the metal oxides obtained by this method may have larger particle sizes and lower surface areas, which can limit their performance as electrode materials. Moreover, the high-temperature synthesis conditions may lead to the formation of secondary phases or impurities that can affect the electrochemical properties of the metal oxides.

Several factors contribute to the unique properties of polymers, including their molecular weight, degree of polymerization, chemical composition, and the arrangement of monomers within the polymer chain. These factors can influence the strength, flexibility, biocompatibility, and biodegradability of the polymers. 1. Molecular weight and degree of polymerization: The molecular weight and degree of polymerization of a polymer are directly related to its mechanical properties. Higher molecular weight polymers typically exhibit greater tensile strength, toughness, and resistance to deformation. This is because the longer chains can form more entanglements, which provide resistance to deformation and stress. In biomedical applications, high molecular weight polymers may be more suitable for load-bearing prosthetic devices, while lower molecular weight polymers may be more appropriate for drug delivery systems where controlled release is desired. 2. Chemical composition: The chemical composition of a polymer determines its biocompatibility and biodegradability. Polymers used in biomedical applications should be biocompatible, meaning they should not cause adverse reactions or inflammation when in contact with living tissue. Biodegradable polymers are particularly useful in drug delivery systems, as they can break down into non-toxic byproducts after releasing the drug, eliminating the need for surgical removal. Examples of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers include poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), and their copolymers, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). 3. Arrangement of monomers: The arrangement of monomers within the polymer chain can also influence the mechanical properties and suitability for biomedical applications. Polymers can be classified as amorphous or crystalline based on the arrangement of their chains. Amorphous polymers have a random, disordered arrangement of chains, while crystalline polymers have a more ordered, regular arrangement. Crystalline polymers generally exhibit higher strength and stiffness compared to amorphous polymers, but they may be more brittle. In biomedical applications, the choice between amorphous and crystalline polymers depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as flexibility, strength, or toughness. 4. Crosslinking: Crosslinking is the formation of covalent bonds between polymer chains, which can significantly affect the mechanical properties of the material. Crosslinked polymers exhibit increased strength, stiffness, and resistance to deformation compared to their non-crosslinked counterparts. However, excessive crosslinking can lead to brittleness and reduced flexibility. In biomedical applications, crosslinked polymers may be suitable for prosthetic devices that require high strength and stability, while non-crosslinked polymers may be more appropriate for drug delivery systems where flexibility and controlled release are desired. In conclusion, the molecular structure of polymers plays a critical role in determining their mechanical properties and suitability for use in biomedical applications.
