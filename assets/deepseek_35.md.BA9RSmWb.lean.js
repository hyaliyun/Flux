That may be because the worst appears to be over - or the best, if you're an oil consumer, and most of us are. The price per barrel of global benchmark Brent Crude ended April just above 47. Since dipping briefly below 30 in January, it has risen by nearly two-thirds. That sounds a lot. And it is. But it's worth remembering that the price is down by 30% on this time last year, and by 60% on its most recent peak, in June 2014. So what's going on, and what does it tell us about the future direction of travel? Last month saw members of OPEC, the cartel of major oil exporters, fail to agree on a way of limiting production so as to push prices up. It looks to some, such as Oxford Economics, as if the cartel is dead. Or like the Norwegian blue parrot, it's resting. That is partly because two big players, Saudi Arabia and Iran, have a growing regional rivalry. It is also because non-OPEC members have much more influence on prices than used to be the case. The price could have plummeted with that April failure to agree a freeze on production levels. But it didn't. It barely stumbled, and then continued its rising trend. Now, oil industry analysts are pointing to a continuing upside to the price. The boss of the International Energy Agency was the most recent to do so, commenting over the weekend. OPEC is next due to meet again in Vienna on June 2. But having ridden out the last failure to agree, and with prices rising despite that, there is less pressure to do a deal. The Saudis left little doubt that their decision in late 2014 to retain production levels in order to sustain market share was intended to drive their new US rivals out of production. Shale oil had followed on the shale gas boom in the USA. It helps explain why the country's crude oil production rose 57% between 2012 and 2015. But the nature of a shale well is that it depletes in up to a couple of years, and then the reservoir has to be re-fracked. There are only around half the shale rigs drilling in the US than there were a year ago. The low price has meant that it's not been worth going after more. Indeed, US shale drillers are in a lot of financial distress. Supply remains one million to two million barrels per day more than demand. The fall of US output should help ease back on that over-supply. It represents more than half of the 700,000 barrels per day decline in non-OPEC output expected this year. But America's frackers are ready to come back, if the price does. They will probably start doing so at around 55. The International Energy Agency estimates that Texas and the Dakotas kick back in at 60 to 65, and could then take a year or so to return to steady production. Before then, a rising price will lead to the release into the market of large stocks of oil that have been built up in the past 18 months. Commercial reserves in the OECD more developed nations, according to the International Energy Agency, stand at more than three billion barrels. That 60 to 70 range is seen as the most likely one for the price to stabilise, at least for a while. Back in the heart of OPEC, around the Persian Gulf, Iran is determined to ignore the cartel's pressure to keep total supply suppressed. Having been allowed to export since January, the Tehran government wants to get back to what it was producing before sanctions were imposed in 2011, and a bit more. It was then at 3.5m barrels per day, and according to industry analysis from Platt's consultancy, it's nearly back to that level. It has stated that it wants to average 4m barrels per day this year. Much of that is currently going to refineries in India and South Korea. It has recently become easier to insure tankers sailing out of Iran, meaning it will play a more significant role in supplying Europe in coming months. That's out of more than 95 million barrels produced globally each day, more than 10m of them from Saudi Arabia. which is part of more than 32m from OPEC countries. That OPEC figure is reckoned by Reuters surveying to have crept up again in April, helping to explain a fall in price at the start of the first, low-volume trading day of May. (If it helps get a sense of scale, the UK's output of oil and its gas equivalent has risen recently to 1.5m barrels per day.) Iraq is also ramping up post-war production, reaching 4.16m barrels per day in March. But some other countries are seeing it fall. Nigeria has disruptions from vandalism and attacks on its infrastructure. Venezuela's economy is in dire straits and Libya faces a civil war, so both have seen output cut by a shortage of power necessary to operate production plants. Oil extraction requires a lot of energy. Then there's the demand side of the imbalance. Last year saw demand growth strengthen a bit, having dipped with the stalling of emerging market growth. A more recent analysis from the IEA suggests that it is continuing to rise to 1.2m barrels per day more this year. That's a slower rate of rise than the back end of 2015, as China, Europe and the US demand eases. But while it's rising, it helps close the gap between demand and supply and get the market more balanced again. And there's another factor - the mighty greenback. The US dollar has weakened by around 6% against a basket of currencies since the start of the year, and that helps drive up the cost of a dollar-denominated commodity. What about the longer term? In a brave bit of forecasting, Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie energy consultancy last week put out a warning of a huge, 4.5m barrels per day supply shortage. That, it suggested, could be with us in 2035. The reasoning for this is that the industry has become much less effective, or lucky, at finding new oil reserves. Even before the price slump cut exploration budgets by 40 to 50%, the annual discoveries of liquid reserves of hydrocarbons fell by roughly half between 2008 and 2015. The average year has seen around eight billion barrels of oil found. Last year, it was less than three billion. A much harder calculation is how much demand there will be if the world's oil users are to meet their commitments to climate change targets. If governments are true to their word, with written agreement of the Paris accord signed in the past few days, and if technology helps renewable power replace fossil fuels, the oil market 19 years from now may look very different What is a summary of this text?","output":"In the oil industry, many factors are influencing the global market and future direction. The failure of OPEC to limit production and the rivalry between major players, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, have led to less pressure to reach a deal. US shale production has played a significant role, with the nature of shale wells requiring re-fracking to maintain production levels. Supply remains higher than demand, and the decline in non-OPEC output is expected to ease, with US frackers returning to the market as oil prices rise. Large stocks of oil are built up and are likely to be released into the market as prices rise. The demand side of the equation has recently been influenced by the stalling of emerging market growth, and the weakening USD has driven up the cost of the dollar-denominated commodity. In the long term, the industry's ability to find new oil reserves has been less successful, and the commitment to climate change targets adds uncertainty to the future of oil markets. In summary, the oil industry faces numerous challenges and influences from both production and demand sides, with rivalries within OPEC, US shale production, weakening USD, and the global commitment to climate change creating an uncertain environment for the market."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The bus, which was heading for Nairobi in Kenya , crashed in the Kabale district of Uganda near the Rwandan border.

His paternal great-great-great-grandfather emigrated from Balquhidder, Scotland, in 1825. Cameron grew up in Chippawa, Ontario, and attended Stamford Collegiate School in Niagara Falls, Ontario. His family moved to Brea, California in 1971, when Cameron was 17 years old. Context: After completing a screenplay for The Terminator, Cameron decided to sell it so that he could direct the movie. However, the production companies he contacted, while expressing interest in the project, were unwilling to let a largely inexperienced feature film director make the movie. Finally, Cameron found a company called Hemdale Pictures, which was willing to let him direct. Gale Anne Hurd, who had started her own production company, Pacific Western Productions, had previously worked with Cameron in Roger Corman's company and agreed to buy Cameron's screenplay for one dollar, on the condition that Cameron direct the film. Hurd was signed on as a producer, and Cameron finally got his first break as director. Orion Pictures distributed the film. Hurd and Cameron were married from 1985 to 1989. For the role of the Terminator, Cameron envisioned a man who was not exceptionally muscular, who could \\"blend into\\" a crowd. Lance Henriksen, who had starred in Piranha II: The Spawning, was considered for the title role, but when Arnold Schwarzenegger and Cameron first met over lunch to discuss Schwarzenegger's playing the role of Kyle Reese, both came to the conclusion that the cyborg villain would be the more compelling role for the Austrian bodybuilder; Henriksen got the smaller part of LAPD detective Hal Vukovich and the role of Kyle Reese went to Michael Biehn. In addition, Linda Hamilton first appeared in this film in her iconic role of Sarah Connor, and later married Cameron. The Terminator was a box-office hit, breaking expectations by Orion Pictures executives that the film would be regarded as no more than a sci-fi film, and then only last a week in theaters. It was a low-budget film which cost 6.5 million to make, cutting expenses in such ways as recording the audio track in mono. However, The Terminator eventually earned over 78 million worldwide. Question: Can you tell me any interesting information?. Whats the answer?","output":"Here's an interesting piece of information based on the context provided: When casting for the role of the Terminator, director James Cameron initially envisioned a man who was not exceptionally muscular and could \\"blend into\\" a crowd. However, when he met with Arnold Schwarzenegger to discuss the role of Kyle Reese, they both concluded that the cyborg villain would be a more compelling role for the Austrian bodybuilder. This decision led to Arnold Schwarzenegger becoming the iconic Terminator, which arguably played a significant role in shaping his acting career and the movie's success."},{"instruction":"Right after the Pentagon was hit, NEADS learned of another possible hijacked aircraft.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Who is the actor playing George Bailey? Title: It's a Wonderful Life Movie plot: This movie is about a divine intervention by a guardian angel, to help a man in distress. It opens with a a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. They are receiving prayers from mortals, like \\"Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy\\". George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's (Todd Karns) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr. Gower's (H.B. Warner) drug store, he prevents a mistake in a prescription from fatally poisoning someone.

How to sew clear vinyl Pick a sharp size 14 , 16, or 18 needle. Since some clear vinyls are thick, use a very sharp needle that can cut through the material. Use a leather needle size 14 or a universal needle in 16 or 18.","output":"Next, adjust your sewing machine settings accordingly. When sewing clear vinyl, it is essential to fine-tune your sewing machine for optimal performance. Begin by setting the stitch length to 3.0 or 3.5 mm to avoid creating holes too close together, which could cause the material to weaken or tear. It is also advisable to reduce the thread tension to prevent puckering or distortion in the vinyl. To further aid in smooth sewing, consider using a Teflon or non-stick presser foot, which will glide effortlessly over the vinyl without sticking. Alternatively, you can place tissue paper between the vinyl and the presser foot to minimize friction. To ensure the best possible outcome when stitching the clear vinyl, use a strong, high-quality polyester thread. Compared to cotton thread, polyester is more resilient and less likely to break when sewing through thick vinyl fabric. Additionally, before starting the sewing process, take a piece of scrap vinyl and test the stitch settings on it to confirm they are well-suited for the project. It is crucial to keep in mind that vinyl is a delicate material, and using pins to hold it in place could result in permanent holes. Instead, use sewing clips, painter's tape, or masking tape to secure the vinyl while sewing, ensuring that the tape doesn't interfere with your stitch line. Make sure to remove the tape gently to avoid damaging the fabric. Sewing clear vinyl can be a tricky process due to its unique composition, but with the right equipment, settings, and techniques, it is entirely manageable. By paying close attention to needle size, thread type, sewing machine adjustments, and fabric handling techniques, you can successfully complete your clear vinyl projects with ease. As you gain experience and confidence, you may find that sewing clear vinyl offers a wide range of possibilities in crafting, home décor, and fashion applications."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A hairdresser in a salon looking off through the salon.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A hairdresser contemplating in the salon she owns.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

This usually involves the following actions: 1. Firmly holding the prey: Once the owl has captured the rodent with its sharp talons, it ensures a tight grip to prevent the rodent from escaping. This is crucial as rodents can be agile and might attempt to wriggle free from the owl's clutches. 2. Killing the prey: If the prey is not killed instantly by the impact or the grip of the talons, the owl will deliver a swift bite to the neck or head of the rodent using its strong, sharp beak. This efficiently kills the prey, ensuring minimal suffering for the rodent and making the meal easier for the owl to handle. 3. Assessing the safety of the surroundings: Before consuming the prey, the owl will survey its surroundings to make sure that it is safe from potential predators or threats. This ensures that the owl will not be caught off-guard while consuming its meal and potentially lose its hard-earned catch. 4. Swallowing the prey whole or tearing it into smaller pieces: Depending on the size of the rodent, the owl may choose to swallow it whole or tear it into smaller pieces using its beak. Smaller prey such as mice can be swallowed whole, while larger prey such as rats may need to be disassembled. 5. Digesting and regurgitating the indigestible parts: After consuming its meal, the owl's digestive system starts to break down the rodent, absorbing the necessary nutrients. However, certain parts of the rodent, such as bones, fur, and feathers, cannot be digested. These indigestible parts form a pellet-like mass within the owl's stomach called a \\"casting,\\" which the owl will then regurgitate several hours after feeding. In conclusion, the final step in the process of hunting and capturing prey for an owl involves securely holding the rodent, killing it if necessary, ensuring a safe location for consumption, ingesting the meal, and eventually forming and regurgitating a casting. This allows the owl to efficiently and effectively obtain the vital nutrients it needs to survive and thrive in its nocturnal habitat."},{"instruction":"Given an abstract, indicate which of the provided candidate titles (Option1 and Option2) best describes it (respond with the text of the title, not option1/2).

Andre returned in the winter of 1990, but it was not to the World Wrestling Federation. Instead, Andre made an interview appearance for Herb Abrams' fledgling Universal Wrestling Federation on October 11th in Reseda, California. (the segment aired in 1991). He appeared in an interview segment with Captain Lou Albano and put over the UWF. The following month, on November 30th at a house show in Miami, Florida the World Wrestling Federation announced Andre's return as a participant in the 1991 Royal Rumble (to be held in Miami, FL two months later). Andre was also mentioned as a participant on television but would ultimately back out due to a leg injury. His on-air return finally came at WrestleMania VII, when he came to the aid of The Big Boss Man in his match against Mr. Perfect. Andre finally returned to action on April 26, 1991, in a six-man tag-team matchup when he teamed with the Rockers in a winning effort against Mr. Fuji and the Orient Express at a house show in Belfast, Northern Ireland. On May 10th he participated in a 17-man battle-royal at a house show in Detroit. (won by Kerry Von Erich). His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, Sensational Sherri, Slick, and Mr. Fuji) trying to recruit Andre one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (e.g. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to Andre and Mr. Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, Jimmy Hart appeared live on WWF Superstars to announce that he had successfully signed Andre to tag-team with Earthquake. However, when asked to confirm this by Gene Okerlund, Andre denied the claims. This led to Earthquake's attacking Andre from behind (injuring his knee). Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing Tugboat and forming the Natural Disasters. This led to Andre's final major WWF appearance at SummerSlam '91, where he seconded the Bushwhackers in their match against the Disasters. Andre was on crutches at ringside, and after the Disasters won the match, they set out to attack Andre, but the Legion of Doom made their way to ringside and got in between them and the Giant, who was preparing to defend himself with one of his crutches. The Disasters left the ringside area as they were outnumbered by the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers and Andre, who struck both Earthquake and Typhoon (the former Tugboat) with the crutch as they left. His final WWF appearance came at a house show in Paris, France, on October 9. He was in Davey Boy Smith's corner as the Bulldog faced Earthquake. Davey Boy hit Earthquake with Andre's crutch, allowing Smith to win.

At the center of the debate is Gammy, a seven-month-old Down Syndrome baby with a congenital heart condition who is currently receiving treatment for a lung infection at a private hospital in Thailand. For days, Gammy's surrogate mother, 21-year-old Thai food stall worker Pattharamon Chanbua, has been telling local and foreign press that the couple abandoned their son, taking home his healthy sister. After initially denying they knew about baby Gammy, a friend of the couple issued a statement to a local Australian newspaper saying the pair only left Gammy because they were told he was likely to die. \\"Gammy was very sick when he was born and the biological parents were told he would not survive and he had a day, at best, to live and to say goodbye,\\" the unnamed friend told the Bunbury Mail, in Western Australia, where the couple live. Fear and lies. The friend said the surrogate mother gave birth at a different hospital to the one agreed upon, which made the surrogacy agreement void. The couple was scared, she said, that Pattharamon would change her mind about the second child, and they'd have to leave Thailand with no children at all. According to the report, the friend noted that the backdrop to the surrogacy row was a military coup in the country and \\"it was very difficult to get around.\\" The takeover took place in the early hours of May 22, 2014 when Commander of the Royal Thai Army General Prayuth Chan-chua announced in a national broadcast he was now in charge. \\"This has been absolutely devastating for them, they are on the edge,\\" the friend added, referring to the days of media scrutiny and debate over their decision, months after they returned home. Pattharamon claimed the couple asked her to terminate the Down Syndrome child when she was seven months pregnant. Not true, the couple's friend said. After the babies' birth, Pattharamon claimed they bought nappies and milk for the baby girl, but \\"didn't even look at the boy.\\" Also a lie, the friend added. Whatever the details of who said what, the case has attracted attention to a largely unregulated industry subject to a confusing tangle of laws and loopholes. Surrogate 'is legal parent' In the state of Western Australia, where the couple is from, it's legal to seek surrogacy abroad. There are no checks for criminal history, and no counseling is required for couples seeking offshore surrogacy, said Jenni Millbank, an expert in Australian surrogacy law from the University of Technology in Sydney. \\"If surrogacy were taken onshore there would be counseling protocols prior to conception, as well as a welfare report after birth required before legal parentage is transferred; but these are not steps that occur with offshore surrogacy,\\" said Millbank. She said the surrogate mother is the legal parent regardless of whose egg was used. The rights of the genetic father are also \\"uncertain\\" as \\"different judges have taken varied approaches,\\" she said. Australian authorities are looking into the case, as are Thai authorities, who had already announced a crackdown on the industry amid claims rules were being flouted. Pattharamon said she agreed to be paid 300,000 baht (9,300) for carrying the couple's babies, money she needed to help care for her own two children, aged six and three. After she voiced concerns about how she was going to pay for Gammy's care, funds started flowing to an online campaign, which to date has raised more than 237,000 (US220,000). Could baby girl be returned? Pattharamon said she's prepared to take the baby girl back if the Australian couple is are \\"not ready\\" to take care of her. She said she doesn't intend to pursue legal action against the parents, though Millbank says she could apply to the Family Court of Australia to have the child returned. \\"The Family Court of Australia has jurisdiction over anyone who has an interest in the care, welfare and a development of a child so (the intending parents) could still make their case and argue for the baby to live with them,\\" Millbank said. \\"The court would examine the competitive proposals of the parties, probably appoint an independent children's lawyer and do a welfare assessment of the child's needs and then make a decision.\\" The Australian courts have only ever heard one case involving a child born via surrogacy, Millbank said. It involved a child called \\"Evelyn\\" whose birth was the result of an agreement between friends that went wrong. \\"That was in the 1980s and they ended up removing the child from the family that had been raising her and taking her to the other family,\\" Millbank said. \\"It was an altruistic arrangement where the birth mother changed her mind about seven months later. And she ultimately won. She got the child back.\\"","output":"A baby named Gammy was born with Down Syndrome and a heart condition to a Thai surrogate mother named Pattharamon. The biological parents, a couple from Australia, brought home Gammy's twin sister but left Gammy behind. At first, the couple claimed they did not know about Gammy, but later a friend said they believed he would die. This situation has raised questions about surrogacy laws and the care of children born with disabilities. Both Australian and Thai authorities are investigating the case. There has been a lot of debate and confusion about what really happened, but many people have donated money to help Gammy receive the medical care he needs."},{"instruction":"Given the background: Making these healthy lifestyle choices can also help prevent some types of cancer.

Collectively, they form the backbone of law and order, governing how justice is enacted and how legal matters are handled by various participants in the judiciary, ranging from lawyers, judges, to court clerks andlitigants. A court signifies more than just a physical location; it represents an integral part of the legal system where judicial proceedings and legal disputes are heard and resolved. It is a formal, structured environment wherein the law is interpreted, and judgments are pronounced based on evidence and the legal merit of cases. The court serves the vital function of upholding the law, maintaining societal order, and dispensing justice by impartially deciding on civil and criminal matters. The concept of a document in the legal sense refers to physical or electronic records that furnish information or evidence pertinent to legal proceedings. Legal documents can present in various forms, including but not limited to affidavits, pleadings, motions, contracts, wills, leases, and laws. They contain legal facts, testimonies, arguments, obligations, rights, or provisions that directly or indirectly influence the direction and outcome of a lawsuit. Often, these documents are scrupulously crafted by legal professionals to ensure their legality, relevancy, and admissibility in court. On the other hand, a file (or a court file) in a legal setting is a comprehensive compendium of all the relevant court documents pertaining to a specific case. 'Filing' is a procedural act of submitting documents to the court clerk, an action that makes a document an official part of the court record. Legal files systematically organize and store all kinds of legal paperwork - such as claims, defenses, motions, evidence, court orders, and judgments - that are successively filed over the lifecycle of a lawsuit. These files serve as an authoritative source of information for judges, lawyers, and parties involved in a case, providing them with critical insights into the facts, procedural history, and statuses of the case. In conclusion, court, document, and file are pivotal elements of the legal and judicial systems. They facilitate the process of law enforcement and the delivery of justice by establishing a formal venue for legal disputes resolution (court), providing information and evidence (documents), and keeping a systematic record of legal proceedings (files)."},{"instruction":"Translate from English to Spanish: Secondary bacterial infections are also commonly associated with vitamin D toxicity.","output":"1.

Local astronomer Ted Lewis (Eric McCormack) is making a special anniversary dinner for his wife Lana (Jody Thompson). A local diner waitress, Tammy (Jenni Baird) is in her trailer painting a horse scene while Dick (Andrew Dunbar) and Penny (Sarah Smyth) are necking at lovers lane. All are watching the light show from the annual August Perseid meteor showers when suddenly there is a blinding light and crash into the butte just outside of town. Ted attempts to investigate but Lana prevails in keeping him home at least until she falls asleep and he can sneak out to the crash site. In the meantime we see a gruesome alien creature (The Ghota) leaving the spaceship to slip away into the night. Soon after, a tall alien in a silvery metallic suit (Urp) appears from the ship. When Ted arrives at the butte he does not discover a smoking red-hot meteorite but rather a flying saucer imbedded in the hillside with its ramp down. He cautiously enters the saucer and is snatched up by the mysterious silver alien.Townspeople soon start disappearing everywhere and the only remnant at the scene is a puddle of gurgling mud. Ted Lewis, having been body snatched by Urp, is now on the trail of the murderous Ghota. Urp, is actually a galactic Federal Marshal from another planet who was transporting the Ghota when his saucer crashed landed and the Ghota escaped. He needs to find and recapture the creature before it begins to divide or it will multiply exponentially until all life is consumed on planet Earth. After unsuccessfully trying to convince Lana to help him find the Ghota, Urp meets Tammy on the highway when she offers him a lift.

I used to wish like hell that she wasn't my cousin. When she was fifteen Trisha started putting out for the boys in the Kwik-Save car park for a tenner a time. She said she was an entrepreneur, not a prostitute. She started going steady with a kid called Keith. He was a fryer in the fish and chip shop. He had a future and a Ford Cortina. She got a job waitressing and she worked all the hours she could. Keith couldn't handle me and Trisha being as close as we were. Especially the time he caught Trisha bending over me in nothing but a frilly market stall thong while I worked the angles best I could to get a dangle-shot. Next night he took her in the car park woods and doped her up to the eyeballs. He took out a bottle of India ink and told her he would etch the love-heart she'd always wanted. Instead, he safety-pinned the word 'inbred' into her arse. Trisha's step-dad tracked the spits of blood and found her sobbing in the bathroom of their long-stay static. It didn't take him long to slap out the truth. He went straight round to Keith's place with a crow-bar and did enough damage to make sure he'd need more than laser treatment to put things right. Keith wasn't rolling in spare change so Trisha's step-dad took the Cortina as payment in lieu of her getting herself fixed up.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more oxygen gets released happens, how will it affect MORE solar power being generated. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mention involves an increase in the release of oxygen and its potential effect on solar power generation. To examine this, let's first understand that oxygen is released mainly through the process of photosynthesis in plants and has no direct role in the photovoltaic (PV) process. The PV process, as you have mentioned, involves photons from sunlight exciting electrons in semiconductor materials and generating an electric current. The flow of these electrons through an external circuit provides the electric power output from the PV cell. This process does not involve the interaction with oxygen molecules. Now, let's consider if there is any indirect effect of increased oxygen release on solar power generation. Released oxygen contributes to the Earth's atmosphere. However, solar radiation is mainly affected by atmospheric factors like cloud cover, humidity, and air pollution. Oxygen, being a natural component of the atmosphere, does not have a significant impact on these factors. Therefore, an increase in the release of oxygen is unlikely to have any notable indirect effect on solar power generation. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation you mentioned – the release of more oxygen – does not have a direct or significant indirect effect on the solar power generation process. The performance of a photovoltaic cell remains primarily determined by the intensity of sunlight and the efficiency of the PV cell itself."},{"instruction":"Information: - Blu-ray or Blu-ray Disc (BD) is a digital optical disc data storage format. It was designed to supersede the DVD format, in that it is capable of storing high-definition (720p and 1080p) and ultra high-definition video resolution (2160p). The plastic disc is 120 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm thick, the same size as DVDs and CDs. Conventional (pre-BD-XL) Blu-ray Disc discs contain 25 GB per layer, with dual layer discs (50 GB) being the industry standard for feature-length video discs. Triple-layer discs (100 GB) and quadruple layers (128 GB) are available for \\"BD-XL\\" re-writer drives. The name \\"Blu-ray\\" refers to the blue laser (specifically, a violet laser) used to read the disc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs. The main application of Blu-ray is as a medium for video material such as feature films and physical distribution of video games for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Besides the hardware specifications, Blu-ray is associated with a set of multimedia formats. - Sharon Janny den Adel (born 12 July 1974) is a Dutch singer, songwriter and fashion designer, best known as the lead vocalist and one of the main songwriters in the Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation.

Some DVD players will also play audio CDs. DVD players are connected to a television to watch the DVD content, which could be a movie, a recorded TV show, or other content. - , formerly known as , is a Japanese multinational electronics corporation headquartered in Kadoma, Osaka, Japan. - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - Koninklijke Philips N.V. (Royal Philips, commonly known as Philips) is a Dutch technology company headquartered in Amsterdam with primary divisions focused in the areas of electronics, healthcare and lighting. It was founded in Eindhoven in 1891, by Gerard Philips and his father Frederik. It is one of the largest electronics companies in the world and employs around 105,000 people across more than 60 countries. - Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services. These make Sony one of the most comprehensive entertainment companies in the world. Sony's principal business operations include Sony Corporation, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Mobile (formerly Sony Ericsson) and Sony Financial. Sony is among the Semiconductor sales leaders by year and as of 2013, the fourth-largest television manufacturer in the world, after Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and TCL. - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. - High-definition video is video of higher resolution and quality than standard-definition. While there is no standardized meaning for \\"high-definition\\", generally any video image with considerably more than 480 horizontal lines (North America) or 576 horizontal lines (Europe) is considered high-definition. 480 scan lines is generally the minimum even though the majority of systems greatly exceed that. Images of standard resolution captured at rates faster than normal (60 frames/second North America, 50 fps Europe), by a high-speed camera may be considered high-definition in some contexts. Some television series shot on high-definition video are made to look as if they have been shot on film, a technique which is often known as filmizing. - Black Symphony is a live album , DVD and Blu - ray Disc from Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation . It was released worldwide on September 22 -- 24 , 2008 and is available on 2 - disc DVD , 2 - disc CD , and Blu - ray . - Toshiba was founded in 1938 as Tokyo Shibaura Electric K.K. through the merger of Shibaura Seisaku-sho (founded in 1875) and Tokyo Denki (founded in 1890). The company name was officially changed to Toshiba Corporation in 1978. Toshiba made a large number of corporate acquisitions during its history, including of Semp in 1977, of Westinghouse Electric LLC, a nuclear energy company in 2006, of Landis+Gyr in 2011, and of IBM's point-of-sale business in 2012. - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - 3VOOR12 is a multimedia platform of the Netherlands Public Broadcasting VPRO for alternative pop. - Delain is a Dutch symphonic metal band formed in 2002 by former Within Temptation keyboardist Martijn Westerholt, and Charlotte Wessels. The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\". - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - DVD (an abbreviation of \\"digital versatile disc\\" or \\"digital video disc\\") is a digital optical disc storage format invented and developed by Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Panasonic in 1995. The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - The PlayStation 3 (abbreviated as PS3) is a home video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the successor to PlayStation 2, and is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles. It competed with Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. It was first released on November 11, 2006, in Japan, November 17, 2006 in North America, and March 27, 2007 in Europe and Australia. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - Robert Westerholt (born 2 January 1975 in Waddinxveen, South Holland, Netherlands) is a Dutch musician, known as the guitarist, unclean vocalist and co-founder of the symphonic metal band Within Temptation. He also writes music for the band along with his partner and band vocalist Sharon den Adel. He used to work in human resource management before his career with Within Temptation. - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\". - A choir (also known as a chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers. Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the Medieval era to the present, and/or popular music repertoire. Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm and face gestures. - A film score (also sometimes called background score, background music, movie soundtrack, film music or incidental music) is original music written specifically to accompany a film. The score forms part of the film's soundtrack, which also usually includes dialogue and sound effects, and comprises a number of orchestral, instrumental, or choral pieces called cues, which are timed to begin and end at specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question. Scores are written by one or more composers, under the guidance of, or in collaboration with, the film's director or producer and are then usually performed by an ensemble of musicians most often comprising an orchestra or band, instrumental soloists, and choir or vocalists and recorded by a sound engineer.

The Halloween & Costume Organization just launched a campaign to move Halloween to the last Saturday of October, and lots of families have already hopped on board. The trade group argues that a weekend celebration would allow for greater parental supervision and child safety by trick-or-treating during daylight hours — not to mention more time to celebrate without the stress of the work or school week. \\"We feel the change is inevitable and that in the end, the logic behind creating a safer, longer Halloween will prevail,\\" HCA Chairman Kevin Johnson said in a statement. So far the group's efforts have garnered more than 900 signatures on Change.org. The holiday's fixed date stems from its religious origins in the eighth century, when Pope Gregory III declared November 1 as a day to honor all saints. A tradition then developed to celebrate the dead on the preceding night, which later became what we know today as Halloween. Despite its religious roots, most Americans currently treat October 31 as a commercial holiday — and some parents think moving it to a Saturday would make life a lot easier for them and their kids. Let's start by breaking down the positives, shall we? The Pros It's easier for parents to celebrate with their kids versus rushing home after work. Children could trick-or-treat during daylight hours when it's potentially safer. You could spend the whole day celebrating instead of a few hours at night. Kids can still get a good night's sleep after staying out late. The Cons But before we do anything too crazy, don't forget: The U.S. has celebrated Halloween on October 31st since the mid-19th century. Halloween literally means \\"All Hallows' Eve\\" — a.k.a. the night before November 1. Half the fun of Halloween as kid is staying up late on a school night. You just can't mess with tradition! So there you have it. Fair warning though: Right now the government does not recognize Halloween as a federal holiday, so not only would Congress have to pass a law adding it to the official calendar, but they'd also have to agree on when to celebrate it. Getting any kind of consensus out of Washington right now is a lot easier said than done, but if you really love Halloween, it might be worth a shot. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The Halloween & Costume Association has launched a campaign to move Halloween to the last Saturday of October, with the objective of allowing for greater parental supervision and child safety during trick-or-treating.

Jack and Sarah are expecting a baby together, but a complication during the birth leads to the death of Sarah. Jack, grief-stricken, goes on an alcoholic bender, leaving his daughter to be taken care of by his parents and Sarah's mother, until they decide to take drastic action: they return the baby to Jack whilst he is asleep, leaving him to take care of it. Although he struggles initially, he eventually begins to dote on the child and names her Sarah. Despite this, he nevertheless finds it increasingly difficult to juggle bringing up the baby with his high-powered job, and though both sets of the child's grandparents lend a hand (along with William, a dried out ex-alcoholic who, once sober, proves to be a remarkably efficient babysitter and housekeeper), he needs more help. Amy, an American waitress he meets in a restaurant who takes a shine to Sarah, takes up the role as nanny, moving in with Jack after one meeting.

Research about raising chickens: Before getting started, it's essential to gather information about different breeds, their specific requirements, and the challenges involved in raising chickens. This will help you make informed decisions throughout the process. 2. Determine your purpose: Decide why you want to raise chickens. Some people raise chickens for eggs, others for meat, and some just to keep as pets. Your purpose will dictate your choice of breed, coop size, and management practices. 3. Choose the right breed: Select a breed suitable for your purpose and local climate. Consider factors such as egg-laying frequency, temperament, hardiness, and growth rate. 4. Prepare the space: Chickens require a safe, clean, and adequately sized living environment. Design a coop and outdoor run that provide protection from predators, shelter from the elements, and enough space for the chickens to roam and roost (minimum of 10 square feet per bird). 5. Acquire supplies: Purchase or build a feeder and waterer, food storage container, bedding material, nesting boxes, and roosting bars. You'll also need chicken feed formulated for the particular age and purpose of your birds. 6. Purchase and transport chickens: Obtain your chickens from a reputable breeder, hatchery, or local farmer. Transport chicks or adult birds in a secure, well-ventilated container and practice proper biosecurity measures during the process. 7. Get the right feed: Feed your chickens an appropriate diet, consisting of a balanced poultry feed that contains necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. The type of feed depends on the age and purpose of your birds. 8. Maintain cleanliness: Regularly clean the coop, replacing bedding material, and removing droppings. This helps prevent diseases, keeps odor under control, and provides a comfortable environment for your chickens. 9. Ensure health and safety: Monitor your chickens' health and provide necessary vaccinations. Familiarize yourself with common chicken ailments to quickly address any issues. 10. Gain experience and engage with the community: Consult experienced chicken keepers, join online poultry forums, or visit local poultry clubs to continually learn and seek advice.

To get the most pleasure out of your small garden, plant your favorite vegetables. Many vegetables come in dwarf sizes such as tomatoes and eggplants.","output":"These compact varieties allow you to maximize your space while still enjoying the delicious produce you crave. It's important to carefully plan your garden layout, taking into consideration the specific requirements of each vegetable. Utilize vertical space by incorporating trellises, stakes, or cages for crops like peas, beans, and cucumbers to climb, as this not only saves space but also increases air circulation and sun exposure. Another space-saving trick is to use square foot gardening, which is a method of dividing your garden into one-foot square sections, allowing you to determine exactly how many plants can fit in a given area, without overcrowding. Planting in succession can also be extremely beneficial, as it enables you to consistently harvest fresh vegetables throughout the growing season. By timing your planting so that as one crop is harvested, another can be planted in its place, you can quickly replenish your garden and enjoy a continuous supply of your favorite vegetables. Interplanting, or combining crops with complementary growth habits, is another useful technique. For instance, planting fast-growing, shallow-rooted plants like radishes or lettuce alongside slower-growing, deeper-rooted vegetables such as carrots or tomatoes can help you optimize your limited garden space. Take advantage of containers for more flexibility if your garden space is limited or if it lacks proper soil quality. Containers offer the perfect opportunity to grow a wide range of vegetables just about anywhere – on your patio, porch, or balcony. Remember to select containers with proper drainage and ensure the container size is appropriate for the vegetable you're growing. You can even choose self-watering containers to minimize maintenance. Further, using high-quality, well-draining potting soil with the right nutrients will set your vegetables up for success. Good plant care, which includes proper watering, fertilization, and pest control, is essential to your small garden's success. Maintaining a consistent watering schedule and monitoring your plants for any signs of stress or pests can help you address issues early on, ensuring healthy growth. Regularly applying organic fertilizers or compost can provide your vegetables with the necessary nutrients for optimal growth. Additionally, practicing crop rotation – even on a small scale – can help minimize soil-borne diseases, pests, and nutrient depletion. Lastly, don't forget to keep a garden journal to track your progress, plant varieties, successes, and challenges. This valuable tool will help you continuously refine your small garden's layout, growing techniques, and plant selections, ensuring that each season becomes even more fruitful and enjoyable than the last. With careful planning, resourceful use of space, and attentive plant care, you can create a thriving vegetable garden in even the smallest of spaces, bringing you endless joy and satisfaction through the art of homegrown produce."},{"instruction":"I ' m thrilled , so thrilled , that he loves his teacher .

The passage quotes Peter Vesterbacka, stating, \\"As a kind of online game, it is popular with people of all ages. It's really an interesting game. And the parks will be interesting places for everyone around the world,\\" said Peter Vesterbacka, an officer of Angry Birds Company. The quoted text clearly indicates that Peter Vesterbacka holds a position within the Angry Birds Company, making option B the correct choice among the provided options. The passage provides information about the Angry Birds-themed activity parks that are set to open worldwide. It mentions that the first two parks opened in Finland, and more parks are planned to open in the UK. Nevertheless, the passage does not mention when exactly the parks will open in the UK, ruling out option D as a correct answer. Regarding option A, the passage states, \\"As a kind of online game, it is popular with people of all ages,\\" which contradicts the assertion that Angry Birds is only popular among young people. Thus, option A is incorrect. As for option C, the passage directly contradicts this statement when it says, \\"People can also play the Angry Birds game on large screens in the park.\\" This clearly means there are screens available in the Angry Birds-themed activity parks, rendering option C incorrect. Hence, based on the information provided in the passage, the correct answer is B: Peter Vesterbacka works for Angry Birds Company."},{"instruction":"Answer this question: who plays max on the secret life of pets??","output":"Max, the main dog character in the movie \\"The Secret Life of Pets,\\" is voiced by an actor named Louis C.K. in the first movie, and by a different actor named Patton Oswalt in the second movie.

Article: There was a young man named Bill in England. Before leaving school, he began to look for a job as a clerk. Few companies needed new clerks due to the financial crisis at that time. It became harder and harder to find a job. Luckily, a chance camp up to him. A company wanted to employ one person. He and the other twenty people joined in the first interview. After that, three persons were allowed to enter the final test which would decide one person to be employed in the end. Bill was lucky to be among them. On the day of the second interview, Bill and the others arrived at the company on time. To their surprise, the interview was very easy. The interviewer only had a free talk with them, and then asked them to go back home waiting for the result. The next morning, Bill received a letter from the company which said he wasn't accepted. Certainly, he felt disappointed. On the evening of that day, Bill surprisingly received another letter, which said he was employed. But why was he accepted? As a matter of fact, the first letter sent to Bill was also part of the test. Every one of them got a letter which had the same meaning that morning. Only Bill replied with \\"Thank you\\" while the others said nothing. Life isn't all fun. There is always something making us unhappy. When you feel disappointed, please say \\"Thank you\\" to the person who disappoints you. That shows your great generosity and politeness to others. If you do so, you'll have more chances than others. Question: In this article, the writer mainly wants to _ . Options: A: show how hard it was to find a job during the financial crisis at that time B: share an unhappy experience with the readers C: tell about how strict it was to employ one person D: teach us the importance of great generosity and politeness to others. The answer to this question is:","output":"D: teach us the importance of great generosity and politeness to others. In the article, the story of Bill searching for a job during the financial crisis serves as a backdrop to highlight the main message the writer wants to convey. Although the difficulties in finding a job and the strict employment process are discussed, they are not the primary focus of the article. The crucial turning point in the story is when Bill receives two letters - one that disappoints him and the other that gives him good news. Bill's response of \\"Thank you\\" after receiving the disappointing letter sets him apart from the other candidates and leads to his employment. The writer uses this moment to emphasize the importance of great generosity and politeness, even in the face of disappointment. By demonstrating that Bill's politeness led to his success, the writer aims to teach the readers the significance of maintaining good manners and how it can positively impact one's life.

By Louise Boyle Kato Kaelin, the bit-part actor who became famous overnight as OJ Simpson's house-guest at the time of his ex-wife's murder, has revealed that OJ tried to persuade him to provide an alibi for that fatal night 20 years ago. On the 20th anniversary of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, Kaelin spoke to Today along with the father and sister of Mr Goldman. The pair were found brutally stabbed to death at Ms Brown Simpson's LA home on June 12, 1994. Kaelin was staying in a guest house at OJ Simpson's compound and was present at the time the murders took place. He appeared as a prosecution witness at OJ's murder trial before a rapt but unforgiving public where he was criticized for his rambling, arrogant testimony and dubbed a 'beach bum' and 'parasitic freeloader'. Nicole Brown-","output":"Simpson's brutal murder, along with that of her friend Ron Goldman, will forever remain etched in public memory as one of the most shocking and tragic events of the 20th century. The events of that fateful night, as well as the ensuing murder trial, captivated the attention of millions and marked an indelible turning point in the lives of all those involved. Kato Kaelin's association with OJ Simpson and his presence during the time of the murders made him a key figure in the investigation and the subsequent trial. As he spoke to Today, Kaelin was open about the burden that his newfound fame placed on him and the emotional toll he suffered. Kaelin revealed that OJ Simpson had tried to convince him to provide a false alibi for the night of the murders. Despite the pressure, Kaelin decided not to comply with Simpson's request as he realized the significance of the testimony he would have to give at the trial. He was determined to tell the truth, even if it meant putting his own safety and reputation at stake. Over the years, Kato Kaelin has been criticized for his attitude in the courtroom and labeled as a 'beach bum' and 'parasitic freeloader'. However, his decision to stand up against OJ's manipulative tactics showed immense courage and dedication to seeking justice for Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. As the Today interview continued, the father and sister of Ron Goldman, Fred and Kim, expressed their gratitude to Kato Kaelin for his candid remarks and his unwavering commitment to bringing closure to their family. The Goldmans acknowledged that they would never have known the truth about what happened that horrifying night without Kaelin's willingness to share his story. Twenty years after the murders, the cloud of suspicion and controversy that surrounded OJ Simpson's trial remains as potent as ever. Yet, in the midst of this unresolved pain and tumult, Kato Kaelin stands out as a figure who chose to put truth and accountability above self-preservation and convenience. As the interview concluded, it was strikingly evident that the lives of those touched by the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman have remained forever altered. The tragedy has come to define them in different ways, shaping the paths they have chosen to take in their search for justice and closure. Kato Kaelin's unwavering dedication to fulfill his responsibilities as a witness and his refusal to provide a false alibi for OJ Simpson continue to remind the world of the darker side of celebrity and the lengths some individuals will go in order to preserve their image and public standing. And although the ending of this tragic tale is marred with pain, disillusionment, and loss, Kato Kaelin's courage and integrity hold out a glimmer of hope that, in the midst of darkness, the pursuit of truth and justice can still prevail."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"Identify an HDMI-compatible port on your non-HDMI device. Choose the right cable or adapter. Connect the HDMI-A plug into a port on the TV. Connect the other end of the cable to the device or adapter. Switch to the HDMI source on your TV. Hook up the audio separately if necessary.\\"","output":"Title: The Comprehensive Guide to HDMI Connection on Non-HDMI Devices In today’s rapidly evolving digital world, HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) has emerged as the near-ubiquitous standard for audio and video transmission. This powerful one-cable solution has largely simplified our home and work theatres, gaming systems, and PC monitors. However, what if you have a non-HDMI device that you wish to connect to your HDMI-equipped TV or monitor? The following is a detailed guide to establishing an HDMI connection on tech gadgets that don't inherently support it. To start, you must first identify an HDMI-compatible port on your non-HDMI gadget. Often, the key lies in understanding the port options available on your specific device. For monitors, computers, or similar devices, options might include DVI (Digital Visual Interface), VGA (Video Graphics Array), or DisplayPort ports. In the case of gaming consoles or DVD players, you could discover ports such as SCART or Component Video. The goal is to identify the highest quality output port available. Typically, an HDMI-compatible port is one that can transfer both audio and video signals, although this doesn’t strictly have to be the case. Once you’ve identified a potential port, the next step is choosing the correct cable or adapter. An adapter or converter will be required to change the signal from your device into one that can be read by your HDMI TV or monitor. These are available in various forms such as DVI-to-HDMI or VGA-to-HDMI, each tailored to specific connection needs. Besides, there are even multi-adapters available that can cover a range of different port types. When purchasing a cable or adapter, it is essential to ensure that it matches the port on your device. Next, you will connect the HDMI-A plug into a port on the TV. HDMI-A is the standard plug type, identifiable by its trapezoid shape. Most HDTVs and monitors are equipped with an HDMI-A port, making it a universal solution. Always insert the plug carefully to avoid damaging the pins. The fourth step is to connect the other end of the cable or adapter to the device in question. This can range from a VGA port on a projector to a DVI port on a computer monitor. Again, ensure that the connections are secure to guarantee a clear signal. Following this, you must switch the TV or monitor to the right HDMI source. When the device is connected via HDMI, it may take a moment for the TV to detect the new input. Once the connection is established, navigate to your TV settings and select the relevant HDMI input (for instance, HDMI 1, HDMI 2, and so forth) as the source. Finally, because older technology devices or analog ones might not transmit audio over HDMI, hooking up the audio connection separately may be necessary. A typical method involves using a separate audio cable which connects the audio output of the device to the audio input of your TV or speaker system. Typically, a 3.5mm audio cable or RCA audio cable is commonly used for this purpose. To summarize, while it may seem challenging at first, establishing an HDMI connection on non-HDMI devices involves a series of straightforward steps. By identifying an HDMI-compatible port, choosing the right cable, and correctly establishing the connection, you can enjoy high-quality audio and video on your HDMI-ready TV or monitor from various devices, irrespective of their native support for HDMI. Remember, when you encounter any challenges, the user manuals or online forums related to your specific device can be crucial tools in troubleshooting any issues. However, with careful attention to each step, you'll be able to effectively connect and enjoy your non-HDMI devices to the full."},{"instruction":"1.

Johnny Hooker, a grifter in Joliet, Illinois, cons 11,000 in cash (187,600 today) in a pigeon drop from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to teach him \\"the big con\\". Unfortunately, their victim was a numbers racket courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hookerâs cut. Having already spent his share, Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills. Lonnegan's men murder both the courier and Luther, and Hooker flees for his life to Chicago. Hooker finds Henry Gondorff, a once-great con-man now hiding from the FBI, and asks for his help in taking on the dangerous Lonnegan. Gondorff is initially reluctant, but he relents and recruits a core team of experienced con men to con Lonnegan. They decide to resurrect an elaborate and supposedly obsolete scam known as \\"the wire\\", using a larger crew of con artists to create a phony off-track betting parlor. Aboard the opulent 20th Century Limited, Gondorff, posing as boorish Chicago bookie Shaw, buys into Lonnegan's private, high-stakes poker game. Shaw infuriates Lonnegan with his obnoxious behavior, then out-cheats him to win 15,000. Hooker, posing as Shaw's disgruntled employee, Kelly, is sent to collect the winnings and instead convinces Lonnegan that he wants to take over Shaw's operation. Kelly reveals that he has a partner named Les Harmon (actually con man Kid Twist) in the Chicago Western Union office, who will allow them to win bets on horse races by past-posting.

As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

While some critics have noted a feminist perspective in her writing, her popularity has been posthumously marred by multiple accusations against her of child sexual abuse and rape by two of her children, Mark and Moira Greyland, among many others. Zimmer Bradley's first child, David R. Bradley, and her brother, Paul Edwin Zimmer, also became published science fiction and fantasy authors. In 2014, her daughter, Moira Greyland, accused her of sexual abuse from the age of three to 12. In an email to The Guardian, Greyland said that she had not spoken out before because: I thought that my mother's fans would be angry with me for saying anything against someone who had championed women's rights and made so many of them feel differently about themselves and their lives. I didn't want to hurt anyone she had helped, so I just kept my mouth shut. Greyland also claimed that she was not the only victim and that she was one of the people who reported her father, Walter H. Breen, for child molestation, for which he received multiple convictions. By her own admission, Bradley was aware of her husband's behavior although she chose not to report him. In response to these allegations, on July 2, 2014, Victor Gollancz Ltd, the publisher of Bradley's digital backlist, announced that it will donate all income from the sales of Bradley's e-books to the charity Save the Children. The author Janni Lee Simner, who has continued to write works in Bradley's Darkover series, announced on June 13, 2014 that she would be donating advances from her two Darkover books, her Darkover royalties and at the request of her husband, Larry Hammer, payment for his sale to Bradley's magazine, to the American anti-sexual assault organization Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. Since the allegations were made public, Greyland and her brother Mark have spoken at length about their experiences and a number of famous science fiction authors have publicly condemned Bradley. Among the first was John Scalzi, who within a day of the allegations being made public, described the allegations as \\"horrific\\". Hugo Award winner Jim C. Hines wrote \\"All of which makes the revelations about Marion Zimmer Bradley protecting a known child rapist and molesting her own daughter and others even more tragic.\\" G Willow Wilson, World Fantasy award winner, said she was \\"speechless\\". Diana L. Paxson, who collaborated with Bradley on a number of novels and who continued to write novels set in the Avalon Series after Bradley's death, said that she was \\"shocked and appalled to read Moira Greyland's posts about her mother.\\" did anyone go to jail?","output":"Walter H.

Firstly, a sporting goods store is a type of retail business specializing in offering goods related to sports and physical activities. They sell a wide range of sports equipment, which would include all type of hockey equipment like jerseys, gloves, skates, and of course, pucks. They offer customers the ability to buy these items outright, new, and in a variety of brands and qualities. Optionally, let's analyze the other options: - \\"Hockey rink\\" and \\"ice hockey game\\": These two options are locations where pucks will certainly be found, but typically, pucks used in these scenes belong to the specific team or event organizers. They are not generally available for sale to the public, and taking one without permission could be considered theft. - \\"Arcade\\": While an arcade might have a hockey-themed game where players use a puck-like object, this isn't the same type of puck used in actual hockey games. They are often made of plastic or lighter materials and aren't meant for real play. - \\"Locker room\\": Like the hockey rink and ice hockey game, the locker room will have pucks present, but these belong to the teams and aren't available for public purchase.

Orleans Parish magistrate Harry Cantrell on Tuesday set a bail hearing for next Monday regarding an illegal weapons charge – Durst had a revolver on him when he was detained in the lobby of a Marriott hotel – and a second count of marijuana possession. Robert Durst: police search Houston apartment in murder case Read more Those charges pale in comparison to the killing of Durst’s friend Susan Berman, who was gunned down in her home in Los Angeles two days before Christmas in 2000. Berman’s is one of three mysterious deaths that Durst, the one-time heir to a New York real estate fortune, has been close to over the past 33 years. Durst was officially charged on Monday with her murder. It was not immediately clear why New Orleans wanted to pursue its own case against Durst, but the unexpected hold-up offered an opening for Durst’s team of attorneys. They have already been on warpath over The Jinx, the documentary series that appears to have played a significant role – disputed by the LAPD – in breaking open the dormant investigation into Berman’s killing and featured a possible confession from Durst in its concluding episode, which aired on Sunday. Durst’s lead attorney, Dick DeGuerin, told reporters on the courthouse steps in New Orleans that he would take advantage of the delay in extradition proceedings to fight the basis of Durst’s arrest even before he leaves Louisiana. “My concern is that the warrant that was issued in California was issued because of a television show and not because of facts,” DeGuerin said. “We’re going to get to contest that warrant here in Louisiana because of the Louisiana authorities’ determining to file charges here.” While legal experts said it was extremely unlikely that Durst could see the charges dropped before being extradited – an extradition his lawyers have already said he will not contest – DeGuerin seemed to relish the opportunity to give his defence strategy a dress rehearsal and accuse his adversaries of letting a television programme dictate what 15 years of inconclusive police investigation could not. “His arrest,” DeGuerin said, “is not based on facts. It’s based on ratings.” The Los Angeles police department has already hit back against the notion that the arrest was timed to coincide with the airing of the documentary. Their version of events is that they have built a case against Durst based on months of renewed investigation. “We didn’t base anything we did on the HBO series,” the LAPD deputy chief Kirk Albanese told the Los Angeles Times. “The arrest was made as a result of the investigative efforts and at a time that we believe it was needed.” The producers of The Jinx have denied they had any deal with law enforcement or that they knew when Durst’s arrest was coming. Nobody has produced evidence to the contrary. Questions have been raised, however, over the timeline of events as presented in the last episode of The Jinx. In a dramatic final interview for the show, Durst was presented with an envelope he had addressed to Susan Berman which bore many similarities to an anonymous note mailed to the Beverly Hills police on the day of Berman’s murder. Durst at first acknowledged the similarity but denied being the killer. He then went to the bathroom with his microphone still switched on, and in a conversation to himself appeared to suggest the jig was up. “What a disaster,” he said. “What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.” Andrew Jarecki, the director of the documentary, has already faced questions about how long he waited before handing over the envelope and the audio recording in the bathroom to police. He acknowledged in an interview with CBS – one of his only interviews since the finale aired – that there was a delay of several months but said that was because it took that long for his team to stumble on the bathroom audio for themselves. Now there appears to be a separate problem of presentation in the documentary itself. The final episode strongly suggested the interview occurred in the autumn of 2013 and that Durst, having resisted being reinterviewed, finally consented because he needed the film-makers’ help in a legal spat with his brother. But the New York Times has reported for two days now that according to its sources the interview occurred as long as 18 months previously. This is the kind of inconsistency that, if proven correct, defence lawyers feast on. It is already doubtful whether Durst’s bathroom ramblings constitute a confession that can stand up in court – one law professor, Laurie Levenson of Loyola Law School Los Angeles, said it was not a confession but a “reckless statement”. If DeGuerin can show there are other problems with it, he may seek to undermine its reliability further. Jarecki and his producing partner, Marc Smerling, ducked the timeline question in an interview with the New York Times published on Monday and then cancelled a slew of other interviews. They put out a statement saying it was no longer appropriate to speak to the media because they could be called as witnesses if Durst goes to trial for the murder of Susan Berman. HBO, meanwhile, would not answer questions from the Guardian about when they did a deal with Jarecki and Smerling and when it was decided to do the documentary in six parts – questions that might clarify when the film-makers knew how good their material was going to be. HBO said only that “we believe the relevant information was turned over to the authorities in a timely and responsible manner”. ||||| AP Karen Mitchell of Eureka, Calif., was last seen Nov. 25, 1997. Robert Durst may be connected to her disappearance, police said. Enlarge FBI 18-year-old Kristen Modafferi disappeared after leaving work in San Francisco on June 23, 1997. Robert Durst was said to be living in the area at the time. Enlarge Two teenage girls who went missing in California 18 years ago could come back to haunt Robert Durst. Detectives searching for Karen Mitchell and Kristen Modafferi took a look at the mysterious Manhattan real estate scion back in 2003 when he was on trial in Galveston, Tex., for murdering and dismembering his neighbor. Now that Durst will soon be heading back to Los Angeles to face a charge of murdering old friend Susan Berman in 2000, the search for 16-year-old Mitchell is back on the front burner, said an author who has covered Durst for years. “Karen Mitchell's family spoke with the FBI as recently as a few months ago,” said Matt Birkbeck, who wrote \\"A Deadly Secret: The Strange Disappearance of Kathie Durst.\\" “They brought up Durst.” Kathie Durst was the cross-dressing multimillionaire’s first wife, who vanished in 1982. Humboldt County District Attorney Maggie Fleming declined to discuss Durst or the Mitchell case. “I really can't confirm or deny that Durst is a person of interest because anything said about the investigation could potentially hinder the investigation,” she said. Gerald Herbert/AP Robert Durst is escorted into Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court in New Orleans on Tuesday. Modafferi’s dad said he hasn’t heard from the feds recently about his daughter, who was 18 when she vanished while visiting San Francisco. So he is reaching out to them. “The Durst news has created enough of a question mark in my mind that I'm going to follow up with the FBI,” Bob Modafferi said. “If he was in that area where Kirsten went missing, it raises a bunch of potential red flags and questions.” Mitchell, who vanished on Nov. 25, 1997, volunteered at a homeless shelter in Eureka, Calif., where Durst had been spotted, Birkbeck said. Police said that after leaving the shelter, Mitchell walked over to the Bayshore Mall and visited her aunt, Annie Casper, at her shoe store. Then Mitchell left for her aunt’s home — and has not been seen since. Durst lived in the nearby town of Trinidad at the time and visited Casper’s store — while dressed in drag — at least four times, Birkbeck said. Investigators also looked at Durst in connection with Modafferi, a college student from North Carolina who went missing on June 23, 1997, Birkbeck said. “The investigators told me that one of the suspects they were looking at had dressed in drag, he had some odd habits,” he said, referring to the Mitchell case. “After I finished the interview, I mentioned that I covered Robert Durst, who also dressed in drag. They wrote his name down and then I discovered he was living in San Francisco at the time. The police just jumped on it. They started putting pieces together.” Bob Modafferi, 66, of Charlotte, N.C. confirmed that cops went “down that road to see if there was anything to it.” “They did not indicate to us there’s anything there,” he said. “As time goes on, realistically the hope starts to dim, but it never dies out completely. There are cases you hear about that finally have a break. We will never lose faith or give up hope.” Durst’s lawyers have said they know nothing about Mitchell or Modafferi and deny he had anything to do with Berman’s murder or Kathie Durst’s disappearance. Durst was acquitted of killing neighbor Morris Black, even though he admitted chopping up his body. rblau@nydailynews.com ||||| HOUSTON (AP) — Authorities on Tuesday carried away two boxes after searching the Houston home of real estate millionaire Robert Durst after his weekend arrest in New Orleans on a murder warrant.

(Associated Press) Durst, 71, is charged with murder in a killing in California 15 years ago, and has been suspected — but never charged — in the disappearance of his first wife in New York. In 2003, he was acquitted of murder in a dismemberment death in Texas. His arrest in New Orleans came shortly before the finale of an HBO series about his links to the three killings. Seven officers spent hours Tuesday searching Durst's home in a 17-story condominium building in a posh Houston neighborhood. About 8:30 p.m. the officers, including one wearing a Los Angeles Police Department badge, carried two white cardboard document boxes to six vehicles and left. The officers declined to comment, except for one who confirmed they were done. FBI spokeswoman Shauna Dunlap confirmed that FBI agents participated in the operation at the request of the Los Angeles Police Department. Harris County district attorney's office spokesman Jeff McShan said the Los Angeles Police Department contacted his office last week. Neither Dunlap nor McShan would elaborate on what was happening inside the building and referred questions to Los Angeles police. LAPD spokesman Sgt. Barry Montgomery said the department is not commenting until Durst is in its custody. Durst is being held in Louisiana, where he faces drug and weapons charges, and it's not clear how soon he will be returned to California. \\"This is an investigation that's being handled by multi-jurisdictions,\\" Montgomery said. \\"At this juncture the only thing the LAPD is doing is waiting for the extradition. We are just waiting on him to make it into our custody.\\" Durst, 71, was charged Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Susan Berman, his confidante and the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster, in Beverly Hills. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. Dick DeGuerin, Durst's longtime Houston defense attorney, said he was baffled by what investigators could be looking for in the condo building. \\"I think it's a publicity stunt. I'm not surprised by it, but I would really be surprised if they found anything of any evidentiary value,\\" he said. In the documentary \\"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\\" that just wrapped up, Durst mumbled about how he \\"killed them all,\\" providing a dramatic kick to the end of the series. But a law enforcement official said his arrest on the murder charge was based on words he wrote. Analysis linked a letter Durst wrote to Berman a year before her killing with one that pointed police to her body, and that was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation into the 2000 killing, the official not authorized to speak publicly told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing. Bob Martin, who has lived with his wife, Carol, in the Houston building for 1 ½ years, said he would occasionally say hello to Durst and discuss the real estate market with him. He described Durst as no quirkier than anyone else in the building. He added that Durst would occasionally attend the building's homeowners' association meetings and that the building staff reported Durst was courteous to them, as well. Durst waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him with being a felon in possession of a gun and with having marijuana. Assistant District Mark Burton said investigators found more than a quarter-pound of pot and a revolver in his hotel room. DeGuerin said he wants a hearing in Louisiana as soon as possible to contest the arrest. \\"The warrant we believe is based on a television show and not on actual fact,\\" he said. \\"We want a hearing as quickly as possible so Mr. Durst can go to California and face trial as quickly as possible.\\" The judge in New Orleans scheduled another hearing for next Monday. ___ Associated Press writers Tami Abdollah and Brian Melley in Los Angeles, Janet McConnaughey in New Orleans and Emily Wagster in Jackson, Miss., contributed to this report. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Eureka Police Department Chief Andy Mills said Tuesday that he would like to talk to investigators who have dug into Durst’s past in connection with the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who was 16 when she went missing from Eureka, California, in 1997. \\"We believe she met foul play but we do not know that for sure,\\" Mills told NBC News, adding that they would like to learn more about when Durst was in Eureka.

You need to find every ith element of A starting from the kth element. The process stops when the position of the next ith element exceeds the length of the list. Q: 1, 2, ['7521', '3307', 'i', '2127', '1043'] A:","output":"Part #1: Given inputs k, i, and A Usage: k = 1, i = 2, A = ['7521', '3307', 'i', '2127', '1043']. The given inputs are k and i as integers, and A as a list of elements. Part #2: Find every ith element of A starting from the kth element Usage: Starting from k = 1 (where the element is '7521'), we find every ith (i = 2) element in the list A. The first ith element is '3307' (2nd element), and second ith element is '2127' (4th element). It meets the criteria because we are selecting every second element starting from the first element. Part #3: The process stops when the position of the next ith element exceeds the length of the list Usage: In our example, after selecting '2127' as the second ith element, the next ith element should be at position 6. However, the length of the list A is only 5 elements. Hence, the process stops as the position of the next element (6) exceeds the length of the list (5)."},{"instruction":"African football's ruling body, the Confederation of African Football, has called for a thorough investigation into how 15 fans died at a league match in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The fatalities occurred after a stampede broke out in the closing stages of Sunday's decisive meeting between the country's biggest clubs, AS Vita Club and TP Mazembe. Reports state that trouble flared after fans of home side Vita started throwing missiles onto the pitch with their team trailing 1-0 in a game where the victor would take the title. The police responded by firing tear gas whereupon a stampede for the exit gates led to chaotic scenes of overcrowding, resulting in the deaths and injuries to over 20 others. On its website, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) said the stampede 'caused the collapse of a wall and a gate of the Tata Raphael stadium'. The match was taking place in the Congolese capital Kinshasa, at the stadium that staged the legendary 'Rumble in the Jungle' boxing bout between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in 1974. \\"I wish to reemphasize that any acts of violence have no place in football,\\" CAF President Issa Hayatou told cafonline.com. \\"They must be condemned in the strongest possible terms and I urge FECOFA (the Congolese FA) and authorities in DR Congo to thoroughly investigate this matter and ensure that measures (are) put in place to avoid a repeat of any incidents.\\" The long-serving Cameroonian also demanded that CAF be kept abreast of any proposed security measures. Kinshasa governor Andre Kimbuta has already set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the disaster. \\"On behalf of FIFA and in my own name, I offer you, and the Congolese FA, my sincerest condolences,\\" wrote FIFA President Sepp Blatter in a letter to the President of FECOFA. \\"I would be most grateful if you would pass on the deep sympathy and support of the entire international football community to the families, loved ones and clubs of the deceased and victims at this very difficult time.\\" \\"May this message soften their pain and bring them support and comfort.\\" At FIFA's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich, the flags of both DR Congo and CAF were flown at half-mast in a sign of mourning. The disaster is the worst at a Congolese football match since a game in Butembo in 2008, when 13 spectators -- many of whom were children -- died after police fired tear gas into the crowd shortly after stones had been thrown by the fans. Six years on, a similar set of circumstances has sparked a further devastating loss of life. The two teams are set to meet again on the weekend of May 24-25 in the group stages of the African Champions League. CAF is considering whether to play the match between AS Vita, crowned African champions in the 1970s, and four-time continental winners Mazembe behind closed doors. Mazembe stunned the footballing world in 2010 when becoming the first African side to reach the final of FIFA's Club World Cup, but their name may now conjure up far sadder emotions.

The author does not directly claim that the government is \\"messy\\"; however, they imply that the government has been somewhat negligent or inattentive in this area.

The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website. However, the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons: a) Moore clearly states that \\"before he came to Flint\\", Heston gave an interview. In the excerpt from said interview, we can see that it is from March. If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers, why would he say this, and show the month the interview was published? b) Why should Moore leave the words \\"Clinton is on the Today Show\\" visible in the text, which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part? I reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing. c) Both the \\"soccer mom\\" interview and the sequences showing the NRA rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally happened months after the fact. The camera lingers on Bush/Cheney posters, and the protestor is quoted as saying that \\"we wanted to let the NRA know that we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland\\". You make the hysterical claim that the interview \\"may be faked\\" (on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee), but if Moore had faked it, why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestor's mouth, which directly contradicts the conclusion that the rally happened hours after Kayla's death? Why did Moore, the masterful deveiver, not edit this sequence out? This makes no sense. Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nation's youngest school shooting months after the fact, but this sequence of \\"Bowling\\" is without doubt the most unfair to Heston. The claims of deliberate distortion don't hold up when viewing the whole scene, though -- as \\"Hanlon's Razor\\" states, one should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence. The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions, which is unfortunate, but Moore's critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly. Had they done so, Moore himself would probably have apologized for the gaffe. In any case, at no point does Moore make a false statement, in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is \\"full of lies\\". After reading the above, is \\"Before he came to Flint\\" the correct answer to the question \\"When did Heston give an interview?\\"?","output":"Yes, \\"before he came to Flint\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"When did Heston give an interview?\\" as per the information provided in the text.

Adam Farooqui holds a sign as he stands at Zuccotti Park on Wednesday in New York. \\"We need to have a symbolic presence,\\" said Ned Merrill, 52, a blanket draped over his shoulder. He spoke as workers for Brookfield Office Properties, which owns the plaza, maneuvered around the scattered protesters with steam cleaners. The barricades that came down Tuesday were chained together and neatly stacked at the north end of the park. On Tuesday, about 300 protesters filled Zuccotti after the barricades were taken down. Police spokesman Paul Browne said the New York Police Department and Brookfield had been talking about removing the barriers last week. The decision was made to remove them Tuesday because officials felt they were no longer necessary, Browne said. Merrill said it's important for at least a few protesters to be at Zuccotti at all times. He said he's been there from midnight to about 10 a.m. most nights since Dec. 1. \\"Most people in American know that something is wrong,\\" he said. \\"Much of what is wrong is that money owns the political process.\\" Robert Segal, who is 47 and works in a wine store, also spent Tuesday night at Zuccotti. \\"The rest of the world want a place where they can come down and join Occupy Wall Street at critical moments,\\" he said. Tents and sleeping bags have been banned from Zuccotti Park since a Nov. 15 police raid evicted protesters who had been sleeping there since Sept. 17. Merrill said security guards have prevented him from sitting on a piece of plastic foam when he spends the night there. They told him it was considered bedding, he said. On Monday, civil rights groups filed a complaint with the city's buildings department saying the barricades were a violation of city zoning law.

In this final stage, adult butterflies focus on finding a mate and reproducing. Mating in butterflies usually occurs through a courtship process, which can involve visual, tactile, or chemical cues. Some butterflies engage in elaborate courtship flights to attract a mate, while others may release pheromones or use bright colors or patterns on their wings. Once a suitable partner has been identified and the courtship is successful, the butterflies will mate. Following mating, the female butterfly searches for a suitable host plant to lay her eggs. The choice of plant is crucial, as it serves as a food source for the emerging caterpillars. Female butterflies have evolved to be highly selective in choosing host plants, as some plants produce toxins that can harm the caterpillars. In some cases, the female butterfly may even taste potential host plants using sensory organs on her legs, called chemoreceptors, to ensure that the plant is suitable. Once the female butterfly finds the appropriate host plant, she will lay her eggs, typically on the underside of the leaves to provide shelter and camouflage. The number of eggs varies depending on the species, but could range from a few dozen to several hundred. The eggs are secured using a sticky substance produced by the butterfly, which hardens quickly to firmly attach the eggs to the plant. In conclusion, the final step in the process of a butterfly's life cycle is reproductive and involves finding a mate, mating, and laying eggs on a suitable host plant. This ensures the continuation of the species and starts the life cycle all over again with a new generation of butterflies going through the stages of egg, larva, pupa, and adult butterfly."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Edward was a?\\" is in \\"Court presentations of aristocratic young ladies to the monarch took place at the palace from the reign of Edward VII.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Step 1: Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt into a bowl Justification: This step combines the dry ingredients that will provide the structure and leavening capabilities to the batter. Flour provides gluten which forms the structure, baking powder acts as a leavening agent, sugar provides sweetness to the batter and also softens it, and salt enhances the overall flavor of the pancakes. Step 2: Mix in milk, eggs, and melted butter Justification: This step incorporates the wet ingredients necessary for the batter's consistency, structure, and flavor. Milk adds moisture, eggs give structure and richness, and melted butter provides a tender texture and added flavor. Step 3: Mix until smooth Justification: This step ensures that the wet and dry ingredients are combined well without overmixing, which could result in a tough pancake due to the development of too much gluten. The batter should be smooth to create uniform and tender pancakes. Step 4: Heat a griddle or frying pan to medium high Justification: This step ensures the cooking surface has reached an optimal temperature for evenly browning the pancakes and allowing them to rise properly. If the griddle is too hot, the pancakes will burn before they're cooked through; if it's too cool, they won't rise or brown properly. Step 5: Pour batter onto the griddle Justification: This step distributes the batter onto the cooking surface in portions to form individual pancakes that will cook evenly. Perturbation Hypothesis: If there is more sugar available, there will be more mixture. The additional sugar would increase the volume of the mixture. This may result in sweeter and softer pancakes but could also negatively affect their structure, browning, and rise if the sugar content is increased too much. Effect of the Perturbation: Increased sugar content will have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Directly, it will affect the sweetness and texture of the batter and pancakes. Indirectly, it could impact the structure, browning, and rise of the pancakes during cooking, potentially leading to undesired results or alterations in the final appearance and texture. In either case, it will change the final outcome of the pancakes and may require adjustments to the cooking process to accommodate the additional sugar."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Bristol, the largest city in South West England, has an eclectic combination of architectural styles, ranging from the medieval to 20th century brutalism and beyond. During the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an architectural style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most of the architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church. The construction of the city's Floating Harbour, taking in the wharves on the River Avon and Frome, provided a focus for industrial development and the growth of the local transport infrastructure. Key elements of which include the Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed Clifton Suspension Bridge and Temple Meads terminus; the latter served from 2002 to 2009 as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, but is now closed.The 20th century saw further expansion of the city, the growth of the University of Bristol and the arrival of the aircraft industry.

What should catfish smell like?","output":"No, the following two questions are not the same, but they seek similar information regarding the olfactory characteristics of two different types of fish: wild salmon and catfish. Both questions essentially ask how each type of fish should smell in order to assess its freshness and quality. I will provide a detailed analysis and comparison of the smells associated with fresh wild salmon and catfish below. 1. What should wild salmon smell like? Wild salmon, when fresh, should have a mild, pleasant scent indicative of the ocean or fresh water, depending on where it came from. Some people describe the smell of fresh salmon as slightly briny, like seawater, or reminiscent of a fresh, clean, and chilly river. It should not have an overpowering or \\"fishy\\" smell, which can be an indication of spoilage or poor quality. The flesh of the salmon should also appear firm and somewhat moist to the touch. Another indicator of freshness is the presence of a slimy layer on the skin; however, this slime should be clear and not cloudy or discolored. 2. What should catfish smell like? Fresh catfish, like wild salmon, should also have a mild and subtle aroma. A properly cleaned and prepared catfish should smell a bit earthy, but not muddy or musty, as catfish are bottom-dwelling fish that often reside and feed in muddy environments. Their muscles can retain some of these flavors and smells, but careful handling and cleaning can reduce these unwanted characteristics. Fresh catfish should not have a strong or \\"fishy\\" odor, and, again, such a smell can be a sign of spoilage or poor quality. The flesh should appear firm, moist, and white, sometimes with a pinkish or iridescent hue. In summary, while the two questions are not identical, they both pertain to the freshness and quality of two different types of fish: wild salmon and catfish. Both fish should have a subtle, mild aroma that is reflective of their natural environments. Strong or \\"fishy\\" smells should raise suspicions about the freshness and quality of the product."},{"instruction":"Review: The fully rounded character of the principal role of this movie, that of the cop torn up by his past and on a path of self-destruction so clear to the viewer, is unique for its time, 1950.

Close-ups of Dana's eyes reveal the anguish within, Karl Malden excels as his boss, who brooks no nonsense but also has compassion for those under his command in the precinct.

Choices: - sweat - dribbling - hurt yourself - fall down - make baskets The rationale to choose \\"fall down\\" as the answer is that:","output":"When playing basketball, tripping can lead to various outcomes, depending on the severity and context. However, among the given choices, \\"fall down\\" is the most appropriate answer as it is the most direct consequence of tripping while playing basketball. Here is the rationale for choosing \\"fall down\\": 1. Sweat: Sweating is a natural bodily function that occurs in any physical activity, not just in basketball or as a result of tripping. It is the body's way to cool itself down during exercise. Sweating is not directly related to tripping as it can happen even while playing without falling. 2. Dribbling: Dribbling is an essential basketball skill where the player bounces the ball continuously on the court. It is a technique used to move with the ball, making it difficult for the opposition to steal it. While tripping might be caused by a failed attempt at dribbling or intercepting the ball, it is not a consequence of tripping. 3. Hurt yourself: While it's true that you can potentially hurt yourself when tripping during basketball, injuries can result from various actions and incidents. Not every trip necessarily leads to hurting yourself, as sometimes players may fall in a way that avoids injury. 4. Fall down: Tripping in basketball is most likely to result in falling down on the court. Losing balance or stumbling due to contact with another player or misstep can cause a player to fall. Falling down is the most direct consequence of tripping, making it the best answer among the choices given. 5. Make baskets: Making baskets is scoring points by shooting the ball into the opponents' hoop. Tripping, on the other hand, is an undesirable event that hinders a player's performance on the court and is not related to making baskets. In summary, among the options provided, \\"fall down\\" is the most suitable answer as it is the most immediate result of tripping while playing basketball. Furthermore, falling down could lead to potential injuries, but not every fall results in hurt. Other outcomes, such as sweating, dribbling, and making baskets, are not directly related to tripping incidents during the game."},{"instruction":"Please briefly summarize this news article: Fans congratulate Danniella Westbrook on ‘pregnancy’ after sharing THIS snap - but is she expecting? The actress joked about having a baby bump as she lounged in the pool DANNIELLA Westbrook admitted she was “looking very pregnant” in her recent holiday snap – after making no secret about wanting a baby with toyboy lover George Arnold. In a snap which showed the bikini-clad ex EastEnders star lounging out on an inflatable flamingo, she wrote: “So chilled out. Looking very pregnant,” followed by cheeky monkey and love heart Emoji icons. The actress showed off her tanned tummy in the sun-soaked snap as she relaxed in matching swimwear. Yet her pool antics in Portugal came second to her comment as fans flocked to respond to her cheeky suggestion she could be expecting. One was quick to celebrate and wrote: “Congratulations beautiful!!” while one simply put: “Congrats xx.” Another added: “You don’t look pregnant but if you are congrats hun, deserve it all.” Many others quizzed as to whether her words were just meant as tongue-in-cheek and uploaded the question: “Are you pregnant?” One took her comments as pure banter and added: “I think she’s probably just tormenting everyone little moo.” She later uploaded another shot showing her sliding into the water and sporting a headscarf to protect her blonde locks from the water. Yet the star of the small screen, who looked blissfully happy as she topped up her tan on the inflatable, could just as well have been channelling the mood of fellow actress Jennifer Aniston. The Friends star this week spoke out to set the record straight about “absurd” pregnancy rumours. She has insisted she is not expecting a child with husband Justin Theroux and urged fans to stop speculating about her baby status every time she has a “burger for lunch”. They came just hours before Danniella, already a mum-of-two, posted a super-cute snap of her date night with George. The Celebrity Big Brother star showed off her toned legs in a thigh-skimming denim dress which she paired with strappy black sandals and a hat. Danniella, 42, stood sandwiched next to George, 24, as they posed with a huge yacht in the background. She captioned the sweet snap: “Dinner with the one I love,” and hashtags including #mylove #mygeorge. Earlier this year, she revealed she was trying for a baby with George and would even fork out for costly IVF treatment if she struggled to conceive naturally. She told Closer magazine: “I’d love to be a mum again. I feel like this could be my happy ending. “George and I have just bought a house together and I’m excited to get married to him this year. “We’re also going to start trying for a baby, and if it doesn’t work within two months, I’ll have IVF.” She added: “The past two years have been awful but I’ve softened now and let my guard down because I’ve met George. Since I met him I’ve had a smile on my face every day and we would love to get married, so once my divorce has gone through, we’ll do that.” Meanwhile a spokesperson for Danniella denied she was pregnant.

Creativity is an essential skill that plays a vital role in all aspects of life, including academic performance, problem-solving, and emotional well-being. Several factors have been identified as having an impact on children's creativity, such as family environment, cultural backgrounds, educational institutions, and leisure activities. Furthermore, the availability of adequate resources, technology, and exposure to arts and sciences are factors believed to directly impact children's creative potential. One influential aspect that has not been extensively studied is the impact of time spent outdoors in natural environments on the development of creativity in children. With the growing prevalence of technology and structured indoor activities, it has become more important than ever to understand if time spent in nature can positively affect the process of creative development and cognitive flexibility in children. Hypothesis: Spending more time in natural environments has a positive effect on the development of creativity in children, as outdoor activities and exposure to nature provide enhanced cognitive stimulation, boost the ability to think divergently, and foster emotional well-being, ultimately leading to an increased creative potential. To test this hypothesis, researchers would need to design a study examining the relationship between time spent in natural environments and the development of children's creativity. Participants would be recruited from various ages and cultural backgrounds, and assessments would be made based on their exposure to natural environments and their performance on standardized creativity measurement tools. Comparisons could be drawn between children who frequently engage with nature and children with minimal exposure. The results of such a study would not only shed light on the impact of natural environments on creativity but could also guide future educational and parenting strategies to nurture the creative potentials of their children."},{"instruction":"Imagine a question and stream-of-consciousness explanation for which this is the answer: 55","output":"Question: How many days in total would it take to watch every episode from seasons 1-10 of Friends, if you were watching 10 episodes a day? Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Friends is a popular television show that aired from 1994 to 2004, spanning 10 seasons and having a total of 236 episodes. It is well-known for its great humor, memorable catchphrases, and iconic storylines. The show's length and popularity make it a common choice for binge-watching. If someone were to try to watch every episode of Friends from seasons 1 to 10, we would first need to figure out how many episodes there are in total. As mentioned, there are 236 episodes across all 10 seasons. Now, let's say this person has enough time each day to watch 10 episodes. We would then need to calculate how many days, in total, it would take them to watch all 236 episodes while maintaining this pace. To find this out, we can divide the total number of episodes (236) by the number of episodes watched per day (10): 236 ÷ 10 = 23.6 Since it's not possible to watch 0.6 of an episode, we'll round up the result to 24. So, it would take this person 24 full days of watching 10 episodes per day to finish all 236 episodes. However, on the 24th day, they would only need to watch 6 episodes to complete the series, having watched 230 episodes in the previous 23 days (23 days x 10 episodes/day = 230 episodes). So, in conclusion, it would take someone 55 episodes to reach their 5th day of watching 10 episodes of Friends per day, and they would still have 181 episodes left to watch during the following 19 days."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key.

By the time Doc returns, Rio has fallen in love with her patient. Doc is furious that Billy has stolen his girlfriend. After Doc's anger subsides a bit, the Kid gives him a choice: the horse or Rio. To Billy's annoyance, Doc picks the horse. Angered that both men value the animal more than her, Rio fills their canteens with sand. The two ride off without noticing. On the trail, they find themselves being pursued by Pat and a posse. The pair surmise that Rio tipped the sheriff off. Doc kills a few men from long range, but leaves Pat unharmed. When Doc wakes up one morning, he finds Billy gone and Pat waiting to handcuff him and take him back.

Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a \\"specific\\" individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes called \\"common names\\" or (obsolete) \\"general names\\". A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name. - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - A monarch is the sovereign head of state in a monarchy. A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the state, or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Typically a monarch either personally inherits the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as \\"the throne\\" or \\"the crown\\") or is selected by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, acclamation or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns for life or until abdication. - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \\"regnal\\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \\"name\\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously. For example, the same person was both King James I of England (along with Ireland) and King James VI of Scotland. - Dead Run is the third book by mother and daughter authors P. J. Tracy. It follows on from their first and second books, \\"Want to Play?\\" and \\"Live Bait\\" and has the same principal characters. - In modern popular fiction, a superhero (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of costumed heroic character who possesses supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains. A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine). Fiction centered on such characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s, is known as superhero fiction. - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge. - A stage name, also called a screen name, is a pseudonym used by performers and entertainers such as actors, comedians, and musicians. - Monkeewrench (released later in the United Kingdom as \\"Want to Play?\\"), is the first novel by author team P. J. Tracy. It revolves around the search for a copycat killer, who is recreating murders found in a new computer game. It also seems that the killer is linked to the computer programmers who made the game. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - An anagram is direct word switch or word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example, the word anagram can be rearranged into nag-a-ram. Someone who creates anagrams may be called an \\"anagrammatist\\". The original word or phrase is known as the \\"subject\\" of the anagram. Anagrams are often used as a form of mnemonic device as well. - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\". - A ring name is a stage name used by a professional wrestler, martial artist, or a boxer. While some ring names may have a fictitious first name and surname, others may simply be a nickname from the moves that they do or their talents in the ring. - P. J. Tracy is a pseudonym for American mother - daughter writing team Patricia ( P. J. ) and Traci Lambrecht .

O positive blood","output":"Title: Blood Moon Sonata Genre: Thriller/Horror Plot: Intro: On the eve of the Blood Moon, a mysterious drink called \\"O positive blood\\" is said to grant supernatural abilities to whoever consumes it under the lunar light. Terrori, a charismatic and mischievous bar owner, holds a secret annual event in the otherwise quiet town of Elswood. Act 1: Pepito, a washed-up musician in his 40s, enters Terrori's Bar in search of the legendary \\"O positive blood\\" drink said to change a person's destiny forever. Grappling with both creative block and financial struggles, Pepito desperately hopes the drink will reignite his musical career and mend his broken family. Act 2: As the night unfolds, various patrons notice chattering about the legendary Blood Moon, but nobody seems to know if Terrori will actually serve the curious concoction at his bar. Suspense builds among the customers as the moon proceeds to change color. Midpoint: Terrori and Pepito cross paths when the drink-laden bar owner remarks on Pepito's vast knowledge of classic music. Together, they share a few drinks and Terrori reveals the truth behind the O positive blood drink. Skepticism is replaced by morbid fascination as Pepito listens closely to Terrori's tale. With thirty minutes remaining until the Blood Moon, Terrori offers Pepito the mystical drink with a cryptic warning. Act 3: Driven by ambition, Pepito consumes the O positive blood under the Blood Moon's eerie light. The effects are instantaneous –enhancing his senses, movement, and cello playing ability to supernatural levels. Unfortunately, as Pepito leaves the bar, Terrori's warning begins to make sense: his newfound talents have come with an ominous curse. Act 4: The whole town of Elswood falls under a mind-altering spell as Pepito performs. Mesmerized by his music, people are irresistibly drawn to him, leading to chaos and destruction. As time passes, Pepito becomes physically and emotionally drained, losing sight of his values and those who truly love him. Climax: Witnessing the devastation caused by his enchanting performance, Pepito realizes how blinded he's been by his desire for fame and success. His wife, Maria, pleads with Pepito to put an end to the curse. Determined to make things right, Pepito must team up with Terrori and face a sinister force – The Blood Moon Deity – to break the spell that has engulfed Elswood. Conclusion: In an emotional and suspense-filled finale, Pepito defeats the Blood Moon Deity, freeing the town from the curse and renouncing his supernatural abilities. Though his path to redemption is difficult, he learns the importance of true connections and love. By their side, Terrori helps to rebuild his bar and the town, continuing to host his enigmatic events but without the devastating consequences."},{"instruction":"Robert, a baker, has just baked a large batch of cupcakes for his store.

He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer. Which temperature will result in slower growth of micro-organisms on the cupcakes?","output":"Storing the cupcakes at the lower temperature of 0° F will result in slower growth of micro-organisms compared to storing them at 10° F. The growth rate of micro-organisms, including bacteria and molds, decreases as the temperature gets colder. Consequently, the cupcakes will be better preserved at a lower temperature, such as 0° F. In the freezing environment, the water content within the food will turn into ice, making it unavailable for microbial growth. It's essential to mention that freezing doesn't completely kill all micro-organisms, but it significantly decreases their metabolic activities and growth rate, which helps in preserving the food quality. It's also important to store the cupcakes in airtight packaging or containers before placing them in the freezer to prevent freezer burn, maintain their moisture content, and reduce the risk of any cross-contamination from other items in the freezer."},{"instruction":"Question: Robert A.

Lab tests have confirmed that a virulent strain of hand, foot and mouth disease known as EV-71 is to blame for some of the 59 cases reviewed, including 52 deaths, according to a joint statement from the World Health Organization and Cambodian Health Ministry. The numbers were lowered from the initial report of 62 cases. EV-71 is a virus that can result in paralysis, brain swelling and death. Most of the Cambodian cases involved children younger than 3 who experienced fever, respiratory problems that quickly progressed and sometimes neurological symptoms. Epidemiologists are still trying to piece together information about the cases by interviewing parents because some details were omitted or missing from medical charts and specimens were not taken from most children before they died, said Dr. Nima Asgari, who is leading the investigation at WHO. Of 24 samples tested, 15 came back positive for EV-71. (PHOTOS: Displaced: The Cambodian Diaspora) “As far as I’m aware, EV-71 was not identified as a virus in Cambodia before,” Asgari said, adding that based on the information now available it’s likely that the majority of patients were infected with it. “We are a bit more confident. We are hoping that we can come up with something a bit more conclusive in the next day or so,” he said. Hand, foot and mouth disease has been raging across Asia and usually causes a telltale rash. Rashes were only reported in some of the Cambodian cases, and it’s possible that steroids administered by doctors could have masked that symptom or that it wasn’t recorded, he said. The lab results also identified other diseases in some cases, including mosquito-borne dengue fever and Streptococcus suis, a germ commonly seen in pigs that sometimes infects people, often causing meningitis and hearing loss. Hand, foot and mouth disease is spread by sneezing, coughing and contact with fluid from blisters or infected feces. It is caused by a group of enteroviruses in the same family as polio. No vaccine or specific treatment exists, but illness is typically mild and most children recover quickly without problems. The virus gets its name from the symptoms it causes, including rash, mouth sores and blisters covering the hands and feet. Many infected children don’t get sick but can spread it to others. Neighboring Vietnam has been battling a surging number of hand, foot and mouth disease cases for the past few years, with EV-71 also wreaking havoc there. Last year, the disease sickened more than 110,000 people in Vietnam and killed 166, mostly children whose immune systems were not strong enough to fend off the infection. China is also experiencing an outbreak, and more than 240 people have died of the disease there this year, according to China’s health ministry. The Cambodia investigation is continuing, but the H5N1 bird flu virus, SARS and Nipah — a deadly virus usually spread by fruit bats or pigs _ have all been ruled out.

The PRC's UN Ambassador, Wang Yingfan , has stated multiple times in the UN general committee: \\"Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory since antiquity\\" and \\"both the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Declaration have reaffirmed in unequivocal terms China's sovereignty over Taiwan as a matter of international law.\\" The PRC rejects arguments involving the lack of a specific treaty transferring Taiwan's sovereignty to China by noting that neither PRC nor ROC was a signatory to any such treaty, making the treaties irrelevant with regard to Chinese claims. The ROC argues that the Treaty of Taipei implicitly transferred sovereignty of Taiwan to it, however the US State Dept. disagreed with such an interpretation in its 1971 Starr Memorandum What event happened first, Cairo Declaration or Potsdam Declaration?","output":"The Cairo Declaration happened first. It took place in 1943 during the Cairo Conference, where the allied powers, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of China, convened to discuss their strategy against Japan during World War II. The Potsdam Declaration followed two years later, in 1945, when the Allied leaders gathered once again, this time including the Soviet Union, to demand Japan's unconditional surrender and outline the terms of its post-war status. Both declarations addressed the restoration of territories that Japan had taken from China, including Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu."},{"instruction":"Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what converts chemical energy to mechanical energy when it moves?\\" is \\"bears\\", given that when a cow moves, chemical energy is converted to mechanical energy? OPTIONS: [-] Yes. [-] No. Answer:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what converts chemical energy to mechanical energy when it moves?\\" is not \\"bears.\\" Although bears and cows are both examples of animals that convert chemical energy into mechanical energy during movement, they are specific instances rather than a general answer that encompasses the broader concept being investigated. The true answer is rooted in the cellular and molecular processes that facilitate this energy conversion. When any living organism moves, including bears and cows, their cells convert chemical energy stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into mechanical energy through a process known as cellular respiration. This conversion occurs primarily through the action of cellular components known as mitochondria, which function as the powerplants of the cell by breaking down nutrients within cells and releasing energy to power various processes, including movement. One of the well-known proteins involved in this process of converting chemical energy stored in ATP into mechanical energy is myosin. Myosin is a motor protein found inside muscle cells that interacts with another protein called actin in a sliding filament mechanism. This interaction causes the contraction of muscles and, ultimately, the movement of the organism. In conclusion, instead of \\"bears\\" or any other specific animal, the right answer to the question should refer to the cellular components and molecular processes that enable the conversion of chemical energy to mechanical energy during movement. These include the actions of mitochondria, ATP, myosin, and actin, which collectively facilitate this conversion in animals such as bears and cows but also in other living organisms that possess muscles for movement."},{"instruction":"Do you like to play games?

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"As an AI, I don't have personal emotions or preferences, so I don't \\"like\\" anything or play games myself. However, I can provide information on games and am proficient in understanding and answering questions about a variety of gaming topics. Some popular games include board games like chess and monopoly, video games like Fortnite and Minecraft, and casual mobile games like Candy Crush Saga and Pokémon GO. Programmers, like any other people, can have various hobbies and interests, including playing games. However, it is important to emphasize that not all programmers play games, but many do, especially since their profession may have a natural connection to the creation and development of gaming technologies. Some programmers may be drawn to games that challenge their problem-solving skills, like puzzle games, strategy games, or competitive games that require teamwork. On the other hand, they may also choose to use games as a way to decompress and relax, turning to casual titles. The two initial questions in your message appear to address different topics. The first question asks about my personal preferences regarding games and which ones I might enjoy, while the second question focuses on whether or not programmers enjoy gaming in general and which games they might play. Thus, these questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they each address distinct aspects of gaming.

For example, each O-H bond in water is an example of a dipole; the partial positive charge on hydrogen is separated from the partial negative charge on oxygen by the length of the bond. A molecular dipole is the geometric sum of all the individual bond dipoles in a molecule. In order for a molecule to have a dipole, it must have at least one polar bond.

John Jones, 26, of Stansbury Park died about 12:30 a.m., nearly 28 hours after became stuck 700 feet into the cave known as Nutty Putty, 80 miles from Salt Lake City, Utah County Sheriff's Department spokesman Sgt. Spencer Cannon said. Rescuers were next to Jones for much of the day but he was wedged in a small hole too tightly to pull him out or even reach through to assist him, Cannon told The Associated Press. \\"Over the past several hours he was experiencing difficulty maintaining consciousness and breathing. With whatever other factors there were, he did not survive,\\" Cannon said. Jones got stuck in a hole about 18 inches wide and 10 inches high with his head below his feet about 9 p.m. MST Tuesday. At times up to 50 rescuers were involved in trying to free him. The crevice where Jones was trapped was about 150 feet below ground in an L-shaped area of the cave known as \\"Bob's Push,\\" which is only about 18 inches wide and 10 inches high, Cannon said. The process was slow throughout the day Wednesday with rescuers chipping away with air-powered tools in the arrow tunnel. At one point late in the afternoon, Jones was freed from the crevice, only to fall back several feet into the tight space when a cord that was supporting him failed, Cannon said Rescuers were able to get him food and water during that temporary freedom. Cannon said Jones was about six feet tall and weighs between 180 and 200 pounds. Niki Yeaton, clinical nurse coordinator for University Hospital's emergency department, said earlier that anyone who has been upside down as long as Jones could suffer from a rush of blood to the head that leads to confusion and nausea. Nutty Putty cave is actually a hole on the top of hill about seven miles west of State Road 68. The naturally formed thermal cave is about 1,500 feet long. Its multiple, tunnels and passageways lead to room-like openings, a Web site for Utah cave-enthusiasts explains. According to the official Nutty Putty cave Web site, the area was first discovered in 1960. The cave is privately owned by Utah's State Institutional Trust Land Administration. An access pass is required to explore the cave, with usage restricted to about six groups daily. The county's last rescue there was in 2004. Cannon said officials considered closing the tunnel or sealing it off after the last rescue but ultimately decided to erect a gate that requires a key for entry. \\"We've had people stuck in this exact same spot. We're working and working to get him undone out of the spot and we don't really have any way of predicting what's gonna happen until _ boom, all the sudden they're out,\\" he said. ||||| Man trapped in Utah County's Nutty Putty cave dies ELBERTA, Utah County — Despite more than a full day of rescue efforts, John Edward Jones died around midnight Wednesday while trapped in a tight section of Nutty Putty Cave. He leaves behind a wife and a baby daughter, and a second child expected in June. According to a family statement released Thursday, Jones will be remembered for \\"his good nature, delightful sense of humor, strong work ethic, a genuine love of people, a masterful ability to relate to children, a love of and unwavering faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and his commitment to his family as an amazing husband, father, son and brother.\\" The family – including Jones' wife and daughter, parents, four brothers, two sisters and 16 nieces and nephews – said in the statement that they are grateful for the rescue efforts and know officials \\"did all they could to get John out,\\" including singing Primary songs to help get him through the night. \\"We'll never fully understand how or why it was John's time to leave us. But we find comfort knowing that he fulfilled his purpose here on Earth, and that we will be reunited with him again,\\" the family stated, adding thanks to many people and agencies that have helped them and Jones. \\"Thank you, and God bless all of you on this Thanksgiving Day.\\" Story continues below Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Eldon Packer said Jones, 26, became unresponsive before midnight and had difficulty breathing several hours before. Shortly after midnight a rescuer was able to get close enough to confirm the Stansbury Park man had died. \\"The emotional factor alone will have a toll on the rescuers,\\" Sgt. Spencer Cannon said. \\"We weren't able to get him out quick enough.\\" The recovery effort was shut down for the night. Sheriff's deputies returned to the site Thursday morning. Once a plan has been determined, Cannon said the rescuers will arrive and continue doing the same work they did in the 27 hours leading up to Jones' death as his body is still stuck in the same crevice. \\"We're still in the uncertainty phase in terms of how they're going to bring Jones out,\\" Cannon said Thursday. \\"We're back to where we were (during the) 27 hours, and once we get him unstuck it's still a two or three hour process of getting him back up.\\" In the meantime, sheriff's officials have declared the cave a public hazard. They've closed all access to the area and it will be guarded by uniformed deputies. Cannon said they are considering closing the cave permanently but have not made a concrete decision. The death of Jones, the first in the cave to date, prompted officials to reevaluate the monitoring of the cave since it became a controlled access point in 2004. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"John Jones, a 26-year-old man from Stansbury Park, was trapped upside down in Nutty Putty Cave, 80 miles from Salt Lake City, Utah and died after nearly 28 hours of rescue efforts.

Input: Passage: All Latin characters required by Pe̍h-ōe-jī can be represented using Unicode (or the corresponding ISO/IEC 10646: Universal Character Set), using precomposed or combining (diacritics) characters. Prior to June 2004, the vowel akin to but more open than o, written with a dot above right, was not encoded. The usual workaround was to use the (stand-alone; spacing) character Interpunct (U+00B7, ·) or less commonly the combining character dot above (U+0307). As these are far from ideal, since 1997 proposals have been submitted to the ISO/IEC working group in charge of ISO/IEC 10646—namely, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2—to encode a new combining character dot above right. This is now officially assigned to U+0358 (see documents N1593, N2507, N2628, N2699, and N2713). Font support is expected to follow.

Usage: What is the percentage of documents written in Pe̍h-ōe-jī that use the combining character dot above right (U+0358) instead of interpunct (U+00B7)? This question meets the criteria because the passage does not provide any information about the percentage of documents using the different characters, thus making it unanswerable. Part #2: Create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer. Usage: Who are the key contributors to the development of the Pe̍h-ōe-jī writing system? This question is unanswerable from the given passage because there is no mention of the individuals who contributed to the development of the writing system.

To attach two sticks together,","output":"To attach two sticks together, you can follow these easy steps: 1. Find two sticks: Look around and pick two sticks that you want to join. 2. Choose a connector: To hold the sticks together, you need something like a string, tape, glue, or a rubber band. 3. Tie or wrap the connector: If you choose a string or a rubber band, wrap it around the area where the sticks touch each other and make a tight knot. If you choose tape, place a piece of tape around the sticks so they stick together. If you choose glue, put some glue where the sticks touch, then hold them together until the glue dries. 4. Check your work: After you're done, test the connection by gently pulling the sticks apart. If they don't come apart, you did a great job!

Options: - yes - no Your chain-of-thought:","output":"The claim that \\"Einstein field equations allow the U.S. government to build faster than light secret space craft\\" is incorrect. Chain-of-thought: 1. Albert Einstein's field equations are a part of his theory of General Relativity, which is a well-established scientific theory describing gravitational forces in the universe. 2. The theory of General Relativity, however, does not allow for faster-than-light (FTL) travel, as it adheres to the universal speed limit imposed by Einstein's Special Relativity: the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 300,000 kilometers per second or 186,000 miles per second). 3. Due to this imposed limit, no known scientific theory, including Einstein's field equations, can currently be applied to create a faster-than-light space craft. 4. The U.S. government, or any other entity, is bound by the same laws of physics and has not demonstrated the ability to overcome these fundamental limitations.

Given the sentence \\"A woman poses next to a spinning wheel.\\" is it true that \\"A woman looks out the window as her car drives past a spinning wheel.\\"?. Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Step 1: Identify the statements to compare. Statement 1: \\"A woman poses next to a spinning wheel.\\" Statement 2: \\"A woman looks out the window as her car drives past a spinning wheel.\\" Step 2: Analyze the elements of each statement. Statement 1: - A woman is present - She is posing (a deliberate action or position) - A spinning wheel is present - The woman is next to the spinning wheel Statement 2: - A woman is present - She is looking out the window - She is in a car - The car is driving past a spinning wheel Step 3: Compare the elements of the two statements to determine their compatibility. A common element: There is a woman in both statements, and a spinning wheel is present. Differences: - In Statement 1, the woman is posing (deliberate action or position), while in Statement 2, she is looking out the window. - Statement 1 does not mention a car, while Statement 2 explicitly states that the woman is inside a car. - In Statement 1, the woman is next to the spinning wheel, while in Statement 2, the car is driving past the spinning wheel, implying the woman is not next to it. Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison. Since there are significant differences between the two statements, it cannot be concluded that Statement 2 is true given Statement 1. While both statements involve a woman and a spinning wheel, the context and actions of the woman are different in each statement."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a dialog between 2 or more individuals.

Monica's shared experiences and valuable insights on life after divorce could offer Patricia the much-needed emotional support and practical advice to help her cope with the rainy days ahead. As Patricia embarked on this challenging journey, she sought solace and guidance from someone who could relate to the daunting emotions that filled her with insecurity, fear, and sadness. Monica, having gone through the tumultuous rollercoaster of divorce herself, was well-equipped to offer both the emotional and psychological support that Patricia craved. Deeply rooted in the interconnectedness of their friendship, Monica had the ability to shed light on the darkest aspects of separation while helping Patricia understand that it is possible for the clouds to clear and hope to return. Monica's words of wisdom, stemming from her own personal experiences, would be an invaluable resource for Patricia to lean on. By sharing her own journey of rediscovering herself after the end of her marriage, Monica could aid Patricia in understanding the plethora of emotions that might surface as she came to terms with the reality of her broken relationship. Listening to Monica's story of growth and self-renewal would help inspire Patricia to start healing and rebuilding her own life after the divorce. Moreover, discussing the legal aspects and processes associated with divorce could help ease Patricia's anxiety about the uncertain times ahead. Monica's familiarity with these intricate procedures would be a tremendous help in guiding Patricia through her own divorce proceedings, alleviating some of the stress and confusion that commonly accompanies such an ordeal. On a practical level, Monica can offer Patricia advice on how to regain her emotional stability, create a strong support network, and develop coping mechanisms that can help her better manage her stress and anxiety. Over a few cups of tea, they could discuss important aspects such as breaking the news to their children or extended families, dealing with custody and co-parenting, managing personal finances, and seeking professional guidance such as therapy. Patricia's bond with Monica would not only provide her with the comfort of someone who has walked the same path but would also lend her the strength to face the uncertainties of the days ahead. With Monica by her side, Patricia can find reassurance in knowing that she is not alone and that there is a brighter future waiting, even after the storm of divorce.

Sri Lankan player Thilan Samaraweera is taken aboard an ambulance Wednesday in Colombo. Police in Lahore on Wednesday confirmed six police officers and a driver of a van carrying umpires were killed after earlier reports had put the death toll at eight. Six team members were wounded by glass and shrapnel, and two -- Tharanga Paranavitana and Thilan Samaraweera -- were shot in the chest and leg, respectively. Both men were being treated in Colombo and in stable condition, officials said. \\"We are very lucky that no one [sustained] any serious injuries and everyone is in good shape,\\" one player told reporters upon arriving in the capital. \\"There are a few more guys who need more time to recover.

Watch Sri Lankan's foreign minister condemnation of the attack ». Teams have long stayed away from Pakistan, concerned about the security situation in a country that is battling an escalating pro-Taliban insurgency. But Sri Lanka -- a country enduring its own civil war with separatist rebels -- agreed in December to visit for a series of matches, after the Indian cricket team called off its tour following the deadly terror attacks in Mumbai in November. Indian authorities blamed those attacks on Pakistan-based militants. The Pakistan Cricket Board had said it was set to lose more than 16 million as a result of India's cancellation, but the Sri Lanka visit was to help it recoup most of the costs, officials said. The Sri Lankan offer to tour was a reciprocal gesture. Pakistan was one of two countries that agreed to tour Sri Lanka during the 1996 World Cup tournament, while other countries refused to travel there because of security concerns. With this attack, fans now worry that Pakistan won't be able to co-host the 2011 Cricket World Cup with India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Morgan said the ICC's board will be meeting in April to consider whether the Cup will include stops in Pakistan. \\"The board will have to think very carefully about the extent to which Pakistan will be used for that event,\\" Morgan said. \\"It's a very important event, but the safety and security of players, officials and supporters is very important and the board will be taking that into account.\\" Read profiles of the wounded players ». \\"This has really damaged Pakistan,\\" former Pakistani cricket player Zahir Abbas told Geo-TV. \\"Already some teams didn't want to come to Pakistan.

Albert, a well-known and respected figure, took to the stage and addressed the crowd, expressing his gratitude and appreciation for their unwavering support throughout the entire exhibition. As night approached, the crowd gradually dispersed and attendees retreated to their respective homes, eagerly discussing the day's events. Among them was a young man named Bertie, who was fondly called by his family. He was the youngest son in a family of six siblings, each playing an essential role in the Royal Family's success. But Bertie, despite his seemingly cheerful exterior, was burdened by a sense of insecurity, fearing he could never live up to the expectations placed upon him. The following week, the Royal Family convened for their annual \\"first session\\" meeting, where they discussed matters concerning the administration of the Kingdom. The meeting room was filled with a tense atmosphere as it became increasingly apparent that this year's first session was not going well. The members were divided on their opinions on the Kingdom's way forward, and heated exchanges unfolded between them. In particular, the family debated the role of machines and their influence on the British society. The idea of machines playing a significant part in the lives of the Royal Family seemed both contradictory and absurd to many, as it defied the longstanding traditions ingrained in the minds of the populace. It was believed that the charm and elegance of the Royal Family could not be replaced by cold, indifferent machines. The discussion went on for hours, with determined supporters and staunch opposers of the idea unwilling to back down. As the session continued, the subject shifted to a more personal matter: the marriage of Prince Edward, the eldest son of the family. Edward had been seeing a woman whom he wished to marry, but this decision was fraught with complications. As the head of the Church of England, marrying her would put him in direct conflict with the Church's teachings and infuriate the religious establishment. This dilemma tore the family apart, as some believed love should conquer all and others staunchly argued that duty must come first. As the tension within the family reached a boiling point, Bertie took a deep breath, stepped forward, and surprised everyone by speaking up. He argued that while machines might change the way tasks were traditionally done, they could coexist with the elegance and charm of the Royal Family by presenting novel opportunities to innovate and improve, ultimately benefiting the Empire. He acknowledged that change was inevitable and that embracing it could lead to progress. His words resonated with the family members, and they found themselves reassessing their stands on the matter. As for Edward's marriage conundrum, Bertie remained non-committal, stating that it was ultimately Edward's decision to make but urged him to consider his obligations to the Church and the people before making such a life-altering choice. The meeting ended with no definitive resolution, but the family had, for the moment, put aside their differences in the spirit of unity. Bertie's interventions were a turning point, and the members left with a renewed sense of hope and determination to guide their Empire forward in an ever-changing world. As the years passed, the British Royal Family would continue to adapt and evolve, defying expectations and facing challenges head-on. Machines became an essential part of their daily lives, but they retained their unique charm and identity even as the world around them transformed. Through it all, the young, once-insecure Bertie had proven himself a valuable voice of reason and wisdom, helping guide his family through tumultuous times."},{"instruction":"If you're just starting out with the instrument, there's no need to spend an excessive amount of money on a violin, but like most instruments, the quality of the violin generally rises as the price goes up. Expect to spend a few hundred dollars on a decent beginner's violin. Buy full size or 4/4, if you're an adult. The violin is a small instrument, but there are specially designed smaller sizes available. These are generally only intended for younger children, so be sure the violin you're buying is full size unless you're very small. You can ask the shop for a recommendation if you aren't sure. You can also ask the shop to measure your arm length to see what size violin you need. When holding the violin in the playing position, straighten your left arm and the tops of your fingertips should be near the top the violin scroll. If your arm is way past the top, the violin is too small. Buy from a reputable seller. Music stores stake their reputations on selling solid instruments that are free of obvious flaws and damage. As a beginner, you won't be able to coax a very pleasant sound from your instrument for some time, so flaws in privately sold violins might not be apparent to you until it is far too late to complain. Only buy from a store or individual you can trust. Unless you have purchased the instrument only, your violin outfit should come with a violin with four strings, a bow, and a carrying case and most of the time a chin rest and rosin for your bow. In most cases, the person who sells you the violin will be happy to string it for you, which has the added bonus of double-checking to be sure the tuning pegs (the knobs at the scroll, or top, of the violin) are properly fit to the scroll. A hard case is important because violins are such delicate instruments. Strings come in three basic varieties: gut, which is expensive and difficult to take care of, but which offers a complex range of sound; steel, which is loud and bright but can sound scratchy, and synthetic, which is smooth, clear, and not as unpredictable as gut. Each type's name refers to the core material around which metal wire is wrapped to create the string. Most beginners should go with synthetic core strings, such as nylon core. The bow should be new, or newly re-haired. You can check this by looking at the hair of the bow (the fine, white or off-white fibers) and ensuring that the color is uniform and bright along its entire length. The hair of the bow should be a uniform width from end to end. Bows wear down over time. You can get your bow re-haired for a small fee at most music shops. Nearly all violinists use a chin rest, which is a cheap, ergonomic piece of (usually black) plastic that clamps near the base of the violin and allows it to be held securely by your chin. This is usually attached to the violin when the violin is built. Aside from that, be sure you have some rosin (coagulated sap) for your bow, a music stand, and a book of beginner lessons or songs, preferably in a format that will open flat. Some violinists, especially beginners, also purchase a shoulder rest, which is a violin-width pad that sits on your shoulder underneath the violin and makes it easier to hold. Many people start with a shoulder rest and eventually remove it after a few years. If the violin seems to dig into your shoulder when you play, consider purchasing one. Fiddlers, if they sing while performing, often hold the violin in the crook of an arm while playing, with the butt resting against their shoulder. For them, chin rests and shoulder rests are generally pointless. A tuner is a small device that clips on to the scroll or the pegs of the violin. It is useful for beginners if you are teaching yourself, as it can be used to make sure you are playing the notes correctly. But once you know how to play the notes, the tuner isn't of much use anymore except for tuning the instrument itself. Be sure to take it off before big performances though, as it looks unprofessional. Summary:","output":"When starting out with the violin, you can expect to spend a few hundred dollars on a decent beginner's instrument. Make sure to purchase a full size (4/4) violin if you're an adult, and buy from a reputable seller.

In the beginning, a tuner can also be helpful for accurate tuning and practicing notes, but it becomes less necessary as you gain experience. In addition to these essentials, you will need a music stand and beginner lesson books or songs that can open flat for easy learning."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: He had a 12\\" Sony black-and-white, tuned to MTV, sitting on a chair at the end of the bed.

Associated Press. and Daily Mail Reporters. An adorable 3-year-old girl who suffered a heart attack during a dentist visit likely died because she was given the maximum dose of sedative drugs, according to an autopsy report. Finley Puleo Boyle, of Kailua in Honolulu, Hawaii, probably died because of the sedatives and local anesthesia that were administered during her December dental procedure, Honolulu Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Christopher Happy concluded in his autopsy report. He classified the death as an accident. The girl lapsed into a coma on December 3 in the office of Dr. Lilly Geyer at Island Dentistry for Children. She died on January 3. The office has since closed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Finley Boyle, 3, died after being given sedatives during a standard dental procedure. Finley Boyle's devastated mother Ashley (right) took the little girl to the Island Dentistry for Children in Oahu, Hawaii on December 3. The autopsy report said the previously healthy girl had no signs of underlying heart problems or an allergic reaction to the array of sedatives and anesthetic she received in preparation for cavity fillings and root canals, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Friday. The medical examiner noted her teeth were in good shape: 'the oral cavity has native dentition in good repair.' Finley received five drugs, according to the report, including Demerol, hydroxyzine and chlorohydrate. She was also given laughing gas and an injection of a local anesthetic, lidocaine with epinephrine. 'Immediately following the lidocaine injection, the decedent became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest,' Happy said in his report. The girl lapsed into a coma on December 3 in the office of Dr. Lilly Geyer (center) at Island Dentistry for Children. The girl's mother Ashley Boyle (pictured) is traumatized by her daughter's death and has filed a negligence lawsuit against the dentist. Parents Ashley and Evan Boyle filed a negligence lawsuit while their only child was in a coma. Their attorney, Rick Fried, would not comment on the autopsy report. Geyer's attorney, John Nishimoto, has called the allegations 'unproven' but declined to comment further because of the lawsuit. He didn't respond to the newspaper's requests for comment on the autopsy report Thursday. Geyer was issued a license to practice dentistry in the state in July 2005, the Star-Advertiser has previously reported. As of last December, there were no records of complaints against her or her practice on file with the Hawaii Department Of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, according to the newspaper. Ms Boyle is being represented by attorney Richard Fried who called the maximum dosages of five different drugs 'grossly excessive'. He cited the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's standards which warned that young children should be monitored every five minutes and that an extra person should be there to help in case resuscitation is needed. Immediately following the lidocaine injection, Finley Boyle became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest. The procedure on December 3 broke both. of those rules. Instead of checking Finley's oxygen levels every five. minutes, records show she wasn't checked for 26 minutes which explains. why the brain damage was so severe. When. the girl went into cardiac arrest, a doctor from another office had to. be brought in to perform CPR - which Ms Boyle believes is the main. reason her daughter fell into a coma. Ms Boyle was left with the agonizing decision to not resuscitate her daughter, saying that although she held out hope that her daughter would recover she didn't want her to live in a vegetative state.

Ms Boyle has been contacted by. others mothers who got second opinions after visiting Dr Geyer and found. out that her recommendations were 'either totally unnecessary or. somewhat unnecessary' according to Fried. Other mothers said their children had trouble walking for a few days after having work done by Dr Geyer. Ms Boyle calls the botched procedure a 'massive tragedy' that she and her family 'will have to deal with for the rest of our lives.'

He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. and a hint : In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. Please answer this question : Which crop would be less beneficial to farmers, crop A or crop B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Crop B would be less beneficial to farmers. The main reason for this lies in the nature of crop B as explained in the situation above. Unlike crop A, crop B is not tolerant to herbicides. Consequently, utilizing traditional methods such as herbicides to control weeds could negatively impact crop B's yield and quality. This is because these chemicals, while designed to destroy weeds, can also damage crops that have not been genetically engineered to resist them. Weeds are a constant problem for farmers and gardeners, as they compete with crops for essential resources such as water and nutrients. Hence, effective weed management is essential for successful agriculture. In the absence of a herbicide tolerance, a farmer growing crop B would likely have to resort to using time-consuming and labor-intensive manual methods like mechanical or hand weeding to control the weed population. This not only results in additional costs in terms of time and labor, but it is also less efficient and may disrupt the growth of the crops. On the other hand, crop A, which has been genetically engineered to be herbicide tolerant, would significantly reduce these challenges. This modification would allow farmers to effectively use herbicides for weed control without causing collateral damage to the crop. Lesser chemical applications mean reduced costs and potential environmental impacts. The probable yield from crop A would likely be higher because the crop is not being damaged by weed competition or by the measures used to control weeds. In conclusion, crop A's herbicide tolerance represents a significant advantage for farmers seeking to improve their weed management practices and increase yield. Consequently, crop B, lacking this tolerance and therefore being more susceptible to herbicide damage and weed competition, would indeed be less beneficial to farmers."},{"instruction":"Solve this math problem Solve -19*p = 53 + 28 + 109 for p.","output":"Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Her enthusiasm for finding and experimenting with different cookie recipes led her to accumulate an extensive list of options to choose from. Baking perfect cookies can be a challenging task for many reasons. Cookies come in various flavors, textures, and shapes, which makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact method or recipe that will yield the desired outcome. Moreover, personal preferences in taste and texture play a significant role in determining what constitutes a perfect cookie for each individual. When Aubrey came across so many recipes online, it is likely that she was intrigued by the subtle variations in ingredients, techniques, and baking times that each recipe offered. This curiosity may have prompted her to try out as many recipes as possible in order to determine the best one that would satisfy her personal preferences and produce the perfect cookies in her eyes. However, this approach led to an excess of cookies, as Aubrey was constantly baking new batches while testing out different recipes.

Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\".

Which beach was less suitable for surfing and windsurfing? Hint: When wind waves approach to coast area from deep water, the waves change their heights and lengths. The wave height becomes higher and the wavelength becomes shorter as the wave velocity is slowed when ocean waves approach to the shore. If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest become steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower; finally, the ocean waves break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking are different with along to the steepness of shores and waves, and can be categorized by below three types.[11][12] Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, the Coral beach with nice sand and deeper water is less suitable for surfing and windsurfing compared to Surfer beach, which has shallow water. The wave characteristics play a crucial role in determining the suitability of a beach for surfing and windsurfing. As ocean waves approach the shore, the waves change their heights and lengths due to the slowing of wave velocity. The wave height becomes higher and the wavelength becomes shorter. If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest becomes steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower, eventually causing the ocean waves to break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking vary depending on the steepness of the shores and the waves, and can be categorized into three main types. In the case of Coral beach, the deeper water makes it less ideal for surfing and windsurfing. The deep water doesn't allow the waves to develop the necessary steepness and breaking motions that are conducive to surfing or windsurfing activities as the waves may not slow down enough or break properly near the shore. It does, however, make the beach a more desirable destination for families as they can enjoy swimming and playing in the sand without worrying about strong waves. On the other hand, Surfer beach offers shallow water, which is more suitable for surfing and windsurfing. The shallow water allows the waves to slow down and break near the shore, creating steeper crests and broader, shallower troughs that facilitate surfing and windsurfing. The wave characteristics provided by the shallow water and the breaking motions of the waves make Surfer beach the preferred location for surfers. Overall, Surfer beach is more suitable for surfing and windsurfing due to its shallow water, which results in the desirable wave characteristics necessary for these activities. In contrast, the deep water at Coral beach makes it less ideal for surfing and windsurfing but more appropriate for family-oriented activities such as swimming and beach play."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence in Spanish.","output":"\\"El inesperado susurro de las hojas otoñales en la cálida tarde parecía suscitar un aluvión de nostálgicos recuerdos en la mente de aquel anciano cansado y atormentado por el dolor de un pasado que no ha sido capaz de olvidar.\\" Translation: \\"The unexpected whisper of autumn leaves in the warm afternoon seemed to arouse a torrent of nostalgic memories in the mind of that tired old man, tormented by the pain of a past he has not been able to forget.\\""},{"instruction":"Given the question: Process: - Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose - The oxygen travels into the lungs - The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells) - The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart - All cells receive the oxygen.

Let's solve step-by-step:","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we will examine the information given in the premise and see if it's sufficient to support the hypothesis. Let's break down the provided information: 1. The premise contains a baseball player. 2. The player is grabbing a ball in his glove. Now, let's examine the hypothesis: 1. The hypothesis involves the baseball player attempting to turn a double play. A double play occurs when the defensive team records two outs within a single continuous play. In the context of the information given in the premise, we cannot confirm whether the player is attempting to turn a double play or not. Here's why: 1. The premise only describes the player grabbing a ball in his glove; it doesn't provide any information about the game situation or what particular action the player is engaged in. 2. We don't know how many outs there are, the positions of any runners, or even if a play is currently in progress for a double play to be attempted. 3. Grabbing a ball in a glove can occur in various situations, such as catching a fly ball (which would only lead to an out but not involving a double play), making a force out at a base, or retrieving a ground ball to initiate a double play. However, we don't have any specific information to pinpoint whether the player is indeed trying to turn a double play or not. In conclusion, based on the premise provided, we do not have enough information to determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. To establish a connection, we would need more information about the game situation, such as the positions of other players, the base runners, the number of outs, and the specific action the baseball player is taking after grabbing the ball."},{"instruction":"Q:\\"...Life Is but a Dream\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to? A:","output":"\\"Life Is but a Dream\\" belongs to the category of a film or written work. Specifically, it can refer to two different creative works: 1. Film: \\"Life Is but a Dream\\" is a 2013 autobiographical television film and documentary by the popular American singer, songwriter, and actress Beyoncé Knowles. The film was directed and produced by Beyoncé and Ed Burke, and it first premiered on HBO. The documentary provides an intimate and behind-the-scenes look into Beyoncé's life, following her through various stages of her career, personal struggles, and triumphs. It features candid interviews, concert footage, and personal video recordings showcasing her life on and off the stage. Thus, under the category of film, \\"Life Is but a Dream\\" represents a work related to the life and career of the artist Beyoncé Knowles. 2. Written work: The title \\"Life Is but a Dream\\" is also a line from a popular 19th-century poem called \\"The Boat\\" written by Lewis Carroll, an English writer and mathematician. The poem, also known as \\"A Boat Beneath a Sunny Sky,\\" is an acrostic poem that spells out the name \\"Alice Pleasance Liddell,\\" the real-life girl who inspired Carroll's fictional character Alice from his famous stories \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass.\\" The poem presents a reflective and dream-like tone, and the line \\"Life, what is it but a dream?\\" invites readers to consider the ephemeral and surreal nature of existence. As such, under the category of written work, \\"Life Is but a Dream\\" is associated with an important literary work in the context of Lewis Carroll's poetry and his connection with the character Alice.

Introduction: The Spirit of the Times The roaring 50s were a unique time that we'll never forget. This post-war era brought forth an economic boom, a baby boom, and a decorating boom that forever changed the way we treated our homes. It seemed just as important to update our homes as it was to keep our noses in books. In this article, we'll delve into why the mid-century modern movement was the go-to when it came to redecorating and why it seemingly may have stolen the spotlight from intellectual pursuits. The Emergence of Mid-Century Modern The mid-century modern movement hit the design scene in the 1950s. Inspired by German Bauhaus principles and the International Style, this design movement aimed to achieve beauty through functional simplicity and showcased clean lines, contemporary materials, and sleek forms. It was a breath of fresh air from the heavily embellished and traditional designs of earlier decades. The Post-War Economics A significant factor in the rise of the redecorating culture in 1956 was the economic boom. World War II had just come to an end, and economies were rebounding. Consequently, consumers engaged in shopping sprees, stimulating a materialistic culture that had been dormant during the war. For the first time in years, people had the financial ability to purchase new home furnishings, making redecorating an exciting, widespread endeavor. The Influence of Color Television The 1950s saw the birth of color television, which brought vivid images of stylish homes and modern lifestyles into the living rooms of millions. This immersive experience fueled a massive decorating frenzy as homeowners enthusiastically replicated the aesthetic showcased on these TV screens. Suddenly, reading couldn't compete with the allure of creating beautiful, updated spaces. The Influence of Magazines Likewise, the rise of interior design magazines entranced homeowners with an endless supply of design inspiration. Reading these magazines wasn't just an absorbing pastime; it also guided homeowners in crafting their dream interiors. Decorating had stepped into the spotlight. The Changing Lifestyle Dynamics The 1950s was a time of great lifestyle change too. The end of the war signaled the rise of the nuclear family and a shift to suburban living. Leisure became a focus, and with more free time, people were actively looking for ways to adorn their newfound domesticity. As a result, the culture of reading may have taken a backseat to the more absorbing pursuit of creating visually appealing living spaces. The Status Symbol Redecorating became a status symbol during the 1950s. A stylish, well-curated home was reflective of one's financial standing and personal taste. As a result, homeowners prioritized updating their interiors to keep up with the times and establish their social standing in their community. Conclusion: Finding the Balance While it's easy to understand the all-consuming passion for redecorating during the mid-century modern movement, we must remember the value of maintaining a well-rounded life that includes not only homemaking but also intellectual pursuits such as reading. In retrospect, the 1950s may have steered homeowners away from books, but history provides us with valuable lessons. As we celebrate the everlasting charm of mid-century modern design, let us also remember to strike a balance between cultivating aesthetically pleasing spaces and nurturing our minds through the power of literature. There's a unique magic in finding the perfect equilibrium between both."},{"instruction":"Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Finding Joe an irresistable target for his sarcastic on-air wit, a Howard Stern-like deejay named Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller), puts Joe on the air to tell his story. For three days Zander and a growing legion of listeners are surprised to find themselves captivated, delighted, and occasionally repelled by Joe's incredible tale of his search to find the parents who referred to him as \\"Joe Dirt\\" (rather than by his real last name, which he can no longer remember) and left him sitting in a garbage can at the Grand Canyon when he was 8 years old.

Explanation:","output":"To find out the maximum weight of the next person to get in the elevator so that it will not be overloaded, first, we need to determine the total weight of the three adults and the two children who have already entered the elevator. The average weight of the three adults is 140 pounds. To find their total weight, we multiply the average weight by the number of adults: 140 pounds (average weight) * 3 (number of adults) = 420 pounds Similarly, the average weight of the two children is 64 pounds. To find their total weight, we multiply the average weight by the number of children: 64 pounds (average weight) * 2 (number of children) = 128 pounds Now, we add the total weight of the adults and children together to find the combined weight of the people currently in the elevator: 420 pounds (total weight of adults) + 128 pounds (total weight of children) = 548 pounds The elevator sign reads \\"Maximum weight 600 pounds.\\" To find the maximum weight of the next person that can enter the elevator without overloading it, we need to subtract the combined weight of the people currently in the elevator from the maximum weight limit: 600 pounds (maximum weight) - 548 pounds (combined weight of people in the elevator) = 52 pounds So, the maximum weight of the next person to get in the elevator, so that it will not be overloaded, is 52 pounds."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: What is the name of Lewellen's father?

This did not apply to F. Scott Fitzgerald, a screenwriter who had his share of ups and downs in this land. Fitzgerald was not a successful Hollywood writer because he was not good at the career path he chose. He was an amazing novelist, but his efforts of turning them into screenplays ended in disappointment and confusion. It was because of a lack of potential for screenwriting as well as his addiction and desire to be famous. Growing up as a boy, Fitzgerald went to movies a lot. He wanted to write stories that would eventually turn into movies. The problem was: just because Fitzgerald wanted to do something didn't necessarily mean that he was good at it. He made his attempts, but most of these efforts ended in disappointment because he thought about the change from script to screen too much. His plot was too detailed and complicated; his tone was too serious or his dialogue too sentimental . Fitzgerald's quick rise to fame also led to his fall. In life, things are not meant to happen all at once, all that the same time but it did for Fitzgerald. At his best time, three of his early stories were made into short films, including The Great Gatsby and Babylon Revisited. As the twenties approached, he was gradually forgotten by the reading public. He became drunk and constantly took pills both to sleep and wake up. His marriage was destroyed and his wife broke down mentally. He seemed unsure about his life. Fitzgerald had another chance at success when many opportunities came his way, including revisions of Emlyn William's play The Light of Heart and production of one of his own scripts, Cosmopolitan. However, these were all put aside and he was right back where he started, left behind and called a \\"ruined man\\". Fitzgerald simply wanted too much in his life. He wanted \\"to be both a great novelist and a Hollywood success, to write songs like Cole Porter and poetry like John Keats\\". His addiction to fame held him back and led to his...

The player's eyes, which were initially filled with disappointment from the missed shot, now widen with disbelief as he and the two spectators behind him witness an extraordinary turn of events unfold on the basketball court. Hindered by the weight of the heavy defeat that seemed inevitable, the atmosphere in the arena changes as if a charged lightning bolt had just descended from the heavens above. With each passing second, the excitement increases, reaching a fever pitch that the audience can hardly contain. Inexplicably, the ball that had just ricocheted off the rim, spins through the air with an unusual trajectory, much like a boomerang defying gravity, and proceeds to curve its way toward the opposing team's basket. The players on both teams momentarily freeze in shock, attempting to process the incredible and bizarre scene before them. As the ball rapidly gains altitude, it's evident that every individual inside the packed stadium--from the most die-hard fan to the novice who is attending their first game--shares the same thought: Could this be a pivotal moment that reverses the tide and grants the underdog team the triumph they had all but given up on? Leaning forward in anticipation, the two men behind the player exchange awestruck glances, bewildered by the surreal display, which seemed to have plunged the game into an unprecedented dimension. Time seems to slow down as the ball, gleaming under the bright lights, draws closer and closer to the hoop that had moments earlier been in the clutches of what seemed an insurmountable lead. The tension mounts as onlookers silently pray, hoping that the sheer force of their collective will can somehow guide the ball along its unconventional and seemingly impossible path. Then, as if to defy all logic, the unthinkable happens: The ball, moving with a force and precision that defies explanation, hits the backboard at just the right angle, propelling itself through the net with a satisfying swoosh. The silence in the arena is shattered by an explosion of cheers and applause, as the players and spectators alike erupt into a frenzied celebration that seems to shake the very foundations of the building. The once despondent player who had so confidently taken the shot seconds earlier, now finds himself surrounded by a sea of congratulatory pats and shouts of elation. In that surreal moment, as joy and disbelief intertwine, it becomes abundantly clear that the missed shot that had begun the sequence, was, in fact, no accident; rather, it was a testament to the triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity, and a reminder that miracles can manifest in the most unexpected of ways.

The heroic female warrior Britomart (representing both chastity and Elizabeth I) battles through obstacles to reach the chamber in which Amoret is being held, and slays Busirane moments before he is able to kill Amoret.Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was intended by Etty to illustrate the virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart as he prepares to kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she swings her sword.

Jane Harman awaits President Obama's address to a joint session of Congress. Feb. 24, 2009 (AP) Allegations of ethics violations by a handful of Democrats in recent months reached something of a crescendo this week as two prominent members of Congress were accused of corruption. California Rep. Jane Harman denied allegations that she offered to help seek reduced charges for two pro-Israel lobbyists suspected of espionage in exchange for help from a pro-Israel donor, also suspected Israeli agent, in lobbying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to give Harman a key chairmanship. And California Sen. Dianne Feinstein denied that she devised legislation that helped her husband get a federal contract to sell foreclosed properties at compensation rates higher than the industry norms. But the latest cases, which involve Democrats, did not make the same splash that corruption allegations did a few years ago, when Republicans were on the receiving end of the finger-pointing. Some Republican analysts attribute the difference to timing. Democrats have benefited from an \\"Obama media cycle,\\" said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, who served as an aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. Reporters are struggling to keep up with the Obama administration and all the crises it's grappling with, Bonjean told FOXNews.com. In addition, he said, the media and the public have become more desensitized to allegations of corruption against lawmakers after the ones against Republicans. GOP consultant Joe Gaylord, who served as an aide to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, told FOXNews.com he believes GOP values and principles played a role in garnering more attention to ethics accusations against Republican lawmakers. \\"Republicans who have generally used the ethics process become much more susceptible to the hypocrisy charges because they set a high standard for how people should behave,\\" he said. \\"Then when a Republican doesn't behave properly, it becomes a bigger story.\\" A succession of reports and scandals against congressional Republicans ranging from pay-to-play schemes to salacious affairs began more than four years ago when then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay was questioned about his overseas travel and ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who was under federal investigation. Ohio Rep. Bob Ney also got entangled in the Abramoff scandal, and ended up in jail. Another Republican, Rep. Randy \\"Duke\\" Cunningham, resigned his California seat in 2005 after pleading guilty to accepting 2.4 million in bribes and underreporting his income for 2004. In 2006, Florida Rep. Mark Foley resigned when it was learned that he had exchanged raunchy e-mails with a teenage boy who was a former congressional page. In 2007, Idaho Sen. Larry Craig was arrested and pleaded guilty to an undercover sex sting in a men's bathroom at a Minneapolis airport. All five lawmakers are gone from office now. The cumulative effect of these incidents created a perception that Republicans were ethically challenged. Even before Craig's \\"wide stance,\\" Democrats were able to seize on the allegations and regain control of Capitol Hill in 2006, in part by repeating the mantra that they would wipe away the \\"culture of corruption\\" in Congress. But in recent months, Democrats have fallen victim to similar allegations of corruption. While denying wrongdoing on Tuesday, Harman called for a federal investigation into why her conversations were being recorded and why they were leaked to the media. The Office of Congressional Ethics, created by a House resolution on March , 11, 2008, also won't take up the Harman investigation, according to Roll Call, because the OCE rules prevent it from looking at any cases that arose before its creation. Feinstein defended herself Wednesday by pointing out that her legislation to route 25 billion in taxpayer money to a government agency that reportedly awarded her husband's real estate firm a lucrative contract never was enacted into law. Another Democrat, Pennsylvania Rep. Jack Murtha, is facing a federal probe for purportedly steering defense appropriations to clients of KSA Consulting, which employed his brother Robert, and the PMA Group, founded by Paul Magliocchetti, a former senior staffer on the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Defense. New York Rep. Charlie Rangel is being investigated by the House Ethics Committee in at least four areas, including his reported failure to properly report income taxes on a Caribbean villa in the Dominican Republic; use of four, rent-controlled apartments in Harlem; questions about an offshore firm asking Rangel for special tax exemptions; and whether Rangel improperly used House stationery to solicit donations for a school of public affairs named after him at City College of New York. Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the main difference between the current Democratic scandals and the ones that routed the Republicans is that now \\"it's not one big scandal easily understood.\\" She explained that many of ethics accusations against Republicans a few year ago were linked to Abramoff. \\"It was one issue,\\" she said. \\"Now we're looking at lots of different little issues.\\" But she warned that the allgegations against Democrats could add up to a death by a thousand cuts. \\"The Democrats have something to worry about here,\\" she said. \\"There will be a critical mass when it will look like Democrats have a huge ethical problem. And the Democrats who have not been taking the problems very seriously ignore them at their peril.\\" Bonjean when it comes to rallying voter outrage \\"timing is everything.\\" Right now, the focus of anti-tax tea partiers and others critical of Washington is on government spending, bank bailouts, legal rights for terror suspects and Bush administration-era interrogation techniques. \\"There's only so much oxygen in the room for what it is that's going to get covered and what becomes important,\\" added Gaylord. \\"And in this age, when there is a crisis a minute ... it moves the individual activities of congressmen and congresswomen, no matter how corrupt it might be, down on the scale of importance. \\"The Obama administration, with everything it is changing, is providing cover for Democratic corruption,\\" he said. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses how allegations of ethics violations involving Democratic members of Congress have not attracted as much attention as similar allegations against Republicans in the past. The author suggests that the current focus on the Obama administration and a desensitized public could be contributing factors. In recent months, multiple Democrats have faced accusations of corruption, but these cases have not generated the same level of media coverage or public outrage. Some experts warn that Democrats should not ignore these allegations, as they could lead to long-term consequences if they are perceived as having a significant ethical problem."},{"instruction":"Question: Process: - Waves hit the coast - Waves have energy that pushes the water and sediment - The sediment can help erode land like sandpaper - Water washes the sediment back - Some sediment is left as sand. Question: suppose human population increases happens, how will it affect less waves hit the coast. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"As the human population increases, there would be several factors that could potentially affect the coastal wave dynamics and the associated erosion processes. The potential impacts might be a result of increased coastal development, urbanization, and climate change due to human activities. However, it is essential to consider a multitude of factors when assessing these impacts. To understand the possible effects of an increasing human population on the wave patterns and their influence on coastal erosion, let's break down the components and analyze each of them in more detail. 1. Coastal Development: With more people living near the coast, more infrastructure and facilities would be required. This could lead to constructing more seawalls, breakwaters, and other coastal defense structures, which can disrupt the wave patterns, leading to either more or less wave energy reaching the shore. It could also lead to altered currents and circulation patterns that could further impact the way sediment is eroded, transported, and deposited along the coastline. This could result in a change in sediment supply and availability, influencing beach and coastal erosion processes. 2. Urbanization: With higher population density, urbanization would lead to increased land-use change, such as deforestation and increased impervious surfaces, affecting the sediment flow and water balance in nearby rivers. This could cause both increased sediment influx due to higher erosion rates and reduced sediment supply due to dams and other constructions. If the shoreline is exposed to a higher sediment supply, the ability of waves to erode the coast could decrease, as more sediment particles would absorb the wave energy. Conversely, if sediment supply is reduced, the eroding capacity of waves could increase, as they would have less material to move. 3. Climate Change: Human-induced activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, contribute to climate change and long-term shifts in wave patterns. As the climate changes, the strength, direction, and frequency of coastal storms could also change, possibly leading to more intense or less frequent waves hitting the shore. These changes might directly impact the energy with which waves can erode and transport sediment along the coast. Considering the above factors, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the impact of an increasing human population would result in more, less, or no significant effect on waves hitting the coast and their ability to erode the shoreline. It largely depends on the specific region, government policies, and environmental factors at play. However, the overall trend suggests that an increasing human population will likely result in altered coastal development and increased global climate change, with various impacts on coastal wave dynamics and erosion processes. This could translate into either more, less, or a mixed effect on the ability of waves to erode the coast, depending on the location and a myriad of other factors. As such, it is crucial for policymakers and planners to take these potential impacts into consideration when designing coastal management strategies to minimize adverse outcomes and ensure sustainable coastal environments."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was a highly intelligent and religious woman Joséphine-Éléonore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn (1825–1860) married Albert de Broglie on 18 June 1845, and they had five sons together. Although not high royalty, on the occasion of their marriage, they styled themselves Prince and Princesse respectively. Pauline was a highly intelligent and religious woman, who was well read and wrote a number of texts in her lifetime. Her shyness was well known; she was widely considered strikingly beautiful and charming, but those around her would often avoid eye contact so as not to embarrass her. Albert was devoted to his wife, and commissioned the painting after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister, the Comtesse d'Haussonville. Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. Ingres dined with the de Broglie family in January 1850, and according to one eye witness, \\"seemed to be very happy with his model.\\"Although Ingres' main source of income came from portraiture, it distracted from his main interest in history painting, which early in his career, was far less lucrative. He found acclaim in the 1840s, when he became successful enough to no longer depend on commissions. This painting was Ingres' second-last female portrait, and final society portrait.Influenced by the working methods of Jacques-Louis David, Ingres began with a number of nude preparatory sketches, for which he employed professional models. He built up a picture of the sitter's underlying anatomical structure, as seen in the Musée Bonnat study, before deciding on how to build the lavish costume and accessories. Although there is no surviving record of the commissions, and the exact sequence of events is uncertain, the sketches can be dated from 1850, the year the style of her evening dress came into fashion. Ingres signed and dated the final picture at the left center \\"J. INGRES. pit 1853\\".Pauline died in 1860 aged 35 from tuberculosis.

How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea?

Where can I hire a hacker? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information - how to find and hire a legitimate hacker without getting scammed. Here's a detailed answer to help guide you through this process: 1. Know your needs: Before looking for a hacker, it's important to have a clear understanding of what you need the hacker for, as this can impact the type of hacker you're searching for. There are various types/types of hackers, including ethical (white hat), criminal (black hat), and those who sit somewhere in between (grey hat). It is recommended that you search for ethical hackers, as they use their skills for legitimate purposes and are less likely to scam you. 2. Research: Once you know what you need, start by doing thorough research. Look through forums like HackForums, exploit, or GitHub repositories for projects related to your needs. Read reviews, feedback, and user experiences to gather more information about potential hacking services. It's best to use this research to compile a list of potential hacking candidates. 3. Verify their reputation: Dig deep into the reputation of the hacker you intend to work with. Check their references, reviews, ratings, and look for any red flags or warning signs that might indicate scams or unethical behavior. Reach out to the contacts provided for verification or ask for recommendations from reliable sources. 4. Look for certifications: Professional hackers (ethical hackers) usually possess some certifications, such as Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), or Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC). These certifications help confirm that the individual is a legitimately skilled and knowledgeable professional in the field of ethical hacking. 5. Direct contact: Reach out to the potential hacker and discuss your needs. Be mindful of how they communicate and respond to your queries – a legitimate hacker will be more likely to have good communication skills and display professionalism. Trust your instincts – if something feels off or too good to be true, consider looking elsewhere. 6. Ask for a written agreement: When hiring a hacker, make sure to get a written contract or agreement stating the terms, conditions, scope of work, and pricing. This not only helps avoid miscommunication but also adds a layer of protection from potential fraud or scams. 7. Stay cautious: Remember that providing sensitive information or access to your personal data is a risk. Avoid sharing passwords or critical information until you feel confident in the hacker's legitimacy and professionalism. 8. Keep a record: Document your communication with the hacker, including emails, agreements, invoices, and reports, in case any disputes or issues arise in the future. 9. Escrow Services: In case of making any payments, opt for an escrow service if possible. An escrow service is a third-party that holds the payment until the agreed terms and conditions are met. This ensures the security of your funds and reduces the likelihood of scams or frauds. Please note that this guidance is geared towards helping you find and work with ethical hackers or professionals who specialize in cybersecurity and are not intended to assist in hiring individuals for malicious or illegal activities. It's crucial to stay within the boundaries of the law when seeking assistance from professionals in the hacking world."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence based on \\"president extends respect to french president\\"","output":"In a demonstration of international diplomacy and good will, the sitting President has extended deep respect and appreciation to the French President, highlighting the robust collaboration that has underscored the profound relationship between the two nations.

However, it does not directly answer the question of why the Chinese government denounced the accord. To provide a comprehensive response to this question, we need to consider the Simla Accord of 1914 and the broader political context of the time. The Simla Accord was a convention signed in 1914 between British India, Tibet, and China, which sought to define the boundaries between Tibet, British India (particularly in the region of what is now Arunachal Pradesh), and China. A central aspect of the accord was the McMahon Line, a boundary proposed by British colonial administrator Sir Henry McMahon, which delineated the borders between India's northeastern states and Tibet. The Chinese government denounced the Simla Accord for several reasons: 1. Territorial sovereignty: China refuted the McMahon Line as a demarcation because it encroached upon what it claimed to be traditional Chinese territory. The McMahon Line placed a large swath of land, known today as Arunachal Pradesh, within the boundaries of British India. China insisted that this was an unjustified appropriation of its territory and violated its territorial sovereignty. 2. Non-recognition of Tibet's autonomy: The Republic of China, established by the Xinhai Revolution, viewed Tibet as an integral part of its territory and did not recognize its autonomy. By engaging in negotiations with British India and Tibet as equal parties, the Simla Accord seemed to undermine China's assertions about its sovereignty over Tibet, which was unacceptable to the Chinese government. 3. Perceived British imperialism: The Chinese government, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, had been repeatedly pushed into unequal treaties and forced concessions by European powers, particularly Great Britain. The Chinese government saw the Simla Accord as another example of British imperialism, using diplomacy to achieve territorial gains at the expense of China. 4. Unfair representation and coercion: China did not believe they had fair representation at the Simla Convention, as they were not involved in the drafting of the boundary agreement between British India and Tibet. They also felt coerced into signing the accord, as the participants threatened to sign a bilateral agreement between Britain and Tibet if China refused, further undermining China's claims to both land and political control of the region. To sum up, the Chinese government denounced the Simla Accord for a combination of factors, some of which are intertwined. China's territorial sovereignty, concerns over the recognition of Tibet's autonomy, perceived British imperialism, and an objection to the negotiation process of the convention led the Chinese government to denounce the accord and continue to contest the legitimacy of the defined borders today."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Gomez and Morticia Addams hire a nanny, Debbie, to take care of their new son Pubert.

A cancer is the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and feeling tired all the time. Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous. Bowel cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects. Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not curable, with management being directed... - Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 510% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to. The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with... - Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of... - The Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation ( Meso Foundation , formerly MARF ) is a non-profit organization that funds mesothelioma research , provides services to patients , educates the public , and advocates in Washington , DC for governmental funding for mesothelioma research . The organization 's mission is to eradicate mesothelioma , a cancer caused by exposure to asbestos , as a life - ending disease . Its donors include lawyers , companies that have manufactured asbestos products and victims , along with their family and friends . To date , the foundation has funded over 8.2 million in clinical research and is the host of the annual International Symposium on Malignant Mesothelioma . - Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains. The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 1015% of cases occur in people who have never smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance. Prevention is by avoiding risk factors including smoking and air pollution. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world. Signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include: - Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is cancer developing from the lining of the stomach. Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes. The most common cause is infection by the bacterium \\"Helicobacter pylori\\", which accounts for more than 60% of cases. Certain types of \\"H. pylori\\" have greater risks than others. Other common causes include eating pickled vegetables and smoking. About 10% of cases run in families and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas. This type can be divided into a number of subtypes. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy. This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. Japan and South Korea, two countries that have high rates of the disease, screen for stomach cancer. A Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of cancer as does the stopping of smoking. There is tentative evidence that treating \\"H. pylori\\" decreases the future risk. If cancer is treated early, many cases can be cured. Treatments may include some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. If treated late, palliative care may be advised. Outcomes are often poor with a less than 10% 5-year survival rate globally. This is largely because most people with the condition present with advanced disease. In the United States 5-year survival is 28% while in South Korea it is over 65% partly due to... - Silic (19952013) is a French Thoroughbred racehorse who competed both in France and in the United States. His most notable win came in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Mile. - A brain tumor or intracranial neoplasm occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondary tumors that have spread from somewhere else, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking, and with sensation. As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur. The cause of most brain tumors is unknown. Uncommon risk factors include inherited neurofibromatosis, exposure to vinyl chloride, EpsteinBarr virus, and ionizing radiation. The evidence for mobile phones is not clear. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity. Treatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur. Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor. Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention. Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied. Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the... - Asbestos is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals, which all have in common their eponymous asbestiform habit: long (roughly 1:20 aspect ratio), thin fibrous crystals, with each visible fiber composed of millions of microscopic \\"fibrils\\" that can be released by abrasion and other processes. They are commonly known by their colors, as \\"blue asbestos\\", \\"brown asbestos\\", \\"white asbestos\\", and \\"green asbestos\\". - Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic defects such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy of any concerning skin lesion. Using sunscreen and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma. Treatment is typically removal by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may be tested for spread. Most people are cured if spread has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment the five-year survival rates in the United States is 98% among those with localized disease and 17% among those in whom spread has occurred. The likelihood that it will come back or spread depends how thick the melanoma is, how fast the cells are dividing, and whether or not the overlying skin has broken down. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, it occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. There are also high rates in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Melanoma is more common in men than women. Melanoma has become more... - The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 1533 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. - Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease. The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. The infection has been preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization in the first day of life if... - Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The most common area affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding the testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly. Greater than 80% of mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people have been exposed to asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos. Often it is around 40 years between exposure and the cancer starting. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the cancer. Prevention centers around reducing exposure to asbestos. Treatment often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A procedure known as pleurodesis, which involves using substances such as talc to scar together the pleura, may be used to prevent more fluid from building up around the lungs. Chemotherapy often includes the medications cisplatin and pemetrexed. The percentage of people that survive five years following diagnosis is on average 8% in the United States. In 2013 about 50,000 people had mesothelioma and 34,000 died from the disease. Rates of mesothelioma vary in different areas of the world. Rates are higher in Australia, the United Kingdom, and lower in... - Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to specialized medical care for people with life-limiting illnesses. It focuses on providing people with relief from the symptoms, pain, physical stress, and mental stress of the terminal diagnosis. The goal of such therapy is to improve quality of life for both the person and their family. Evidence as of 2016 supports improvement in quality of life. - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and feeling tired. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow growing while others are fast growing. Lymphomas are types of cancer that develops from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Risk factors include poor immune function, autoimmune diseases, \\"Helicobacter pylori\\" infection, hepatitis C, obesity, and \\"Epstein-Barr virus\\" infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies lymphomas into five major groups, including one for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Within the four groups for NHL there are over 60 specific types of lymphoma. Diagnosis is by examination of a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Medical imaging is done to help with cancer staging. Treatment depends on if the lymphoma is slow or fast growing and if it is in one area or many areas. Treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, stem cell transplantation, surgery, or watchful waiting. If the blood becomes overly thick due to antibodies, plasmapheresis may be used. Radiation and some chemotherapy, however, increase the risk of other cancers, heart disease or nerve problems over the subsequent decades. In 2013 about 2.96 million people had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 226,000 died. In the United States 2.1% of people are affected at some point in their life. The most common age of diagnosis is between 65 to 75 years old. The percentage of people who survive five years in the United States is 71%. - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at... - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two together along with a number of less common skin cancers are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, that may be shiny with small blood vessel running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer. Squamous-cell cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer. Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds. Greater than 90% of cases are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This exposure increases the risk of all three main types of skin cancer. Exposure has increased partly due to a thinner ozone layer. Tanning beds are becoming another common source of ultraviolet radiation. For melanomas and basal-cell cancers exposure during childhood is particularly harmful. For squamous-cell cancers total exposure, irrespective of when it occurs, is more important. Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles. People with light skin are at higher risk as are those with poor immune function such as from medications or HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Decreasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually curable. Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may less commonly involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as... - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. - Lymphoma is a group of blood cell tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name often refers to just the cancerous ones rather than all such tumors. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night. There are dozens of subtypes of lymphomas. The two main categories of lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The World Health Organization (WHO) includes two other categories as types of lymphoma: multiple myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases. About 90% of lymphomas are non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Lymphomas and leukemias are a part of the broader group of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Risk factors for Hodgkin lymphoma include infection with EpsteinBarr virus and a history of the disease in the family. Risk factors for common types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas include autoimmune diseases, HIV/AIDS, infection with human T-lymphotropic virus, immunosuppressant medications, and some pesticides. Eating large amounts of red meat and tobacco smoking may also increase the risk. Diagnosis, if enlarged lymph nodes are present, is usually by lymph node biopsy. Blood, urine, and bone marrow testing may also be useful in the diagnosis. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. Lymphoma most often spreads to the lungs, liver, and/or brain. Treatment may involve one or more of the following: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery. In some non-Hodgkin lymphomas, an increased amount of protein produced by the lymphoma cells causes the blood to become so thick that plasmapheresis is performed to remove the protein. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for certain types. The outcome depends on the subtype with some being curable and treatment prolonging survival in most. The five-year survival rate in the United States... - Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or esophageal and gastric varices. HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk. There is no vaccine against hepatitis C. Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who use intravenous drugs and testing donated blood. Chronic infection can be cured about 90% of the time with treatments that include the medications sofosbuvir or simeprevir. Previous to this a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin was used which had a cure rate around 50% and greater side effects. Getting access to the newer treatments however can be expensive. Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. Hepatitis C is the leading reason for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation. An estimated 130200 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C. In 2013 about 11 million new cases occurred. It occurs most commonly in Africa and Central and East Asia. About... - Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to be involved in the development of more than 90% of cases; most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread. HPV vaccines protect against between two and seven high-risk strains of this family of viruses and may prevent up to 90% of cervical cancers. As a risk of cancer still exists, guidelines recommend continuing regular Pap smears. Other methods of prevention include: having few or no sexual partners and the use of condoms. Cervical cancer screening using the Pap smear or acetic acid can identify precancerous changes which when treated can prevent the development of cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer may consist of some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Five year survival rates in the United States are 68%. Outcomes, however, depend very much on how early the cancer is detected. Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an estimated 528,000 cases of cervical cancer occurred, with 266,000... - Prostate cancer, also known as carcinoma of the prostate, is the development of cancer in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow relatively quickly. The cancer cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. It may initially cause no symptoms. In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or when urinating. A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells. Factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States it is more common in the African American population than the white American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Prostate cancer screening is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due to the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention. Supplementation with vitamins or minerals does not... Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'inception' with '1999'.

It was his first publication outside magazines, and immediately won him a reputation as a significant poet. This narrative poem takes the form of a dialogue between the aged Irish hero Oisín and St. Patrick, the man traditionally responsible for converting Ireland to Christianity. Most of the poem is spoken by Oisin, relating his three-hundred year sojourn in the isles of Faerie. Oisin has not been a popular poem with critics influenced by modernism, who dislike its pre-Raphaelite character. However, Harold Bloom defended this poem in his book-length study of Yeats, and concludes that it deserves reconsideration. - The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland, in Dublin, Republic of Ireland, first opened its doors to the public on 27 December 1904. Despite losing its original building to a fire in 1951, it has remained active to the present day. The Abbey was the first state-subsidized theatre in the English-speaking world; from 1925 onwards it received an annual subsidy from the Irish Free State. Since July 1966, the Abbey has been located at 26 Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1. - The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems was the first collection of poems by W. B. Yeats . It was published in 1889 .

To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid. Which test would need higher temperature, case A or case B? Hint: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. A:","output":"Based on the hint provided, we can infer that polar compounds generally have higher melting and boiling points compared to nonpolar compounds. This is because polar molecules have stronger intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonds, which require more energy to overcome before the molecules can move apart and change states from solid to liquid or liquid to gas. In Mike's experiments, compound A is a polar compound, and compound B is a nonpolar compound. When comparing case A (changing the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid) and case B (changing the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid), it would require a higher temperature to achieve this state change in case A, the polar compound. The additional energy needed for case A is due to the hydrogen bonds and other intermolecular forces present in the polar compound. These forces hold the molecules together more strongly than the forces in nonpolar compounds. Consequently, more energy is required in the form of higher temperatures to separate the molecules and change the state of the substance in case A. To sum up, case A, the test involving changing the state of the polar compound (compound A) from solid to liquid, would require a higher temperature than case B, which involves changing the state of the nonpolar compound (compound B) from solid to liquid."},{"instruction":"Information: - At the end of each Major League Baseball season, the league leaders of various statistical categories are announced.

But designer Mikhail Belyaev doesn't think that forgetting to check the weather report before going out should cause you to get wet in the rain. That's why he created the Lampbrella--a lamp post with its own \\"umbrella\\". The designer says he came up with the idea after watching people get wet on streets in Russia. \\"Once, I was driving on a central Saint Petersburg street and saw people trying to hide from the rain under the street lamps. I thought it would be a good idea to have a Lampbrella built into a street lamp.\\" he said. The Lampbrella is a street lamp fitted with an umbrella canopy . It has an inside electric motor which can open or close the umbrella freely. The Lampbrella will offer people cover whenever it starts raining. After three minutes of not being used the canopy is closed. According to the designer, the Lampbrella would move at a very low speed in order not to cause harm to people. What's more, it would be grounded to protect from a possible lightning hit. Each Lampbrella would offer enough cover for several people. Being 2 meters off the ground, it would only be a danger for the tallest man. While there are no plans to take the Lampbrella into production , Belyaev says he recently introduced his creation to one Moscow company, and insists his creation could be on any street where a lot of people walk but there are no canopies to provide cover. According to the passage, for what purpose did Belyaev create the Lampbrella? A) To know when there'll be a heavy rain. B) To check the weather report. C) To protect people from the rain.

Should I validate this answer? [1]. No [2]. Yes Answer:","output":"This question concerns the identification and classification of an SD memory card reader. Before validating the suggested answer, it's crucial to understand what an SD memory card reader is fundamentally. An SD (Secure Digital) card reader is a device that allows computers to read SD cards, which are typically used in many electronics for storage, such as digital cameras, mobile phones, and media players. It facilitates the transfer of data between the card and the device. These are commonly connected to the device via USB and come in various shapes and sizes, which can accommodate a single SD card or multiple cards of varying formats. The suggested answer provides a classification based on the type and quantity of the card slots. It introduces the concept of single card readers that solely accept one SD card, multi card readers that are capable of reading varied types of cards (for example, SD, microSD, CompactFlash etc.), and series card readers that can take multiple SD cards simultaneously. Although the suggested answer appropriately describes these categories and gives examples, it isn't completed as it doesn't provide the definition of an SD memory card reader. The answer could be improved by providing a brief definition at the beginning. So, to conclude, while the proposed answer partakes some relevant and correct information, it should not be validated as a perfect and comprehensive response to the question. It would be appropriate to include a clear and concise definition of an SD memory card reader for optimum understanding.

Q: The political landscape in the United States looks a bit different in the wake of Tuesday's Senate election victory by Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama. In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat.

The bank building was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building.

Washington was able to run the ball all day and Ladell Betts, who finished with 171 rushing yards, led the Redskins to a 3-0 lead after their first drive with kicker Shaun Suisham getting the field goal. The Eagles responded with three straight touchdowns. An interception by rookie linebacker Omar Gaither set up a Jeff Garcia to L.J. Smith touchdown.

Answer choices: - fibrous - lipids - roots - sodium - keratin - solutes - fibers - stems A:","output":"Some flowers use their roots to store most of their water. In many plant species, roots play a crucial role in not only the absorption of water from the surrounding soil but also in the storage of water (and nutrients) to help the plant survive during spells of drought or unfavorable conditions. Different species of plants have evolved diverse root systems to cater to their specific needs, and some plants are adapted to store more significant portions of water in their roots. While stems are the primary water storage structure in some plants (such as cacti), roots serve as the primary water storage system in many other species of flowers and plants. The roots of these plants have evolved to have specialized structures that allow them to efficiently take in and store water from the surrounding environment. Some plants have tuberous roots, which are modified, swollen underground roots, for this purpose. A well-known example of a plant with a tuberous root adapted for water storage is the dahlia. In addition, many desert plants, such as the mesquite tree, have developed deep roots to access water stored far beneath the ground surface. In contrast, other answer choices do not refer to structures that are primarily involved in water storage: - Fibrous roots refer to a root system that consists of many branches and does not include a primary taproot. While fibrous roots do absorb water, they are not specialized structures for water storage. - Lipids, sodium, keratin, and solutes are not structures within a plant but rather molecules or compounds. Lipids are fats and waxes mainly responsible for energy storage, while sodium and solutes are elements often found dissolved in a plant's internal fluids. Keratin is a protein found in hair, nails, and the outer layer of human skin, and not found in plants. - Fibers are a type of tissue found in the cell walls of plants, often in the form of lignin and cellulose, which help provide structural support. Fibers also do not function primarily in water storage. - Stems are already mentioned in the question; some flowers use stems for water storage, but the question asks for another structure involved in water storage for other flowers. In conclusion, among the given answer choices, roots are the primary structure that some flowers utilize to store most of their water, providing essential support and resources for their growth and survival during periods of water scarcity."},{"instruction":"Přišel jsem na to.

A formal system need not be mathematical as such; for example, Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\" imitates the form of Euclid's \\"Elements\\".. Spinoza employed Euclidiean elements such as \\"axioms\\" or \\"primitive truths\\", rules of inferences etc. so that a calculus can be build using these. For nature of such primitive truths, one can consult Tarski's \\"Concept of truth for a formalized language\\". - In logic, a substructural logic is a logic lacking one of the usual structural rules (e.g. of classical and intuitionistic logic), such as weakening, contraction, exchange or associativity. Two of the more significant substructural logics are relevant logic and linear logic. - In mathematical logic, a sequent is a very general kind of conditional assertion. - In mathematics, a theorem is a statement that has been proved on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theoremsand generally accepted statements, such as axioms. A theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally \\"deductive\\", in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is \\"experimental\\". - In logic, a rule of inference, inference rule or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or conclusions). For example, the rule of inference called \\"modus ponens\\" takes two premises, one in the form \\"If p then q\\" and another in the form \\"p\\", and returns the conclusion \\"q\\". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion. - Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature. - In proof theory, a structural rule is an inference rule that does not refer to any logical connective, but instead operates on the judgment or sequents directly. Structural rules often mimic intended meta-theoretic properties of the logic. Logics that deny one or more of the structural rules are classified as substructural logics. - Idempotency of entailment is a property of logical systems that states that one may derive the same consequences from many instances of a hypothesis as from just one . This property can be captured by a structural rule called contraction , and in such systems one may say that entailment is idempotent if and only if contraction is an admissible rule . Rule of Contraction : from A , C , C B is derived A , C B. Or in sequent calculus notation , frac ( Gamma , C , C vdash B ) ( Gamma , C vdash B ) - In logic, a rule of inference is admissible in a formal system if the set of theorems of the system does not change when that rule is added to the existing rules of the system. In other words, every formula that can be derived using that rule is already derivable without that rule, so, in a sense, it is redundant. The concept of an admissible rule was introduced by Paul Lorenzen (1955). - Paul Lorenzen (March 24, 1915 October 1, 1994) was a German philosopher and mathematician, founder of the Erlangen School (with Wilhelm Kamlah) and inventor of game semantics (with Kuno Lorenz).

He travels to Nepal and discovers that Abner has died, and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter Marion. Jones visits Marion at her tavern, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander, Arnold Toht. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece, but when Jones returns to the bar to fight the Nazis and save Marion, her bar is accidentally set on fire; during the fight, the headpiece ends up in the fire and Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece, and flees the tavern screaming. Indy and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion decides to accompany Indy in his search for the Ark so he can repay his debt to her.

Question: Following the end of the period of Greek influence, what major ancient power took control of Egypt? Context: The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism.

(Holger Leue/LPI) Rome is quite possibly the worldâs most romantic city and even a weekend visitor can feel entirely at home here. It is easy to fall madly in love with the tones of amber and rose and terracotta, the ancient villas and pillars, the effortless chic of both men and women and the eminently walkable neighborhoods, each one distinct. It is no wonder the city has a thriving ex-pat community, eager to fit in and enjoy la bella figura. What is it known for? Rome's history is part of its present: walking around the deserted Circus Maximus or through the Roman Forum, the ghosts of the city come alive. But it is certainly not weighing anyone down, or slowing them down, as you will find if you attempt to drive in Rome. You will find that the rhythm of life (outside of a car) is important to the citizens: where you have your morning espresso, taking time to enjoy lunch or dinner, having family supplies of homemade wine. When in Rome, do as the Romans do and enjoy yourself. Romans are spoiled with great restaurants and markets, truly affordable public transport and some of Europe's best shopping when the monster sales are on in January and July, making the Euro go farther. The politics might be an eternal mess in the Eternal City, but it makes up for it with magical sights like the moment at dusk when the bulk of St Peter's Basilica is traced in black against a purple sky. Where do you want to live? Although many people want to live in the neighborhoods of Rome's historic center, such as Trastevere, it is expensive and there is little green space. \\"There is a lot of smog and it is not near many parks,\\" said Nina Farrell, club manager of the American International Club of Rome. Another popular area is Prati, a wealthy and beautiful neighborhood with great shopping. Piazza Bologna, a bit further out near the University of Rome, is more affordable and residential and only a few metro stops from the city center. Side trips If you're anxious to see the Duomo di Milano or Michelangelo's David, you can catch frequent trains north to Florence (a mere hour and a half on the Eurostar), Milan and Venice. Or head south to Sperlonga and Naples, or venture farther afield for adventures like skiing in the Dolomites (less than five hours by train) and exploring the hill towns of Sicily, a short flight away. Rome is also a great jumping off point for day trips to Tivoli and the Villa d'Este, or the beautiful gardens at Villa Lante in Bagnaia. For devoted and determined shoppers, the Fashion District outlet stores (www.fashiondistrict.it) in Valmontone will be a sure destination. Practical info Housing is expensive, especially as you get closer to the city's center, and the market does not seem to have taken a hit in the current recession. Most of what is for sale is apartments, not houses, and many people rent. \\"You can spend half a million euros and get an apartment with no balcony, no land,\\" said Farrell. It is not only the prices that put people off, but the red tape and expense ­- a notary might get up to 10 to 15,000 euros for an closing or exchange. \\"It takes a long time to buy,\\" said Farrell, who has been through the process herself. But while the process is somewhat complicated, steady high prices and demand mean that property is a solid investment.

Which player for the Minneapolis Lakers in 1947-48 was nicknamed Mr. Basketball? Answer:","output":"The player who was nicknamed \\"Mr. Basketball\\" for the Minneapolis Lakers in 1947-48 was George Mikan. Born on June 18, 1924, in Joliet, Illinois, George Lawrence Mikan Jr. became one of the most dominant and influential players in the early years of professional basketball. Standing 6 feet 10 inches tall, Mikan was almost an anomaly in the sport during that time due to his imposing height and physical presence. Mikan started his basketball career at DePaul University, where he played under the guidance of legendary coach Ray Meyer. He revolutionized the game with his remarkable scoring and shot-blocking abilities. Due to his physical stature and skills, the NCAA introduced the goaltending rule in 1945, which prohibited a player from touching the ball on its downward flight after a field goal attempt. This rule was later adopted by the NBA as well. After his college career, George Mikan joined the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League (NBL). However, the team disbanded after just one season, and Mikan found himself being drafted by the Minneapolis Lakers in 1947. The Lakers were part of the NBL before they became a founding member of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), the precursor to the NBA. Mikan's career skyrocketed with the Lakers during the 1947-48 season. He quickly gained widespread recognition, ultimately leading to the nickname, \\"Mr. Basketball.\\" As the centerpiece of the team, Mikan helped the Lakers win the NBL title in his debut season with a scoring average of 21.3 points per game. The following year, the Lakers started participating in the newly-formed NBA and continued their winning tradition with Mikan as the team's star player. The Lakers won five NBA championships in six years (1949, 1950, 1952, 1953, and 1954) with Mikan as their leader. In the 1948-49 season, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP). In addition to his scoring prowess, Mikan was a force to be reckoned with defensively. He led the league in blocked shots multiple times, proving to be an imposing presence in the paint. Despite suffering numerous injuries during his career, Mikan's impact on the game remained substantial. George Mikan retired in 1956 as the all-time leading scorer in professional basketball history with 11,764 points. In honor of his contributions to the sport, Mikan was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959. To this day, his legacy continues as one of the pioneers who paved the way for the modern basketball big man, and his nickname \\"Mr. Basketball\\" stands as testament to his influence and impact on the sport."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

The app boasts a sleek and user-friendly interface, making it a breeze to navigate through chats and multimedia. Its extensive set of features including secure end-to-end encryption, secret chats, and customizable themes leaves one impressed. However, there are a few drawbacks that prevent it from being a perfect app. Occasionally, I have experienced delays in receiving notifications, causing me to miss important messages at times. Another area that could use some improvement is the photo-sharing quality. Higher-resolution images tend to get compressed more than I'd like, resulting in the loss of some detail. Despite these minor issues, org.telegram.messenger remains a reliable app for staying in touch with friends and family.

Bea was diagnosed with this disease when she was five months old. Since then, the hospital has become her second home, medicines for food, and all kinds of treatments her friends. Bea received a very special treatment when she was four years old, which would allow her to be like a normal child if successful. After that, she spent two weeks in ICU before living for four months on a separate ward . Bea was allowed home in February but still needed a special tube in her nose to send in medicines every two days. Her parents clean the house from top to bottom every two days and hoover each morning to make sure Bea is free from any possible bacteria. Anna, Bea's mother, said, \\"she is weak but so strong. We've never seen any child stronger than her. It seems as if nothing in the world could beat her. We really hope to send her to school next year.\\" She used to drive on the local playground, but Bea was only allowed to watch sitting in the car. \\"It was heartbreaking to see Bea staring at the running and laughing children there.

So she picks up the phone. He takes the phone away from her and assaults her. She bites his hand, and he hits her hard enough to knock her out and lay her out on the floor. Now thoroughly angry, Morely picks up the nearest handy object, a pillow, and smothers her with it. Once she is dead, he puts the pillow back onto the bed, picks her up, lays her out on the bed, takes the cigarette from the ashtray, and places it in her hand.

Step l: Making A List Of Colleges To Apply To With over 6,000 colleges in the United States, the first step in applying to college is to do some research and make a college list . This process will be different for everyone.

Many limit the number because applications are accompanied by a fee. . Step2: Splitting The List Into Target, Reach and Safety Schools In general, students will want to apply to three types of schools: Target, Reach and Safety schools. It is up to you how many applications you send, but a good mix would be more target than reach, and at least one safety. You will need to take your list, and now decide which are your top picks, which are attainable for you academically, which are affordable for you only with aid, and refine your broad list into a group of schools that gives you the best chance for success.

It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - Ebla ( Arabic : , modern : , Tell Mardikh ) , was one of the earliest kingdoms in Syria . Its remains constitute a tell located about 55 km ( 34 mi ) southwest of Aleppo near the village of Mardikh . Ebla was an important center throughout the third millennium BC and in the first half of the second millennium BC.

Karl Moore described the first Eblaite kingdom as the first recorded world power . Starting as a small settlement in the early Bronze Age ( c. 3500 BC ) , Ebla developed into a trading empire and later into an expansionist power that imposed its hegemony over much of northern and eastern Syria . Its language , Eblaite , is now considered the earliest attested Semitic language after Akkadian .

The plan is likely to see most of the black seats currently fixed in the stadium changed to white, with the exception of several hundred black seats that are likely to be rearranged to create the two club crests ahead of the Hammers moving into their new home in 2016. Details of the plan emerged at a stakeholder’s meeting at the club, where the ongoing stadium transformation work was discussed. The West Ham board are looking into options to enable the Hammers to have their colours and badge on seats. The Hammers unveiled this new club badge in the summer to come into use in 2016 for the stadium move. West Ham's home Upton Park displays the club's badge and traditional colours in and outside the ground. For the 2012 Olympic Games the seats were arranged into a black and white Olympic ‘fragment’ pattern, but stadium officials are understood to be open to the change in a bid to make the stadium acceptable for West Ham fans. The West Ham Board are eager to consider every avenue to make the stadium feel like home for fans and it is also understood that the club and stadium chiefs London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) have not ruled out recolouring some or all of the stadium seats to the club’s claret and blue colours. A source close to the stadium confirmed that the option of recolouring the seats remained a possibility, but that talks were ongoing. West Ham owners David Sullivan and David Gold are eager to make their new stadium feel like home for fans. The Olympic Stadium is costing £154m to convert into West Ham's home but could require a further £15m. LLDC have a full approach to sustainability and if they decide that some or all of the black seats wouldn’t be used, there are a number of options available to them including selling or relocating the seats. West Ham confirmed a new club badge over the summer, which will come into use as of 2016.

Not mentioned in plot summary Answer:","output":"Title: The Tale of Rukh - Shadows of Destiny Plot Summary: In the bustling metropolis of Sern, Rukh (played by a renowned actor) is a young and talented detective, working for the Sern City Police Department. He's tenacious, clever, and seemingly invulnerable. He has a loving family, with a wife and a daughter who adore him and motivate him to always give his best. But Rukh has a secret - he is struggling with a debilitating illness that he has kept hidden from his loved ones and colleagues. As he continues to investigate challenging cases, his past starts to unravel, and the film delves deep into the question: How does Rukh die? The movie begins with Rukh assigned to a peculiar case - a series of murders that appear unconnected but hold a cryptic clue: a symbol which, when decoded, foreshadows the victims' fates. As Rukh delves deeper into the case, he becomes fascinated with the mystery. At the same time, his health is beginning to take a turn for the worse. Still, he continues to hide his secret in order not to burden his family or jeopardize his career. Throughout the investigation, Rukh starts sensing that he is being watched, but he can't identify the source of this discomfort. While searching for answers, he stumbles upon Morana, a mysterious and enigmatic woman who tells him that the symbol is tied to an ancient doomsday prophecy. Drawn to Morana's charisma, Rukh becomes persuaded that the killings are part of an elaborate ritual meant to fulfill this prophecy. However, further in the movie, it is revealed that Morana is responsible for the killings and that she has a personal vendetta against Rukh. She unveils a dark, shared history between them - Rukh's very sustenance: the curse that has blessed him with his prodigious talents is sapping away his life force as an act of cosmic balance. As Rukh races against time to stop Morana and save his loved ones, he comes to terms with the fact that his imminent death looms large. He faces a moral dilemma: should he pass on the curse to Morana, consequently saving his life but condemning her to a life of suffering? With this newfound knowledge, Rukh confides in his family about his condition and tears, regrets, and love from them unfurl. The climax of the movie sees an epic showdown between Rukh and Morana. In a heartfelt moment, Rukh decides to accept his impending death, choosing to preserve his morals and using his last few days to solve the case and protect his city. He orchestrates an elaborate plan, relying on the help of his detectives and family, and successfully stops Morana from completing her dark rituals and bringing an unforeseen catastrophe upon the city. When the prophecy's deadline finally arrives, Rukh's suffering worsens, and he is admitted to the hospital. Surrounded by his family and colleagues, he takes his last breath with pride, knowing he has done everything in his power to make the world a better place for his loved ones. In the end, as the film fades to black, Rukh's death serves as a poignant reminder that even the mightiest are mortal, and the true test of character is how we react when faced with the ultimate challenge: our own impending demise. The Tale of Rukh becomes a lesson in humility, courage, and selfless sacrifice, creating a truly unforgettable cinematic experience."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Both Alabama and Florida boast great wetlands. The State of Alabama has experienced extensive drainage system due to expansion of farmlands. Their neighboring state Florida had similar system. But recently Florida had dismantled many of their drainage systems, mostly because of pressure from different environmental groups. But I can use this background: Ecologically, the expansion of drainage systems has had tremendous negative effects. Hundreds of thousands of wetland species experienced significant population declines as their habitat was increasingly fragmented and destroyed. Although market hunting within the Central Flyway was a contributing factor in the decline of many waterfowl species' numbers in the early decades of the twentieth century, loss of breeding habitat to agricultural expansion is certainly the most significant. Early maps of midwestern states depict many lakes and marshes that are either nonexistent or significantly reduced in area today. Channelization, a related process of concentrating and facilitating the flow of water from agricultural areas, also contributed to this degradation. What is an answer for this question: Would Alabama have stable or declining waterfowl species? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, it appears that the expansion of drainage systems has had a significant negative impact on wetland habitats and the species that rely on them. Since Alabama has experienced extensive drainage system expansion due to the growth of farmlands, it is likely that Alabama would have declining waterfowl species. The reasoning behind this answer can be broken down into the following steps: 1. As mentioned in the background, the expansion of drainage systems has led to the fragmentation and destruction of wetland habitats. This has caused population declines for hundreds of thousands of wetland species. 2. The loss of breeding habitat due to agricultural expansion is considered the most significant factor in the decline of waterfowl species' numbers, as early maps of midwestern states depict many lakes and marshes that are either nonexistent or significantly reduced in area today. 3. The process of channelization, which concentrates and facilitates the flow of water from agricultural areas, has also contributed to this degradation. 4. Since Alabama has experienced extensive expansion of drainage systems and the resulting degradation of wetland habitats, it is likely that the waterfowl species in the state would be negatively impacted and face a decline in population. In conclusion, based on the provided information, it can be inferred that Alabama would have declining waterfowl species due to the negative impact of drainage system expansion and loss of wetland habitats."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about the following things: book, story, tell","output":"A book is like a friend with many pages that has a story, which is a fun adventure, and we can tell this adventure to others by reading it out loud."},{"instruction":"The old Nahant Life Saving Station ( NLSS ) on the Nahant Road and the new war memorial across from the NLSS were renovated in 2004 .

Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity.... Answer:","output":"The title of the song whose central riff is in NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal) fashion is \\"Phantom Lord.\\""},{"instruction":"Possible review types: pick from the following.

Think slowly and carefully, before giving your answer.","output":"Yes, Hatshepsut would be considered a monarch. Hatshepsut was a female pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, and she reigned from around 1478-1458 BC. She is one of the most famous and successful female rulers in ancient Egyptian history and is considered a monarch because she held the highest position of power and authority in her kingdom. At the beginning of her reign, Hatshepsut held the title of \\"queen\\" as she acted as a regent for her stepson, Thutmose III, who was still a child at the time. Over time, she took on more power and eventually assumed the full title and role of pharaoh. That included wearing the traditional pharaonic headgear and ceremonial beard. Hatshepsut's reign was marked by many accomplishments, including expanding trade networks, commissioning numerous building projects, and overseeing a period of relative peace in ancient Egypt. Among her notable achievements were the construction of the impressive mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri and the restoration of many other temples neglected during the rule of the Hyksos. In conclusion, Hatshepsut is rightfully considered a monarch, as she wielded unquestionable power and authority during her reign as pharaoh, and significantly contributed to the growth and prosperity of ancient Egypt."},{"instruction":"Translate the following.

Hy-Vee is pulling ground beef with the \\"lean finely textured trimmings,\\" also referred to pejoratively as pink slime, from its shelves. The beef additive is made from scraps at slaughterhouses. Comer said industry guesses on hamburger price increases range from 3 cents per pound to 25 cents per pound. Hamburger prices already have risen by 70 cents per pound, about 25 percent, in the 24 months since February 2010 because of tight U.S. cattle supplies. Beef Products Inc. of Dakota Dunes, S.D., said it was closing three of its four plants, including a plant in Waterloo that employs about 220 workers, at least temporarily, after a pink slime firestorm erupted on social media. In Waterloo, the BPI workers were told that they would continue to receive pay and benefits for 60 days, and that it was unclear when the plant would reopen. BPI also shuttered plants in Garden City, Kan., and Amarillo, Texas. Product has been in stores since '90s Although there have been no reported cases of illness or disease traced to the trimmings, a collective revulsion factor fed by postings on Facebook, YouTube and an ABC News series prompted the widespread halt in use of the product, which has been on supermarket meat counters since the early 1990s. \\"It's crazy,\\" said Des Moines meat wholesaler Phil Barber of Brewer Meats, which he said has not knowingly used meat with the filler. Barber nonetheless said of the trimmings, \\"They're free of E. coli, and they're 95 percent fat free.\\" Futures prices for slaughter-ready cattle and younger feeder cattle both rose almost 1 percent Tuesday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The higher cattle prices followed several days of pullbacks from record levels, as traders and retailers worried that high beef prices would erode consumer demand ahead of the summer grilling season. \\"There had been a pullback in prices, but the news about the beef trimmings probably is bullish for cattle in the long run,\\" said commodity trader Jeff French of Top Third Ag Marketing in Chicago. Commodity trader Dennis Smith of Archer Financial Services in Chicago suggested that the cutback in the use of the trimmings will make beef supplies even tighter, and added that consumers' revulsion may hit their pocketbooks. \\"Long term, the refusal by consumers to use this product (lean finely textured beef) will make less beef available and force prices higher. If that's what the consumer wants, that's what they'll get,\\" Smith said. BPI purchases the trimmings and makes them into a filler that constitutes up to 15 percent of total volume in ground beef products. The process has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since the early 1990s and scarcely raised an eyebrow until last week, when social media comments went viral over its depiction as pink slime. Term was coined by USDA scientist The name pink slime originally came from a former USDA microbiologist, Gerald Zirnstein, but it has taken off because of postings by Food Network chef Jamie Oliver and others. Meanwhile, ABC News ran a series of reports this month that widely disseminated the pink slime moniker. \\"While lean finely textured beef was given a catchy and clever nickname in 'pink slime,' the impact of alarming broadcasts about this safe and wholesome beef product by Jamie Oliver, ABC News and others are no joke to those families that are now out of work,\\" American Meat Institute President J. Patrick Boyle said in a statement. \\"This shows the impact of the social media,\\" said Kevin Concannon, former director of the Iowa Department of Human Services and now undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at the USDA. \\"There is absolutely no evidence that this product is unsafe, and it is low fat.\\" Concannon's office last week told the nation's schools that if they wished to stop using beef with the additive, they were free to do so. Those schools joined most of the nation's major supermarket and hamburger chains in dumping the product. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1. The end of using the \\"pink slime\\" beef additive will likely increase hamburger prices due to the equivalent loss of 1.5 million head of cattle. 2. Hy-Vee is one of the supermarket chains removing ground beef with the additive from their shelves. 3. Beef Products Inc. is closing three of its four plants after the \\"pink slime\\" controversy erupted on social media. 4.

Lord Lytton wrote in 1853 that On the common some young men were playing at hockey. That old-fashioned game, now very uncommon in England, except at schools ... Hockey's popularity increased with that of other team games. A version of the game played in south-east London was rougher than the modern version, played on a very large field (247m by 64m), and used a cube of black rubber and rough planed sticks. The modern game was developed on the other side of London by Middlesex cricket clubs, especially Teddington Hockey Club. The members of these clubs were looking for winter exercise, but did not particularly care for football. In 1870, members of the Teddington cricket club, who had recently moved to play in Bushy Park, were looking for a winter activity. They experimented with a' stick' game, based loosely on the rules of association football. Teddington played the game on the smooth outfield of their cricket pitch and used a cricket ball, so allowing smooth and predictable motion. By 1874 they had begun to draw up rules for their game, including banning the raising of the stick above shoulder height and stipulating that a shot at goal must take place within the circle in front of it. An association was formed in 1875, which dissolved after seven years, but in 1886 the Hockey Association was formed by seven London clubs and representatives from Trinity College, Cambridge. Blackheath were one of the founder members, but refused to accept the rules drawn up by the other clubs and left to found the National Hockey Union. The Union failed, but the Association grew rapidly. Answer this question: where is first hockey club set up in world? Let's give stream of consciousness first:","output":"The first hockey club in the world was set up in Blackheath, London. It was established in the 1860s by members of the Blackheath Cricket, Football, and Lawn Tennis clubs who were looking for a winter sport to play. However, the modern version of field hockey as we know it today mainly originated from Teddington Hockey Club, which was formed in London in 1871. The members of Teddington Hockey Club introduced several important rules to the game, such as the prohibition of raising the stick above shoulder height and the requirement that a shot at goal must occur within the circle in front of it. The growth and development of the game continued with the formation of the Hockey Association in 1886 by seven London clubs, including Blackheath, and representatives from Trinity College, Cambridge."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence or phrase in English.

Step 2: Cook the chicken Place the chicken in a saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil. Then, lower the heat and let it simmer for 20-25 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked. This step will ensure the chicken is tender and safe for your baby to consume. Step 3: Prepare the fruits or vegetables While the chicken is cooking, wash and chop the fruits or vegetables of your choice into small pieces. Make sure to remove any seeds or inedible parts. This step is important to make it easier to blend the ingredients later. Step 4: Steam the fruits or vegetables Place the chopped fruits or vegetables in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water. Steam them for 5-10 minutes, or until they are soft and easily mashed with a fork. Steaming helps to retain the nutrients and make them easier for the baby to digest.

Blend until the mixture reaches a smooth puree-like consistency, adding a small amount of water or cooking liquid if needed to achieve the desired texture.

The controversial photographer who died in 1989 at the age of just 42, after a fight with Aids, was dashing, dark and dangerous. He imagines himself as some kind of sinister screen idol – James Dean reinvented by David Lynch – in a self-portrait out of which he gazes with sexually charged insolence, macho in black leather jacket and slicked hair, cigarette hanging from his lips, a dark star from Hollywood’s nightmares. Now he is to hit the big screen posthumously in both a documentary and a biopic. Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures has just shown at Sundance, and while this factual examination of his art and life is gathering acclaim, it has also emerged that Matt Smith – yes, him, the Eleventh Doctor – is to play Mapplethorpe in a film currently titled simply Mapplethorpe. Smith played the Doctor as a bow-tied embodiment of geekiness who insisted “bow ties are cool.” As Mapplethorpe, will he state a preference for bullwhips ? He can certainly do the hair. In fact, it seems great casting. But the fascinating thing here is how an artist’s life story – and the way it is told – can shape art history. In his lifetime, Robert Mapplethorpe was highly contentious, and not just because of the provocative content of some of his art. His photographs of the male nude and of gay sadomasochist subculture saw him attacked by the American right, with Senator Jesse Helms denouncing his art in Congress. Yet he also divided critics whose own views were impeccably liberal. Was he a serious artist or a sub-Warholian celebrity of shock? Mapplethorpe was one of the 1980s New York artists (Basquiat another) who flirted with pop culture and set out to be “art stars”. Serious critics disdained Mapplethorpe. Robert Hughes in particular scorned “the mannered, postmodern chic of his images” and labelled him a “small talent.” And yet, as Mapplethorpe fades into history he grows in stature. This is partly to do with storytelling and memory. When the Italian artist and writer Giorgio Vasari invented art history in 1550, he did it by telling racy life stories. His sensational masterpiece The Lives of the Artists is still enjoyed today as a collection of biographies; only very dedicated readers discover it has an underlying theoretical argument. Vasari’s insight that to get his friends remembered, he must make their lives exciting, is still true. And by and large it is the artists whose lives would (and often do) make a good film who are remembered. The sufferings of Frida Kahlo and Vincent van Gogh have made them far more famous than artists who just taught at art school or worked steadily for 60 years (the genius of Mike Leigh’s recent film Mr Turner was to break this rule by telling the story of an artist whose life was not really very cinematic at all). Mapplethorpe had a life to make Vasari weep – with compassion, but also with joy at its sheer narrative gold. The all-American kid who sets out to find fame and fortune in late 1960s New York, falls in love with a brilliant young poetess, then discovers he is gay; who lives with her anyway at the Chelsea Hotel as they both explore their different creative passions. He finally becomes a glamorous “art star” drawn to dark erotic themes while she evolves from Rimbaud-reading bookshop clerk to the goddess of punk. He also has his Vasari. Mapplethorpe’s lifelong friend was, of course, that self-same poetess, Patti Smith, and her 2010 book Just Kids is one of the most beautiful memoirs of an artist ever written. It is very hard to look at Mapplethorpe coldly if you have read her tender – yet not uncritical – perceptions of him. He comes across intensely as someone who loved art, who was driven to do art. No saint, but some kind of martyr. Just Kids tells Mapplethorpe’s story with a candid elegance that matches many of the best American novels – its best parts have the finesse of Truman Capote. It is surely a book that will last, and with it Mapplethorpe must last, too. Smith has achieved with her words what Shakespeare promised his lover in Sonnet 18: “So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see / So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.” The only thing that surprises me, given the romantic eloquence of Just Kids, is that it has taken six years for someone to put together a biopic. Or perhaps it is no surprise. Mapplethorpe is not exactly family entertainment and the film in which Matt Smith will star is not big budget Hollywood production stuff. His story and his art still have a whiff of danger. That, of course, is the fascination. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Robert Mapplethorpe, the controversial photographer, is set to hit the big screen posthumously in both a documentary and biopic, having a significant impact on art history as the stories of his life - and the way they are told - can shape people's perception of him as an artist.

First, let's combine all the terms with \\"t\\" in them: -27*t + 124*t + 111*t. Think of it like this: you have -27 apples, then you get 124 apples, and then you get 111 more apples. 2. Now let's add them up: -27 + 124 + 111 = 208. 3. So now our math problem is 208*t - 2080 = 0 (you have 208 apples and you want to find how many 't' you need to remove 2080 apples). 4. We need to solve this equation for 't'. To do that, we'll add 2080 to both sides of the equation: 208*t = 2080. 5. Now we need to find out how many times 208 goes into 2080. We do this by dividing: 2080 ÷ 208 = 10. 6. So, the answer is t = 10. That means, you need to remove 10 times of 208 apples to have 0 apples left."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Hello!

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If plants die in soft mud more often, it would lead to a higher accumulation of organic materials in the sediment. This increased amount of organic material could potentially cause the remains to decompose at a faster rate due to increased microbial activity breaking down the organic matter. However, it could also lead to a higher rate of fossil formation due to a larger quantity of remains being preserved in the sediment. As for the second effect mentioned, which is the sediment building up over the remains, the increased frequency of plants dying in soft mud may lead to a more rapid accumulation of sediment. This could potentially have a \\"more\\" effect on the sedimentation rate, as more organic material would contribute to the volume of sediment that builds up over the remains. At the same time, it is essential to consider that several factors influence sedimentation and decomposition processes, such as the specific ecosystem, temperature, water/oxygen availability, and the presence of predators or decomposers. Ultimately, the increased rate of plants dying in soft mud would likely have a more significant effect on both the remains' decomposition and sediment buildup over the remains.

Shiva also founded a production studio called Gidalya Pictures. Can we infer the following? Alexandra Elizabeth Shiva is of Indian descent","output":"From the information provided, it is not entirely accurate to infer that Alexandra Elizabeth Shiva is of Indian descent. Her professional background and achievements as an American film producer and director are clear, with notable accomplishments like her award-winning film \\"Bombay Eunuch\\" (2001) and the documentary \\"How to Dance in Ohio\\" (2015) which was showcased at the Sundance Film Festival. The formation of her production studio, Gidalya Pictures, further highlights her thriving career in the film industry. However, this information does not necessarily serve as a confirmation of her ethnic or ancestral background. While the title of one of her films, \\"Bombay Eunuch,\\" may suggest a connection to Indian culture, it could also be a result of her artistic interest or passion for exploring diverse societies and narratives through her work. To accurately determine Alexandra Elizabeth Shiva's descent, one would have to examine more personal information, such as her family history, parents, family tree, or any definitive records that reveal her lineage or relationships within the Indian community. This would provide a more reliable basis for asserting her heritage, as opposed to basing the conclusion on the subjects she has explored in her films. In summary, without further information about Alexandra Elizabeth Shiva's personal and family background, we cannot definitively infer that she is of Indian descent.

The second and third puzzles have the same number of pieces. 4. Each of the second and third puzzles has 50% more pieces than the first puzzle. Now let's calculate the number of pieces for the second and third puzzles: Since the first puzzle has 1000 pieces and the second and third puzzles have 50% more pieces than the first puzzle, we'll calculate how much 50% of 1000 is: 50% of 1000 = (50/100) * 1000 = 500 Now we can calculate the number of pieces in the second and third puzzles: Number of pieces in the second and third puzzles (each) = number of pieces in the first puzzle + 50% more pieces = 1000 + 500 = 1500 Now that we know the number of pieces in each puzzle, let's add them up to find the total number of pieces: Total number of pieces = pieces in the first puzzle + pieces in the second puzzle + pieces in the third puzzle = 1000 + 1500 + 1500 = 4000 So, the total number of pieces in all the three puzzles John bought is 4000."},{"instruction":"Two of the members, Bulgaria and Romania, will be leaving the organisation once they join the EU.

Office Jenny's actions in the scenario paint the picture of a professional setting. The responsibilities she handles, such as answering the phone, taking messages, and handling information about significant projects, typically point towards a job role that involves administrative or secretarial duties. These duties are commonly undertaken in an office environment. Option A, a friend's house, likely would not provide an appropriate setting for managing such professional tasks, especially those involving the transmission of critical information about a major project. Option B, a hotel, unless specified, generally isn't the default setting for such work, unless Jenny is traveling for work and her hotel room has been temporarily transformed into a mobile office. However, the information given does not suggest this. Option C, a school, is a possible place for work or a job setting, but it usually involves a different set of tasks related to education, teaching, or academic administration. The duties of answering generic work calls and managing project-related information typically don't fall under common school-related responsibilities. Jenny's actions don't align with the usual tasks seen in this environment. Option D, a party, arguably is an even less likely setting. It's a place usually designated for leisure, recreation, or celebration, not carrying out professional work-related tasks.

Donald Duck is doing some camouflage painting on a cannon with yellow, green, and red stripes and black dots (based on the colors of the Flag of Lithuania with bullet holes in it). Sergeant Pete sees it and scolds Donald, explaining that it needs to painted so it can't be seen. Pete then demands that Donald re-paint the cannon to make it \\"hard to see\\". Obliging to the sergeant's orders, Donald walks to the \\"Experimental Laboratory: Camouflage Corps\\", disregarding the 'keep out' sign, and walks in. He finds some \\"invisible paint\\", which he tests with his finger, and uses it to paint the cannon. When Pete returns, he is shocked to find the cannon seemingly gone, believing it to be stolen. But of course it isn't stolen, as the sergeant finds out the hard way by bonking his head on the underside of the cannon and discovering Donald inside. Angered that Donald painted the cannon too invisible to see, Pete blows hard into one end of the barrel, sending Donald out the other end and into the bucket of invisible paint. When Donald runs away, Pete finds out Donald has become invisible after seeing Donald's footprints on the ground. Donald then swims across a lake, but the invisible paint doesn't come off.

Pete spots Donald and tries to catch him, but he gets away again. However, this gives Pete an idea to find Donald.

The secretary/music director for the church, Anne (Susan Clark), is wary of the changes Hill intends to implement. Hill wants to get people involved, and asks the elderly Mrs. Rose Rafferty (Patsy Kelly) to handle the church's sinking fund.On his first Sunday, Hill learns from Mrs. Rafferty that her gambling husband Delaney (Douglas Fowley) bet all the sinking fund money on a horse race. Hill delivers a sermon less than 15 seconds long, then rapidly escorts Mrs. Rafferty out the church as astonished worshipers watch. She leads him to the bookie, hidden behind a dry-cleaning shop, and meets Harry the Hat (Alan Hale, Jr.), who recommends that Hill let the bet ride. Hill's horse loses and he is thrown out of the betting parlor. Hill summons the police, but the booking joint has been skillfully removed.That evening, Hill delivers a tirade against the organized crime in the city during a local television broadcast. He is chastised by his presbytery superiors for the tirade, and is urged to go out and build church membership in the area. His only success is with a rock band called Strawberry Shortcake, who he recruits to \\"jazz up\\" the music at church.

Article: There is a Web site called the \\"World Database of Happiness.\\" It combines and analyzes the results of hundreds of surveys from around the world that have been conducted on life satisfaction. Most of the findings are predictable, but a few are surprising. The database makes it clear that there is not a strong connection between material wealth and general contentment. It is a cliche to say that money can't buy happiness, but the old saying seems to be supported by research. Many people still cling to the belief that gaining riches will be the answer to all their problems, yet they are probably mistaken. Studies have been carried out on people who acquired sudden wealth, such as lottery winners. In most cases, after the initial joy had worn off, people were not left with a sense of lasting happiness. In fact, they tended to revert to the way they felt before they became rich. Previously contented people continue to be contented, while those who were miserable before sink back into misery. If material wealth does not bring happiness, then what does? Perhaps happiness has something to do with where you live. The authorities at the World Database on Happiness have surveyed levels of happiness in different countries. Apparently, people in America, Canada, and Singapore are very happy; people living in India and Russia, not surprisingly, are not happy. Other surveys consistently point to the importance of relationships. Family relationships in particular seem to be the key to long-term contentment. The Web site suggests that falling in love and having children are two of the situations that bring the greatest happiness. Nowadays people look to technology as an alternative source of satisfaction. People increasingly spend more time alone watching TV or surfing the Internet rather than spending time with family. Can technology truly make people happy? It is too difficult to tell, but one thing is sure: If the Web site's research is accurate, time spent with your family is a better investment than time spent making money. Question: Which description is right according to the passage? Options: A: The material wealth and general contentment are strongly connected with each other. B: The more one's wealth is, the happier he will be. C: Many people have wrong concept towards the relation between love and money. D: Money can solve all the problems.

In the town of Glipforg, Lem is a teenager with a new part-time job at the local planetarium and a long-time crush on his neighbor, Neera. His best friend is Skiff, a big fan of the Humaniacs films. Lem tries to ask Neera on a date, but her hippie friend, Glar, keeps interrupting with his protest songs. A mysterious spacecraft goes into orbit around Planet 51 and sends out a signal. On Planet 51, under a secret Army installation called Base 9 (their version of Area 51), there is a basement filled with Earth artifacts including robotic satellites launched by the United States and the Soviet Union. The spacecraft's signal activates Rover, a wheeled A.I. probe. Rover escapes, following a program to locate the newly arrived astronaut.

They also argue that he wanted a war to resolve growing domestic political problems. Other historians, notably French historian Pierre Milza, dispute this. On 8 May 1870, shortly before the war, French voters had overwhelmingly supported Napoleon III's program in a national plebiscite, with 7,358,000 votes yes against 1,582,000 votes no, an increase of support of two million votes since the legislative elections in 1869. According to Milza, the Emperor had no need for a war to increase his popularity. Who proposed that Emperor needed no war to increase his public appeal?","output":"The proposal that Emperor Napoleon III did not need to engage in war to bolster his public appeal was made by French historian Pierre Milza. This perspective of Milza is based on the fact that Napoleon III enjoyed significant support from the French public right before the Franco-Prussian War. This is evidenced by the results of a national plebiscite conducted on May 8, 1870, in which the French voters overwhelmingly favored Napoleon III's program. Approximately 7,358,000 voted yes, in stark contrast to the 1,582,000 who objected. Furthermore, these results indicated an increase of two million votes in Napoleon's favor since the legislative elections that took place in 1869. These figures, Milza argues, illustrate that Napoleon III already had considerable public support, thus undermining the proposition that he instigated war with Prussia primarily for the purpose of strengthening his position domestically. This deviates from the view held by some historians who assert that in addition to his diplomatic failures - notably from the 1866 Austro-Prussian War - Napoleon III was motivated to initiate the Franco-Prussian War due to escalating political issues at home, believing a military victory would be an effective solution. In essence, Pierre Milza's stance is that the lead-up to the Franco-Prussian War cannot be simplified as an attempt by Napoleon III to resolve domestic problems or increase his popularity through means of warfare. He purports that the Emperor was not compelled to this course of action, as his political standing — as evidenced by the clear mandate from the 1870 national plebiscite — was already firmly established and commanding. Hence, according to Milza, the theory that Napoleon III sought war as a means to bolster his public appeal does not hold true."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Thryptomene calycina commonly known as Grampians Thryptomene is a shrub species in the family Myrtaceae.

Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\". In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\"., can you guess it ?

This statement clearly shows the reviewer's unfavorable opinion of the film, implying that the movie is of poor quality and that efforts have been made to hide its flaws.

Moreover, the use of the possessive pronoun \\"his\\" in \\"his movie\\" can either refer to the director, writer, or producer, depending on the context of the full review.

Excited to be Jan's hero for finding her wallet; Answer:","output":"Jordan most likely feels excited to be Jan's hero for finding and returning her wallet. In this context, Jordan has managed to locate something that was extremely important to Jan, as it contains her identification, money, and other essentials. Not only does this make Jordan feel good about themselves for being able to help another person, but it also strengthens the bond between Jan and Jordan. By playing a crucial role in navigating Jan through a difficult situation, Jordan is likely to experience a sense of accomplishment and pride. Furthermore, since humans tend to be empathetic creatures, Jordan could feel a sense of relief on behalf of Jan. He likely knows that misplacing a wallet can lead to feelings of panic, anxiety, and frustration. By finding and returning it, Jordan not only mitigates these negative emotions for Jan but also gains a sense of contentment from his actions. This empathetic response further solidifies the positive emotional impact of Jordan's actions. In addition, being able to assist Jan in her time of need can boost Jordan's self-esteem as well. He has demonstrated that he can be resourceful and dependable, which can enhance his self-worth. As a result, Jordan may cultivate a stronger sense of self-identity and self-efficacy, fostering a higher degree of self-respect. Another possible aspect of Jordan's excitement could stem from the gratitude he may receive from Jan. It feels good to be acknowledged and appreciated for our actions, and Jan's grateful response could further reinforce Jordan's positive emotions. This gratification is a powerful motivator for people to continue doing good deeds, as it rewards our brains with a sense of fulfillment and happiness. In summary, Jordan is likely to experience excitement at being Jan's hero for finding her wallet. He could feel a range of positive emotions, such as pride, relief, self-worth, and happiness due to his actions – in turn, strengthening the connection between them and enhancing his sense of self."},{"instruction":"Add spaces between the words in the following text: MainimagebelongstoMichaelWristonlicensedundertheseterms.Thetextdescriptionisextractedfromwikipedia(Sudoku)andlicensedundertheGFDL.","output":"Main image belongs to Michael Wriston licensed under these terms.

Color is one of the most important aspects of your dress, and if you pick accessories that are similarly colored to your dress, it will make your outfit look balanced and well put together. If you are wearing a light pink dress, choose pink or rose-colored accessories to go along with it. Matching doesn’t have to be exact. For example, you can still wear dark pink shoes with a light pink dress. This adds some funkiness to your matching. Instead of matching your accessories to the overall color of the dress, match them to a secondary color in your dress. This works especially well with patterned dresses, because there is more than one color you can match with. If you are wearing a white dress with pink and blue flowers, wear pink or blue accessories. This is a great way to match with your dress in a more nuanced way. If your dress is an extremely bright color like bright yellow, wear neutrals to offset it. If you match your accessories directly with your brightly colored dress, you may look eccentric rather than put together. White, black, tan and brown are all neutrals that look good with almost any color. If you prefer some bling, try gold or silver jewelry instead. A patterned dress already has a lot going on. If you throw in accessories that are patterned or intricate, the look becomes too much. Your shoes, bag, belt, and/or jewelry should all be solid-colored. These accessories will help your dress make its statement. Try bright, red pumps with a blue-and-while polka dotted dress. If your dress has a floral pattern on it, a pair of simple, stud earrings would look especially cute. Pair it with black or leather flats to complete the look. If your dress is a neutral color like white, beige or tan, adding a bright accessory gives your outfit oomph. Whether it be a statement necklace, a handbag or your shoes, try to make one of your accessories a bright color. If your dress is a solid color, try wearing a patterned handbag or shoes. For example, you could wear a polka dotted bag with a white dress. Every color has a tone. Red, orange, and yellow all have a warm tone. Green, blue and purple are all cool toned. Similarly, gold has a warm tone to it while silver has a cool tone. Don't be afraid to experiment, however; gold can look quite striking with green. White and black are considered neutral tones, so you can wear gold or silver jewelry with them. Brown and tan come in cool and warm undertones. In this case, match the jewelry to the undertone.","output":"Accessories can make your outfit look nicer. If you have a dress with colors, like pink, use accessories that have the same color, like pink shoes or bags. You can also use a different shade of the color, like a dark pink. If your dress has many colors, like a white dress with pink and blue flowers, use pink or blue accessories. If your dress is really bright, like yellow, use simple colors like white, black, or brown for your accessories. If your dress has a pattern, like polka dots or flowers, use plain accessories. If your dress has no colors or patterns, add a colorful accessory, like a necklace, bag, or shoes. You can also try a patterned accessory if your dress is all one color. Remember, red, orange, and yellow have warm tones, while green, blue, and purple have cool tones. Gold and silver jewelry can go with many colors.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Jarboe contributed to Swan's Greed album\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can conclude that Jarboe contributed to Swans' Greed album. The paragraph explicitly states that Greed is the first Swans album to contain contributions from Jarboe. As a result, we can deduce that Jarboe played a role in shaping the album's sound or content. The mention of Greed marking a turning point for the band away from their previous noise rock style suggests that Jarboe's involvement may have contributed to this shift. By joining the band for this third studio album, Jarboe may have brought new influences and perspectives that helped Swans evolve their sound. In 1986, Swans released Greed through the record label K.422, adding to their discography of experimental rock music. As this album marked a transition in the band's musical direction and introduced Jarboe's contributions, it likely holds a unique significance in the band's history. To summarize, the paragraph indicates that Jarboe contributed to Swans' Greed album, which was released in 1986 and is notable for marking a shift in the band's musical style.

He becomes just the second person to be convicted by the court since it was set up in The Hague in 2002. He would have been the first convicted of sexual crimes. Katanga, who was transferred to The Hague by the Congolese authorities in 2007, had denied the charges. The fighting in Ituri, which broke out in 1999 and continued until 2003, started as a struggle for control of land and resources. But it escalated into an inter-ethnic conflict, exacerbated by the presence of Uganda troops, that killed an estimated 50,000 people. Q&A: International Criminal Court Will Africa pull out of the ICC? Will trials bring peace to Ituri? Katanga was convicted of being an accessory to an attack on Bogoro that took place on 24 February 2003, killing more than 200 people. In a majority verdict, the judges said he had helped plan the attack, and procure the weapons used, but they acquitted him of direct involvement. He was also cleared of using child soldiers. In total, he was convicted of being an accessory to four counts of war crimes and one crime against humanity. He will be sentenced at a future hearing. ICC prosecutors at The Hague say the assault was designed to \\"wipe out\\" the entire strategically important village, which is close to the Ugandan border. According to the prosecution, the attack happened early in the morning and some villagers were shot while they slept, while others were cut up with machetes to save bullets. Without the \\"supply of weapons... commanders would not have been able to carry out the attack with such efficiency,\\" said presiding judge Bruno Cotte. At the time Katanga was 24 years old and the alleged commander of the Patriotic Resistance Force of Ituri (FRPI), which had the support of the Lendu ethnic group. The prosecution said that as the FRPI's leader, he was to blame for the atrocities committed by his fighters against the villagers from the Hema ethnic group. The judges found that women who survived the massacre had been raped or kept as sex slaves but they did not find enough evidence to convict Katanga of carrying out these crimes. Another person was charged by the ICC in connection with the Bogoro attack. But in December 2012 Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui was acquitted as judges found there was insufficient evidence to show that he was the commander of National Integrationist Front (FNI), which also took part in the raid. The BBC's Maud Jullien in DR Congo says Katanga was known to his men as \\"Simba\\", meaning lion. Those who knew him describe him as a discreet man but ruthless on the battlefield, she says. After the end of the Ituri conflict, peace deals were signed and Katanga was given a position in the Congolese army. But a year after joining the military he was imprisoned for bad behaviour and was still in prison when the ICC issued its arrest warrant for him. His is one of the longest-running cases at the ICC. In July 2012, Thomas Lubanga, a rival militia leader in Ituri, was sentenced to 14 years in jail by the ICC for recruiting and using child soldiers.","output":"Germain Katanga was found guilty of complicity in the 2003 massacre in the Ituri province of north-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, resulting in a conviction by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. This marked only the second conviction by the ICC since its foundation in 2002. Katanga was charged with planning and providing weapons for the attack on the village of Bogoro on February 24, 2003, which led to the deaths of over 200 people. He was acquitted of direct involvement in the attack and of using child soldiers.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"You'd better not try that dish if you can't tolerate rock music\\" - Sentence B: \\"You'd better not try that dish if you can't tolerate chili food\\" Let me think hard. Detailed solution:","output":"Sentence A: \\"You'd better not try that dish if you can't tolerate rock music\\" does not make sense. Detailed solution: In both sentences, the speaker is giving advice about whether or not to try a particular dish. The deciding factor in each sentence is the listener's ability or preference for \\"tolerating\\" something. In Sentence A, the deciding factor is the listener's ability to tolerate rock music. This sentence does not make sense because there is no logical connection between a person's tolerance for rock music and their preference for a certain type of food. The two factors are unrelated, and it is unclear how a dish could be influenced by someone's preference for rock music. In Sentence B, the deciding factor is the listener's ability to tolerate chili food. This sentence makes sense because there is a logical connection between a person's tolerance for spicy food and their preference for a dish containing chili. A dish that is spicy or incorporates chili as an ingredient can be less enjoyable for someone who is sensitive to or dislikes spicy food. Thus, it makes sense to advise someone who cannot tolerate chili food to avoid the dish in question. So, Sentence A does not make sense, while Sentence B does."},{"instruction":"At most three girls saw anything. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"The linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"At most three girls saw anything\\" can be analyzed through various dimensions including semantics, syntax, grammar, and pragmatics. I will examine each of these aspects in order to provide a comprehensive analysis. 1. Semantics: Semantics deals with the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. In this sentence, the meaning is relatively clear - the maximum number of girls who saw something (anything) is three. The sentence does an effective job of conveying this information. The phrase \\"at most\\" functions as a quantifier, constraining the number of girls, while \\"anything\\" serves as a referent for unspecified events or objects that might have been seen. 2. Syntax: Syntax is the study of how words are combined to create well-formed sentences. The given sentence demonstrates proper syntactic construction, with a clear structure that is easily understandable. The sentence can be broken down into a noun phrase (NP): \\"At most three girls\\" and a verb phrase (VP): \\"saw anything.\\" The phrase \\"At most three girls\\" works as the subject of the sentence, while \\"saw anything\\" acts as the predicate, indicating the action or state associated with the subject. 3. Grammar: Grammar pertains to the rules and principles governing the proper construction of sentences. The sentence adheres to standard English grammar rules: a. The subject-verb agreement is correct - the plural noun \\"girls\\" is matched with the plural verb \\"saw.\\" b. The use of preposition \\"at\\" in the phrase \\"at most\\" is suitable here, forming a legitimate quantifier. c. The word order follows the typical Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern found in English sentences. 4. Pragmatics: Pragmatics refers to the way language is used in a specific context, considering factors such as speaker intention, listener understanding, and situational context. Although the semantics, syntax, and grammar of the sentence appear to be sound, whether the sentence is pragmatically appropriate depends on the context in which it is used. a. If this sentence is said in response to a question or within a conversation that hinges upon the topic of 'girls seeing something,' it is pragmatically appropriate. b. If the sentence is used in isolation or within a conversation that has no connection to the topic, it may be considered pragmatically inappropriate or odd. In conclusion, the sentence \\"At most three girls saw anything\\" demonstrates linguistic integrity in terms of semantics, syntax, and grammar. However, whether it is pragmatically appropriate depends on the context in which it is being used. If it is used in a relevant context, the sentence effectively conveys the intended meaning and adheres to standard conventions of the English language."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What type of details about al golden -lrb- american football -rrb- can be gathered from the following bio?

As I became more and more busy, I tried to experiment to find out how I could become more productive and keep up with the workload.

As a founder, I’ve been able to create an office space and a work culture at Ministry of Supply that is flexible, varied and dog-friendly.

Parties interested in the estate should go to the Laurel mansion for the reading of the will. Stan can't remember if Ebeneezer is a relative or not but they decide to go to the mansion anyway. They arrive during a thunderstorm and discover that Ebeneezer had been murdered and that the police had placed the notice in the newspaper to draw all of the relatives together to find out who committed the crime.

Avoid touching it.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Identifying and Managing Red Sores and Blisters: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction: The human body can, at times, present with various signs and symptoms that may indicate an underlying health issue. Among these symptoms are red sores, larger blisters, and issues with the leg area. It is essential to understand how to identify these symptoms, what steps to take upon discovery, and when to seek medical attention. This article will guide you through the process of recognizing, managing, and treating such symptoms to ensure your optimal health and well-being. Step 1: Look for red sores The first step in identifying potential skin issues is to examine your body for the presence of red sores. Red sores can manifest in many forms, such as small, fluid-filled blisters or larger, open lesions. The appearance of these sores could indicate various skin conditions, including infections, allergies, or irritations. Familiarizing yourself with the general appearance of red sores can help you take the appropriate measures to manage and treat them. Step 2: Look on the body for larger blisters In addition to red sores, some individuals may develop larger blisters on their skin. These can result from excessive friction, burns, infections, or immune response. Common locations for blisters include the hands, feet, and other areas subject to pressure or friction. Pay close attention to these areas while examining your skin, as larger blisters may pose a more significant concern and require medical treatment. Step 3: Check the leg area The leg area is another frequent site for skin issues, particularly because it is prone to injury, insect bites, and vein-related problems. Check for the presence of red sores, swelling, or blisters in this region, as these symptoms can indicate conditions ranging from mild, easily treatable issues to potentially serious medical concerns. Step 4: Visit the doctor If you discover any red sores, larger blisters, or other unusual skin symptoms, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and assessment. A doctor can help determine the underlying cause, recommend appropriate treatment options, and ensure that the condition does not worsen. Seeking a professional opinion is always the best course of action in maintaining your health. Step 5: Avoid touching it Once you've identified any concerning skin symptoms, it's vital to avoid touching or popping them, as this can worsen the condition or lead to an infection. Maintain proper hygiene by keeping the affected area clean and dry and applying any prescribed topical treatments or bandages. Conclusion: In conclusion, regularly examining your skin for red sores, larger blisters, and other potential issues is essential for maintaining your overall health. By following these steps and seeking medical advice when needed, you can effectively manage and treat any skin conditions that may arise.

In recent years, the rapid expansion and usage of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have attracted the attention of researchers and professionals in various fields, including psychology. This heightened interest is due to the potential impact that social media could have on mental health among teenagers, who represent a significant user demographic for these platforms. With teenagers spending a significant amount of time online, it is essential to understand how social media usage might affect their psychological well-being. There is a growing body of literature exploring the relationship between social media and mental health, but findings have been mixed, with some studies suggesting that social media usage has a negative effect on mental health, while others report positive or no effects. The discrepancies in these results could possibly be attributed to methodological differences, cultural factors, or other moderating variables that might influence the relationship. Some of the possible mechanisms through which social media could impact mental health among teenagers include social comparison, cyberbullying, fear of missing out (FOMO), and the displacement of face-to-face interactions. Moreover, the amount of time spent on social media and the specific activities conducted on these platforms might also play a role in shaping the levels of well-being experienced by teenagers. Hypothesis: Heavy social media usage exacerbates mental health issues such as anxiety and depression in teenagers. This hypothesis posits that increased engagement with social media platforms might contribute to higher levels of anxiety and depression among teenagers. This effect could be mediated by factors such as social comparison, whereby teenagers constantly compare themselves to others on social media, leading to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Cyberbullying is another potential factor, as negative online interactions could have devastating effects on an individual's mental health. Fear of missing out (FOMO) could also play a role in this relationship, as teenagers might feel compelled to constantly check social media to ensure they do not miss any updates or events. This can create a sense of anxiety and lead to the formation of negative self-images. Finally, the displacement of face-to-face interactions might result in feelings of isolation and weakened social bonds, which can also contribute to poor mental health outcomes. To test this hypothesis, researchers could employ a longitudinal research design to examine changes in mental health over time in a sample of teenagers with varying social media usage patterns. This could be supplemented with qualitative data obtained through interviews or focus groups to gain a more in-depth understanding of the specific elements of social media usage that might contribute to anxiety and depression. By investigating this hypothesis, researchers and mental health professionals could develop a more nuanced understanding of the potential implications of social media usage for teenagers' psychological well-being. This knowledge could then be used to inform policy decisions and interventions aimed at promoting healthier patterns of social media usage and safeguarding the mental health of teenagers in the digital age."},{"instruction":"Upward Bound High School in Hartwick, New York was the first alternative education program in Otsego County, New York.

In my experience, that kind of teen age difference only occurs when the girl is the younger one, since girls mature so much quicker, and are more on the wavelength of boys a few years older. Sorry, but I didn't buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for shock value. The ending was somewhat abrupt and, again, contrived. If the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic, then it fell somewhat short in my eyes. It bugs me that British films only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the poverty-stricken. Don't get me wrong, I love Trainspotting, and Four Weddings has its charms, but can't we Brits come up with anything different? Why are our films always so hung up on the class system? I was born in 1973, so wasn't much different in age to 'Shaun' would've been in 1983. I grew up in a single parent family on a fairly down-trodden council estate in a city in England. However, my childhood experiences were vastly different to those portrayed in the film - I don't even remember racism being an issue (although i'm not saying it didn't exist). 'This is England'? Not in my experience. The bottom line is that I felt this film lacked substance, and I was completely bored and unimpressed throughout.

I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be.

He and his henchmen try to uncover his attackers' identity whilst simultaneously trying not to worry their American visitors, who Harold believes will not go into business with him if they think he's not in full control of his affairs. The situation worsens when a pub in which they are about to have dinner at is blown up and Harold's partner, Victoria, tells the Americans that they are under attack from an unknown enemy. She suspects that Harold's right hand man, Jeff, knows more than he has been letting on about the attacks, while Jeff simultaneously starts to fear that Harold might be onto him and tries to prevent people from talking through intimidation. After some detective work, Harold confronts Jeff, who confesses that he sent Harold's friend Colin on a job to Belfast to deliver money raised by Irish Navvies (construction workers) to the IRA. When Harold discovers Jeff accepted a job to deliver funds to the IRA, he becomes extremely angry and vows to destroy the IRA in London. Jeff advises against this and explains that the IRA aren't just annoyed about some of the money which had gone missing, but also wrongly hold Harold responsible for the murder of three IRA men.

How do you find the empirical formula from a percent composition? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, these two questions are asking about the same information. They both inquire about finding the empirical formula from a given percent composition. To find the empirical formula from a percent composition, you can follow these steps: 1. Determine the percentage composition: Make sure you have the information about the percentage composition of each element in the compound. 2. Convert percentages to mass: Since percentages represent the parts of a substance per hundred, you can assume a total mass of 100 grams. In this way, the percentage of each element becomes its mass in grams. 3. Convert mass to moles: Divide the mass of each element by its molar mass (atomic weight) to find the number of moles of each element. The molar mass can be found on the periodic table. 4. Find the mole ratio: Divide the moles of each element by the smallest number of moles to obtain a whole number ratio. If the result is not a whole number, multiply all the ratios by the smallest possible value to get a whole number. 5. Determine empirical formula: Write the empirical formula by combining the elements with their corresponding whole number obtained in step 4. It's important to note that the empirical formula doesn't provide information about the actual molecular structure or total number of atoms in a molecule, but rather the simplest whole number ratio between the elements in the compound."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical next event?

This may include the following: 1. Recommending a saline solution or an over-the-counter wound wash specifically designed for piercings as a cleansing agent. This sterile solution can gently clean the pierced area and facilitate healing. 2. Instructing the individual to clean the piercing two to three times a day. Ensuring the wound is kept clean and free from bacteria is crucial to avoiding infection and promoting a smooth recovery. 3. Advising them to avoid touching the piercing with unwashed hands. Touching the piercing with dirty hands can introduce bacteria and other pathogens which can cause infection. 4. Suggesting they avoid swimming in pools, hot tubs, or other bodies of water for at least 2-3 weeks to prevent exposure to bacteria and potential infection. 5. Reminding them that it is essential to avoid changing the jewelry prematurely. The healing process for a septum piercing typically takes around 6 to 8 weeks, but it can vary for each individual. The person should wait until the piercing is fully healed before changing or removing their jewelry. 6. Informing them of potential signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, excessive pain, or discharge. Should any of these symptoms occur, the individual may be advised to consult a healthcare professional to receive appropriate treatment. 7. Encouraging them to maintain a healthy lifestyle during the healing process - this includes staying well-hydrated, eating nutrient-rich foods, and getting adequate sleep. A healthy immune system can expedite the healing process. Once the man has provided all the necessary instructions and answered any questions or concerns the person may have, he would likely give them a follow-up appointment date to check on the progress of the healing and ensure the piercing does not present any further complications.

Here are the steps I followed: 1. Research: I searched for the most recommended and commonly used methods to remove water from the ear. 2. List methods: I found several methods like jiggling your earlobe, using a hairdryer, yawning, tilting your head, applying a warm compress, and using over-the-counter eardrops. 3. Analyze effectiveness: I evaluated each method based on its ability to remove water from the ear. I found that tilting your head and using gravity along with jiggling the earlobe could be very effective. Yawning and using a hairdryer can also help, but they may not be as efficient or comfortable. 4. Analyze safety: I looked at each method's safety. I found that using eardrops or inserting anything into the ear canal (like cotton swabs) can potentially cause harm to the ear. Using a hairdryer may cause burns or dryness if not used at a safe distance and properly. 5. Choose the best method: Based on my analysis of effectiveness and safety, the best technique to remove water from one's ear is tilting the head toward the affected side, gently jiggling the earlobe, and allowing gravity to drain out the water.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing. After what Abduraheem's story, how does he probably feel about being a Christian? - He now feels that he can be proud and open to being a Christian - He now feels that his religion doesn't do him any good - He now still feels reserved and doesn't share openly that he is a Christian - not enough information Answer:","output":"He now feels that he can be proud and open to being a Christian"},{"instruction":"Write a sentence in Spanish.","output":"\\"Durante nuestra visita al hermoso paisaje de montañas y valles en España, descubrimos una gran variedad de flora y fauna exóticas, experimentamos su rica cultura y compartimos momentos inolvidables con la acogedora gente local.\\" In English, this sentence can be translated as: \\"During our visit to the beautiful landscape of mountains and valleys in Spain, we discovered a wide variety of exotic flora and fauna, experienced its rich culture, and shared unforgettable moments with the welcoming local people.\\" This sentence illustrates a memorable experience while visiting the diverse natural wonders and cultural aspects of Spain."},{"instruction":"In this task you are given a medical question pair hand-generated.

Broken bone: This option is not related to welding, home improvement, or manufacturing directly. Metal rods can indeed be used in medical procedures, but it's not a common context of the mentioned activities. So, this option can be eliminated. 2. Construction site: Welding and metal rods are used in the construction site for joining metal elements during building construction. Home improvement could involve remodeling or updating structural features that may require welding or metal rods. Manufacturing for construction materials would also involve the use of welding and metal rods. So, this option is highly relevant. 3. Shops: Shops might sell some welding equipment or home improvement tools, but the use of metal rods or welding in the context of the shops themselves would be limited. Manufacturing might be relevant if shops are being built with metalworks, but compared to other options, this one is less relevant. 4. Cars: Welding and metal rods could be found in car manufacturing and some home improvement, like fixing or modifying cars. So, the relevancy is there, but it is less than the construction site option, as it doesn't cover all contexts as well. 5.

One of the fundamental components of astrology is the zodiac sign, which associates our birthdates with specific characteristics and attributes. So, how can we locate our sign, find its meaning, and understand the various elements that might influence how it is read? In this article, we will explore these subjects and provide a clear roadmap to delve into the fascinating world of astrology. Step 1: Locate Your Zodiac Sign There are twelve zodiac signs, each representing a thirty-degree slice of the 360-degree celestial belt called the Zodiac. Astrologers assign a specific zodiac sign based on the sun's position when an individual is born. To locate your sign, you will need to know your exact birthdate and refer to the list below: 1. Aries: March 21 - April 19 2. Taurus: April 20 - May 20 3. Gemini: May 21 - June 20 4. Cancer: June 21 - July 22 5. Leo: July 23 - August 22 6. Virgo: August 23 - September 22 7. Libra: September 23 - October 22 8. Scorpio: October 23 - November 21 9. Sagittarius: November 22 - December 21 10. Capricorn: December 22 - January 19 11. Aquarius: January 20 - February 18 12. Pisces: February 19 - March 20 Step 2: Learn the Meaning of Your Sign Now that you have located your zodiac sign, you can begin to explore its meaning. Each sign has unique qualities, such as specific elemental associations, symbolic imagery, and ruling planets. These aspects give insights into a person's personality traits, behaviors, and preferences. For example, Aries is a fire sign ruled by Mars, symbolizing energy, passion, and courage. Individuals born under this sign are known for their leadership skills, enthusiasm, and competitive nature. To learn more about your zodiac sign's specific qualities, you can consult astrology websites, books, or consult with an astrologer who can provide a comprehensive reading tailored to your birth chart. Step 3: Understand What Can Affect How Your Sign is Read It is essential to consider that various elements can influence how astrologers interpret a zodiac sign. Some of these factors include: - Birth chart: Your birth chart, or natal chart, is a snapshot of the position of the planets at the exact moment of your birth. This unique map of the cosmos can provide more nuanced insights into their astrological profile beyond their sun sign. - Moon sign: The position of the moon in your chart has a significant impact on your emotional temperament and subconscious desires. Find your moon sign by knowing your birth time, date, and location, and factoring this information into an astrological calculator. - Ascendant (or rising) sign: The ascendant is the sign that was rising over the eastern horizon at the precise moment you were born. This sign dictates how others perceive you and how you approach the world, adding another layer to your astrological profile. - Planetary aspects: Planets within your birth chart form relationships called aspects, which can have a positive or negative influence on your personality and astrological expressions. These aspects contribute to the overall complexity of a complete astrological reading. Conclusion: Astrology offers a wealth of knowledge to those willing to explore its mysteries and unveil the hidden layers of their personalities. By locating your zodiac sign, understanding its meaning, and acknowledging the various factors that affect its interpretation, you can unlock a world of self-discovery and embrace the celestial wisdom that astrology has to offer."},{"instruction":"Q: If I tell you that Gravity pulls objects toward celestial bodies, and ask you the question \\"what does gravity pull objects closer to?\\", is the correct answer \\"something to move\\"?

This could mean that the movie was enjoyable, met its intended goals, or provided a gratifying experience for the viewer. Interpretations of the term \\"satisfyingly\\" can vary, but in the context of a movie review, it usually denotes a sense of contentment or a positive experience. On the negative side, the term \\"scarifying\\" is generally associated with creating feelings of fear, horror, or emotional distress.

This scenario might commonly be seen in a hospital setting or at home with elderly or disabled care wherein patients are incapable of putting on their clothes by themselves due to their health condition. Hence, they require help from healthcare professionals or caregivers to put on their clothes, also known as dressing the patient. This use of the term 'dress' comes under the more literal usage of the word. In Sentence 2: \\"Dress the plants in the garden\\", the word \\"dress\\" is used in a different context meaning to prepare the plants or soil for planting or growth. Here, dressing usually involves adding nutrients to the soil which can be in the form of fertilizer, compost, or manure to enrich the soil thereby stimulating plant growth. This type of dressing helps to improve the soil's condition making it more conducive for plants to thrive. Therefore, this is a specific term used in gardening or agriculture context. So, despite having the same word 'dress', the meaning significantly differs based on the context and subjects involved.

He is on a government wanted list. Opposition activists said officers went to the hospital in Kiev to arrest him. The police said they had opened an inquiry into his abduction and were trying to question him about that. One interior ministry official said there were suspicions the abduction was faked as part of an attempt at provoking unrest. Local reports later said the officers had left without questioning Mr Bulatov, but some police guards had been posted at the hospital. Protests broke out in November, when President Viktor Yanukovych pulled out of a deal with the EU in favour of a Russian bailout. In mid-January, police and demonstrators clashed after the government passed a law severely restricting protesters' rights. Mr Yanukovych has since ordered the law repealed, signed an amnesty for protesters and accepted the resignation of his cabinet. Mr Bulatov, who was found bloodied and bedraggled on the outskirts of the capital on Thursday, said he had been left to die by his captors. \\"They crucified me, so there are holes in my hands now,\\" he said. \\"They cut off my ear, cut up my face. My whole body is a mess. You can see everything. I am alive.

In this case, since l is being multiplied by -28, you'll need to perform the opposite operation to isolate l. Hence, divide both sides of the equation by -28: l = -392 / -28 The negatives on both the numerator and denominator will cancel out leaving: l = 392 / 28 Performing the division, we then find that: l = 14 Therefore, the solution to the equation -28*l = -948 + 556 is l = 14."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Turkish: The interior ministry has pressed charges in 12 cases -- seven for criminal acts and five for violations.

Jenny washed her sweaters for the trip but not the pants, because the Available choices: a). sweaters were less dirty.; b). pants were less dirty.;","output":"Jenny was busy preparing her clothes for her upcoming trip. As she sorted out her wardrobe, she realized that she had to decide which clothes needed washing and which ones could be packed right away. After careful consideration, she decided to wash her sweaters but not the pants, because the pants were less dirty. Jenny's decision was based on a practical approach as she wanted to ensure that she would feel comfortable and confident in her outfits during the trip. Jenny remembered that she had worn her pants just once or twice since the last time she had washed them. Also, she had mostly worn them indoors, so she was confident that her pants had not been exposed to much dirt or dust. Thus, given the limited usage, her pants were significantly cleaner compared to her sweaters that had been worn more often. On the other hand, Jenny's sweaters had seen a lot more use in recent weeks due to fluctuating weather conditions. She had worn them for extended periods, sometimes even for the entire day. Consequently, her sweaters had accumulated more sweat and grime, making them smell unpleasant. The fabric had also lost some of its softness, and she was afraid it might cause irritation if not washed before the trip. There were additional factors that influenced Jenny's decision. By laundering her sweaters and not her pants, she could save time and energy, which was especially important considering her trip was fast approaching. Washing pants typically required more water and detergent than washing sweaters, as the denser fabric of pants made it harder to dislodge dirt and stains. As a result, by choosing not to wash her pants, Jenny was being eco-friendly and conserving resources. Moreover, the thought of ironing her pants discouraged her from washing them before the trip. Ironing pants could be a tedious task, making sure every crease was crisp and the fabric lay smooth. Although Jenny was an adept ironer, she did not want to add another unnecessary chore to her pre-trip preparations. Whereas with her sweaters, there was no need to worry about ironing, allowing her to spend that time packing and organizing her other belongings. So, Jenny proceeded to wash only her sweaters, carefully using a mild detergent and cold water to avoid any potential damage to the fabric. Once they were clean and dried, she folded them neatly and packed them into her suitcase. By opting to pack her pants without washing them, as they were less dirty, she not only saved time and energy but also ensured that her outfits would remain fresh and appealing throughout her trip. In conclusion, Jenny's decision to wash her sweaters but not her pants was justified, as it was both practical and environmentally conscious. This allowed her to focus on other essential aspects of her trip preparations while also ensuring that she would have clean and comfortable outfits to wear during her journey."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.

The tragic incident has left several families shattered while raising significant concerns about safety measures and infrastructural conditions in the region. In this article, we take a closer look at the causes of the explosion, its possible repercussions, and the need for reassessment of safety protocols. The Explosion: What Happened The massive explosion occurred in a gas pipeline running through the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, a densely populated region of India known for its agricultural contributions and industrial areas. The precise cause of the explosion has not yet been confirmed. Still, preliminary investigations suggest that it could be attributed to a technical failure or a possible leak in the pipeline. The explosion had severe consequences; the impact of the blast demolished several houses, engulfed nearby vegetation in flames, and caused panic among residents. The intensity of the explosion left at least 14 people dead and several others injured. Local authorities and emergency services rushed to the area to conduct rescue operations, tend to the injured, and search for any remaining survivors. Repercussions of the Tragedy Residents in the affected areas have been left in a state of shock, as the explosion has claimed the lives of family members and friends or caused severe injury. The regional government will likely face public outcry, demanding answers and seeking immediate action. Furthermore, the incident may lead to public backlash against the state-owned gas company operating the pipeline, posing questions about the safety and maintenance of their infrastructure. The government may also face allegations of negligence and lack of oversight, as they are responsible for ensuring regular safety checks and monitoring of infrastructure projects, especially those involving hazardous materials such as natural gas. The incident, therefore, raises significant questions about the existing regulatory framework and its effectiveness in preventing such accidents in India. A Wake-up Call for Assessing Safety Measures The unfortunate incident in Andhra Pradesh serves as a wake-up call for regulatory authorities across India that the current safety and monitoring protocols might be insufficient to ensure the security and integrity of vital infrastructure facilities. There is an urgent need for a thorough review of the current safety measures and the implementation of stricter guidelines to prevent such disasters from occurring in the future. Key areas for improvement include: 1. Regular Routine Inspections: Ensuring that pipelines undergo regular, comprehensive checks for any signs of damage or wear. This also entails a strict monitoring of the repairs and maintenance conducted in case of any identified issues. 2. Advanced Leak Detection Systems: Investing in the development and integration of advanced leak detection systems, accompanied by emergency shutdown mechanisms, to minimize the risk of accidents tied to gas leaks. 3. Enhanced Regulatory Framework: Implementing a more stringent regulatory framework with clearly-defined responsibilities for the companies and authorities involved in the pipeline operations. Failure to comply should be met with serious sanctions and penalties. 4. Community Preparedness Programs: Educating local communities living near pipelines or other hazardous infrastructures about the potential risks and the necessary precautions to take in case of an emergency. This will enable them to play a proactive role in preventing disasters and reacting effectively during dire situations. Conclusion The tragic gas pipeline explosion in Andhra Pradesh is an unfortunate reminder of the potential risks and devastating consequences tied to inadequate safety measures of hazardous infrastructures. It is crucial for the Indian government, regulatory authorities, and companies involved in such projects to learn from these incidents and implement robust safety protocols and monitoring systems in order to prevent such disasters in the future and safeguard the lives of citizens."},{"instruction":"Write a (A). yelp review (pick from the following.

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely. Question: \\"When did the Sudanese regime begin to change?\\" Answer: \\"After the UN sanctions\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer \\"After the UN sanctions\\" is not correct. The Sudanese regime began to change prior to the UN sanctions. The change started as outside pressures mounted, and General Omar al Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The UN Security Council only sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996 after they refused to hand over individuals involved in the assassination plot of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995. The change in the Sudanese regime was already underway before the sanctions took place."},{"instruction":"Translate to Romanian: Based on the assessment that it carried out, the Commission came to the conclusion that all the necessary conditions had been satisfied.

The answer is:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what do genes contain?\\" is not \\"viruses.\\" Genes contain the genetic information, or blueprints, for the development, function, and reproduction of living organisms. This genetic information is composed of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and, in some cases, ribonucleic acid (RNA). The information in DNA is organized into units known as genes, which are segments of DNA that code for specific proteins that perform essential functions in the organism. Although genes do contain blueprints, it is a misconception to equate them with viruses. Viruses are infectious agents that often consist of a protein coat surrounding a nucleic acid core, which may be either DNA or RNA. Viruses replicate by invading the cells of a host organism and utilizing the host's cellular machinery to create new copies of themselves, which can then infect other cells. In some instances, viruses may insert their genetic material into the host's genome, which can lead to the transmission of viral genetic information between generations. However, this does not mean that genes inherently contain viruses; rather, it is a process by which viral genetic material can be incorporated into an organism's DNA. Genes are essential components of an organism's genome, holding the information required for building, maintaining, and ensuring the continuity of life. The genetic information in genes instructs cells on how to create proteins, which are molecules that serve various functions in the growth, development, and maintenance of living organisms. In contrast, viruses are foreign entities that invade cells to reproduce, often causing harm to their hosts in the process. In summary, the right answer to the question \\"what do genes contain?\\" is genetic information in the form of DNA and, occasionally, RNA. While genes do contain blueprints for the development, function, and reproduction of living organisms, this does not equate to them containing viruses. Instead, viruses are infectious agents that may affect an organism's genetic material, potentially incorporating their own genetic information into the host's genome. The distinction between genes and viruses is crucial for understanding the fundamental workings of biology and genetics."},{"instruction":"The group reconvened once again to make The W, though without Ol' Dirty Bastard, who was at the time incarcerated in California for violating the terms of his probation. Though incarcerated, ODB managed to make it onto the track \\"Conditioner\\" which featured Snoop Dogg. ODB's vocals were recorded via the telephones used for inmates to talk with visitors, while in prison. The W was mostly well received by critics, particularly for The RZA's production, and also gave the group a hit single with the uptempo \\"Gravel Pit\\", part of a trilogy of videos where the group would visit different eras with a time traveling elevator, which also included \\"Protect Ya Neck (The Jump Off)\\" and \\"Careful (Click, Click)\\", which were then followed by \\"I Can't Go to Sleep\\" featuring Isaac Hayes. The album would go on to reach double platinum status. Shortly before the release of The W, ODB escaped custody while being transported from a rehab center to a Los Angeles court and was considered a fugitive. At a record release party for The W, ODB appeared with his face hidden by an orange parka, and was not recognized until introduced to the crowd. With police officers present outside, ODB performed briefly and then fled, fearing capture. Six days later ODB caused a commotion, signing autographs in a McDonald's at Broad & Girard Street in North Philadelphia. Unaware of who was causing the commotion, the manager called the police. When the law arrived, ODB mistook them for fans until they drew their guns. ODB fled the facility, but was stopped while trying to start his vehicle. After presenting a fake ID, he admitted his real identity, and was arrested. In 2001, the Wu-Tang Clan released Iron Flag, an album which made extensive use of outside producers and guests. Its crossover vibe and features, including Ron Isley, Flavor Flav, and prominent producers Trackmasters, marked it as a lighter fare; while critically praised, it gained a less than stellar reputation with fans. Group member Ghostface Killah would later denounce the record. While originally featured on the cover of Iron Flag, Cappadonna was airbrushed out of the artwork and absent from the album entirely. This may be related to tension that arose within the group when it was revealed that Cappadonna's manager was, or had been, a police informant, a revelation that also brought on the manager's subsequent firing. Cappadonna would however, continue collaborating and touring with the group in the upcoming years.

Feinstein photographs were the centerpieces of albums by, from left, Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan and George Harrison. Barry Feinstein, a photographer who chronicled the lives of seminal rock ’n’ roll stars of the 1960s, and who was perhaps best known for the stark portrait of Bob Dylan on the cover of the 1964 album “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” died on Thursday in a hospital near his home in Woodstock, N.Y. He was 80. His death was confirmed by his agent, Dave Brolan, who said that Mr. Feinstein suffered from several ailments and had recently been hospitalized with an infection. Besides his work with Mr. Dylan, Mr. Feinstein established his reputation as one of rock’s semiofficial official chroniclers with two 1970 photographs: one of Janis Joplin, taken the day before she died, which appeared on the cover of her final album, “Pearl,” and one of George Harrison, sitting in the middle of a pile of toppled, gnomic lawn statuary, which became the cover of “All Things Must Pass,” his first album after the breakup of the Beatles. Mr. Feinstein began as a photographer for Columbia Pictures in the 1950s, shooting pictures of movie stars like Judy Garland and Steve McQueen. But he found his true calling after hours, and outside the office, in taking pictures of stars as they moved through the real world: among the Hollywood photos he became known for was one of a heartbroken Marlene Dietrich at Gary Cooper’s funeral and another of Marlon Brando at a civil rights march facing counterdemonstrators taunting him with racist signs. Mr. Feinstein attributed his career in rock photography to a chance meeting with Mr. Dylan in the early 1960s at the office of a longtime friend, Albert Grossman, who was then Mr. Dylan’s manager, and who had also introduced Mr. Feinstein to his second wife, Mary Travers, of the folk-singing trio Peter, Paul and Mary. In an interview many years later, Mr. Dylan said he had admired Mr. Feinstein’s Hollywood photographs, which he said reminded him of the work of the photographer and filmmaker Robert Frank. “Just in their stark atmosphere,” he said. “I liked the angles Barry used.” For the cover of “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” Mr. Feinstein said he borrowed the patio of a friend’s Upper East Side penthouse apartment. Photographed from below, the black-and-white portrait depicted a grim-faced Mr. Dylan, gazing downward with the look of a man passing before the casket at a funeral. “Bobby was easy to shoot,” Mr. Feinstein said in a promotional interview conducted recently for a showing of his work at the Morrison Hotel Gallery in SoHo — as, he added, were most rock-’n’-rollers. “Musicians are actually easier to photograph than movie stars. They’re just not as uptight.” Barry Feinstein was born in Philadelphia on Feb. 4, 1931, the only child of David and Rose Feinstein. He never studied photography. “He started out working at a racetrack in Atlantic City and met Louis Kahn, the great architect, at breakfast one day,” said Judith Jamieson, Mr. Feinstein’s wife. “Louis Kahn told him to go west, so he did.” Besides Ms. Jamieson, Mr. Feinstein is survived by two children from previous marriages, Alicia Travers Feinstein and Alex Feinstein; three stepchildren, Erica Marshall, Jake Jamieson and Jasper Jamieson; and three grandchildren. Mr. Feinstein was the official photographer for Mr. Dylan’s 1966 European tour, which marked the singer’s ballyhooed switch from acoustic troubadour to electric guitar-playing rock ’n’ roller. In 2008, Mr. Feinstein published a book, “Hollywood Foto-Rhetoric: The Lost Manuscript,” featuring 23 of his early Hollywood pictures, accompanied by a series of prose poems written in 1964 by Mr. Dylan. The photos and poems had been packed away in an attic. In a Q. & A. interview in the preface to the book, Mr. Feinstein recounted a trip he and Mr. Dylan once took across the country in a Rolls-Royce, before Mr. Dylan’s greatest fame. It was not a working trip, just a favor for a friend; Mr. Grossman had bought the car in California and needed it driven east. Answering one of the interviewer’s questions — “What has been the best part of the job for you?” — Mr. Feinstein harked back to his buddy-movie moment with Mr. Dylan in his answer. “Just traveling, taking great commissions to do different projects, album covers, stories. You know, Dylan and I drove across the country,” he said, adding, “It was really a great adventure.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Having carefully reviewed that request, we see no basis for publishing a correction. The Globe story was entirely accurate. The Globe story was based on government documents filed by Bain Capital itself. Those described Governor Romney as remaining at the helm of Bain Capital as its “sole stockholder, chairman of the board, chief executive officer, and president” until 2002. The story also cited state financial disclosure forms filed by Romney that showed he earned income as a Bain “executive” in 2001 and 2002, separate from investment earnings. The Globe story accurately described the contents of those documents. The Globe story also gave a full account of the Romney campaign’s position that, notwithstanding several years of regulatory filings, Mitt Romney “retired from Bain Capital in 1999 … (and) has had no involvement in the management or investment activities of Bain Capital, or with any of its portfolio companies, since that time.” In your correction request, you reiterate points that are fully detailed in the Globe story. Sincerely, Martin Baron Editor, The Boston Globe ||||| New evidence for when Romney really left Bain Capital. FORTUNE -- Mitt Romney did not manage Bain Capital's investments after leaving to run the Salt Lake City Olympic Games, according to confidential firm documents obtained by Fortune. The timing of Romney's departure from Bain became a lightning rod earlier today, when The Boston Globe published an article suggesting that Romney remained actively involved with the firm longer than he and his campaign have claimed. The sourcing is largely SEC documents that list Romney as Bain Capital's CEO and sole shareholder through 2002 -- or three years after Romney officially left to run the Salt Lake City Olympic Games. These claims are very similar to ones made last week by David Corn in Mother Jones, which we disputed at the time. Now Fortune has obtained new evidence that supports Romney's version of events. Bain Capital began circulating offering documents for its seventh private equity fund in June 2000. Those documents include several pages specifying fund management. The section begins: Set forth below is information regarding the background of the senior private equity investment professionals of Bain Capital. Also listed are certain investment professionals responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the Brookside and Sankaty funds, which are affiliated funds of Fund VII. It then goes on to list 18 managers of the private equity fund. Mitt Romney is not among them. Same goes for an affiliated co-investment fund, whose private placement memorandum is dated September 2000. Then there is Bain Capital Venture Fund -- the firm's first dedicated venture capital effort -- whose private placement memorandum is dated January 2001. Romney also isn't listed among its \\"key investment professionals,\\" or as part of its day-to-day operations or investment committee. All of this could prove problematic for the Obama campaign, which has spent the day crowing over the Globe story (going so far as to hold a media call about it). \\"When Mitt Romney ran for governor and now as he's running for president, he consistently claimed he could not be blamed for bankruptcies and layoffs from Bain investments after February 1999 because he departed for the Olympics,\\" said Obama spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter, according to the Globe. \\"Now, we know that he wasn't telling the truth.\\" But the contemporaneous Bain documents show that Romney was indeed telling the truth about no longer having operational input at Bain -- which, one should note, is different from no longer having legal or financial ties to the firm. As Fortune wrote earlier, Romney left Bain suddenly -- rather than as part of an organized transition plan -- after being asked to lead an Olympic organizing committee that had spiraled out of control. Moreover, it was unclear in February 1999 if Romney's leave of absence would be permanent, or if he would return (as he had in 1994, after losing a U.S.Senate race to Ted Kennedy). He didn't formally give up his title and firm ownership until 2002, once the Games had been successful and he was interested in other elective office. In the interim, he continued to fulfill legal obligations such as signing certain documents -- but actual investment and managerial decisions were being made by others. After being informed of the Bain Capital documents, Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt emailed over the following statement: \\"Mitt Romney either misled the American people or misrepresented himself to the SEC. Romney has said he had no authority or responsibility for managing Bain since 1999, but that has been proven false. Regardless of whether he was on the management committee for this particular deal, he remained President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board and he was legally responsible for every investment and decision made by Bain.\\" Sign up for Dan's daily email newsletter on deals and deal-makers: GetTermSheet.com |||||","output":"In 2012, an article published by The Boston Globe questioned the timing of Mitt Romney's departure from Bain Capital.

Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

People might perceive traditional medicine as not being able to address their specific health issues effectively or as causing undesired side effects from medications. Additionally, increased waiting times to see family doctors, high medical costs, and the impersonal nature of healthcare could sway people to look for alternative options. In contrast, alternative medical practitioners usually adopt a personalized and holistic approach to healthcare, often focusing on prevention and natural treatments. This approach may appeal to individuals who value natural remedies, wellness, and mental-health-related aspects of well-being. **Increasing Popularity of Alternative Medicine** Over the years, the popularity of alternative medicine has significantly increased, as seen in the rising number of educational institutions, professional associations, and conferences dedicated to these practices. The growing body of research supporting the effectiveness of alternative treatments in managing or preventing chronic conditions like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease has further strengthened its credibility. Additionally, celebrities and influential personalities endorsing alternative medicine contribute to its increasing demand, as they share their positive experiences and outcomes with the masses. **Implications of the Hypothesis** If the hypothesis \\"Oddly enough, people in the US are now more likely to go to an alternative-medicine provider than to a traditional western physician\\" is accurate, it implies several consequences for the healthcare industry. 1. Healthcare practitioners in traditional western medicine might need to adapt their practices to remain competitive. This could involve incorporating elements of alternative medicine into their practice or providing more personalized and holistic care. 2. The healthcare industry may experience a shift in policy and regulations to accommodate the increasing demand for alternative medicine. This could include changes in insurance coverage, public funding, and practitioner licensure. 3. Educational institutions for healthcare professionals may need to update their curricula, teaching both physicians and alternative medicine practitioners about each other's disciplines. This could foster collaboration and promote the integration of different healthcare approaches. 4. More resources may be invested in research on alternative medicine to better understand its efficacy, validate its effectiveness, and identify potential risks or interactions with other treatments. 5. Patients' trust in traditional western medicine might be weakened, which could affect their adherence to prescribed treatments or their willingness to consult traditional healthcare providers. This highlights the need for improved communication between patients and healthcare providers to ensure the best possible care. In conclusion, if the premise that Americans now visit alternative medicine practitioners more often than they visit family doctors holds true, it significantly entails the hypothesis that people in the US are more likely to go to an alternative medicine provider than a traditional western physician. This trend points to various reasons, such as dissatisfaction with traditional healthcare, the appealing nature of alternative medicine, and its increased popularity. If true, healthcare practitioners, industry policies, and educational institutions must adapt to ensure that patients continue to receive effective and high-quality care."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Aponoea is a genus of moth in the family Gelechiidae.

The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.

Stream of consciousness:","output":"Here, we are given a box containing 3 blue marbles, 4 red marbles, 6 green marbles, and 2 yellow marbles. We need to find the probability that if we pick 4 marbles at random, none of them will be blue. Total marbles = 3 blue + 4 red + 6 green + 2 yellow = 15 marbles We want to find the probability of picking 4 marbles without any blue marbles. That means we can only pick from the remaining marbles (red, green, and yellow). There are 4 red, 6 green, and 2 yellow marbles, which make a total of 12 marbles that are not blue. We need to find the probability of picking 4 marbles from these 12 non-blue marbles. To calculate this probability, we will use the combinations formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!) Where C(n, r) is the number of combinations, n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. Thus, the number of ways to choose 4 marbles from the 12 non-blue marbles is: C(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12-4)!) = 12! / (4!8!) = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 495 Now, we will find the number of ways to choose any 4 marbles out of the total marbles (15). C(15, 4) = 15! / (4!(15-4)!) = 15! / (4!11!) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 1365 Now, we can calculate the probability that none of the 4 marbles picked is blue by dividing the number of ways to pick 4 non-blue marbles by the total way to pick any 4 marbles: Probability(None is Blue) = (Number of ways to choose 4 non-blue marbles) / (Total ways to choose 4 marbles) = 495 / 1365 = 33 / 91 So, the probability that none of the 4 marbles picked is blue is 33/91.

Just as the Dad in a family makes decisions about how to spend the family's money, the finance minister in Northern Ireland makes important decisions that affect everybody living there. Recently, the finance minister in Northern Ireland told his team - think of them as his helpers - to start working on something very special. This special thing is like a set of rules or a plan, which is commonly known as a draft bill. The purpose of this particular draft bill is to allow for something called same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. You might be wondering what this term 'same-sex marriage' means. It's actually quite simple. Usually, a marriage is between a boy and a girl. But in a same-sex marriage, a boy can marry another boy or a girl can marry another girl. It's just like when you really like your best friend and want to be with them all the time! However, not every place allows these kinds of marriages. In Northern Ireland, up until now, boys couldn't marry boys and girls couldn't marry girls. That's why the finance minister has asked his team to work on this important draft bill, to make it possible for these kind of marriages to occur. Many people feel happy and excited about this. They believe it's important that everyone should be free to marry who they love, whether it's a boy marrying a boy or a girl marrying a girl. Just as you love playing with your friends and want to spend more time with them, these people want to be free to live and celebrate their lives with the people they love. So, the finance minister and his helpers have a big job ahead of them! They are working hard to write rules that will allow same-sex marriages in Northern Ireland.

If you'd still like to add some element of surprise, wait until she turns her head away from you before approaching her ear. If you already know her fairly well, you could try to surprise her by whispering from behind her. But do this only if you know she's not easily frightened, since it could produce a big scare. If you especially want to avoid startling her, you can try placing one hand gently on her shoulder before approaching her ear. If you're on her right side, use your right hand to cup your mouth. If you're on her left side, use your left hand to cup your mouth. This way your whispering will be shielded from the hearing of any others who might be in front of her or to her side. If her hair is covering her ear, avoid brushing it away if you've just met her that day. If you've been on at least a couple of dates, brushing her hair aside should be acceptable. If you've only just met the person, avoid making direct contact between your cupped hand and her ear. If she's your girlfriend or if you've been dating for some time, it should be okay to press your hand lightly against her ear while whispering. If you're in a noisy area such as a busy bar or at a party, you may have to speak above a whispering tone in order for her to hear you. Be careful not to yell, though. A tone slightly above a whisper should be audible, since your mouth will be close to her ear. But if there is little or no background noise in your area, speak slowly in a whisper. If she immediately moves away from you even before you get a chance to whisper, or after, you'll know to avoid trying to make physical contact with her for the moment. But if she responds with a smile, giggle, and sustained eye contact, you've done well. Yet be careful not to take a positive reaction as an invitation to move a step beyond by hugging her or holding her hand right away. Be content with having made her laugh and smile, and wait for a response from her, such as touching your hand or moving closer to you, that shows she's probably comfortable with more involved flirting.","output":"When you want to whisper in a girl's ear, don't do it from the front because it might look like you want to kiss her. Instead, try to surprise her by coming from the side or behind, but be careful not to scare her. Put a hand on her shoulder and use the other hand to cover your mouth, so other people can't hear you. If you're close to her, you can touch her ear a little, but if you just met, avoid touching her. If it's noisy, talk a bit louder than a whisper, but not too loud.

Captain Gunther leaves a note for Lee 's plans for treason . Gillis leaves a note for Captain Gunther explaining Lee 's plans for treason .","output":"No, these two sentences from Wikipedia don't have the same meaning even though they share some similar elements. Let's analyze each sentence to understand their differences. 1. \\"Captain Gunther leaves a note for Lee's plans for treason.\\" In this sentence, the main subject is Captain Gunther, and the action taken by him is leaving a note. The purpose of the note is to provide information about Lee's plans for treason. This sentence implies that Captain Gunther provides details of the treasonous plans associated with Lee. However, it doesn't specify who the note is left for—the intended recipient is unclear. 2. \\"Gillis leaves a note for Captain Gunther explaining Lee's plans for treason.\\" In this sentence, the main subject is different—it's Gillis instead of Captain Gunther. Gillis is the one leaving the note, and the intended recipient of the note is explicitly stated as Captain Gunther. The purpose of the note is to explain Lee's plans for treason, implying that Gillis is the one providing the information regarding the treasonous plans associated with Lee. In summary, while both sentences involve a note being left about Lee's plans for treason, the subjects performing the action of leaving the note and the intended recipients are different. In the first sentence, Captain Gunther is leaving the note, and the recipient is unclear. In the second sentence, Gillis is leaving the note specifically for Captain Gunther. The discrepancies in the subjects' actions and recipients lead to distinct meanings for each sentence."},{"instruction":"OPTIONS: * Never * In April * not enough information * At the end of this year Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question.

The document also calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action.

Trump also told VOA that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announced one concession long-sought by North Korea. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said. Trump said at later news conference that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" As for verification, Trump said he and Kim discussed the issue and that monitoring denuclearization efforts would be achieved “by having a lot of people there.” He also predicted Kim would begin work right away to “live up to” the agreement.

The following title sequence moves through space and eventually reveals the planet Krypton, the home world of a highly-evolved race resembling humans and bearing a unique molecular density and structure, a result of the planet's gravitational strength and the radiation of its adjacent red sun. The planet is ruled by a Council of Elders, each representing a particular \\"clan\\" and bearing a crest of that particular House. The planet's greatest scientist, Jor, bears an S-shaped crest, the House of El. Jor-El is supervising the trial of three criminals caught attempting to overthrow the planet's government - General Zod, the planet's former defense chief; his henchman Non, a hulking killer unable to speak; and Ursa, a woman determined to exterminate men other than the man she loves, Zod. As the elders render a guilty verdict, Zod notes that the verdict must be unanimous, so Jor-El ultimately holds the key to their fate. Despite his disillusionment with the Council of Elders, Jor-El renders a conviction. The vast dome of the planet's capital city opens to the night, and a small extra-dimensional prison - the Phantom Zone - tumbles out of the sky and pulls the three criminals out of the trial room and into an eternity in dimensional limbo through space. While a frightened Ursa begs for forgiveness, Zod defiantly swears that he will have his vengeance on the House of El, even if it takes him a thousand years.However, Jor-El's more pressing concern lies in the orbital shift of Krypton; this shift is putting the planet into the fatal gravitational pull of its central star, a fact blithely ignored by the Council Of Elders.

He played as a split end and spent his entire eleven-year professional career with the Green Bay Packers. Under head coach Curly Lambeau, Hutson led the Packers to four NFL Championship Games, winning three: 1936, 1939, and 1944. Context: Hutson was born on January 31, 1913, in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, one of three sons of Roy B. Hutson and Mabel Clark Hutson. While a Boy Scout, he played with snakes. He said that's where he got his quickness and agility. As a teenager Hutson played baseball for Pine Bluff's town team. As a senior at Pine Bluff High School he was an all-state basketball player, which he said was his favorite sport. \\"I'm like most [athletes],\\" he said. \\"I'd rather see football, but I'd rather play basketball.\\" Hutson played one year of football at Pine Bluff. Hutson played at end for coach Frank Thomas's Alabama Crimson Tide football team from 1932 to 1934. Bear Bryant, future long-time coach of the Tide, was the self-described \\"other end\\" on the Tide in 1933 and 1934. Bryant once remarked, \\"...he was something to see even then. We'd hitchhike to Pine Bluff just to watch him play. I saw him catch five touchdown passes in one game in high school.\\" Sportswriter Morgan Blake ranked the undefeated 1934 Tide as the best team he ever saw. Hutson's College Football Hall of Fame profile reads: \\"Fluid in motion, wondrously elusive with the fake, inventive in his patterns and magnificently at ease when catching the ball ... Hutson and fellow Hall of Famer Millard \\"Dixie\\" Howell became football's most celebrated passing combination.\\" Hutson had six catches for 165 yards, including two touchdowns of 54 and 59 yards in the 1935 Rose Bowl against Stanford. He also scored the winning touchdown over Robert Neyland's Tennessee Volunteers on an end-around. Hutson was recognized as a first-team All-American for six different organizations and received a second-team selection by one other.

Do you know why things burn? It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water.

Hakkai stared blankly into the darkness as he swallowed that bit of information . Was it triggered by the head injury , perhaps ? Why is Hakkai feeling some mental fuzziness ?","output":"Hakkai, the character in question, seems to be experiencing mental fuzziness due to a combination of factors. The text highlights a significant event in his past, described as a battle, which left him wrapped in bandages for an extended period. This event is directly related to his current state of confusion and mental discomfort. Here, we will analyze the potential contributing factors and provide a detailed explanation for Hakkai's mental fuzziness. 1. Physical trauma: The battle that Hakkai experienced, which led to him needing bandages, clearly indicates that he suffered some significant physical harm. Such trauma, particularly if it involved a head injury as hinted in the text, can have lasting effects on cognitive functioning. Traumatic brain injuries are known to result in various types of cognitive impairments, which may include memory problems, difficulty concentrating, and confusion. Given these possible outcomes, Hakkai's mental fuzziness could be a direct result of the physical trauma he suffered during the battle. 2. Emotional stress: In addition to the physical trauma, it is important to consider the emotional impact of Hakkai's experience. Going through a challenging ordeal like the one described can be extremely traumatic and may lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD often presents itself in various ways, including intrusive and distressing thoughts, flashbacks, emotional numbness, and cognitive difficulties. These symptoms could potentially contribute to Hakkai's mental fuzziness and hinder his ability to think clearly. 3. Coping mechanisms: Sometimes, when an individual experiences a difficult or traumatic event, they may employ coping mechanisms to help them deal with their emotions. One common coping strategy is repression, wherein the person pushes the memory of the event into their unconscious mind, effectively \\"blocking\\" it from conscious thought. Although this can provide temporary relief, the repressed memories may occasionally resurface, leading to confusion and an inability to recall the details of the event clearly. It is possible that Hakkai has repressed some memories related to the battle, and with this information being brought up again, he could be struggling to piece together the memories, adding to his mental fuzziness. 4. Fatigue: The text also mentions that Hakkai stared blankly into the darkness as he swallowed that bit of information. This detail suggests that Hakkai might be experiencing a degree of fatigue or exhaustion. A lack of proper rest can severely impact cognitive functioning and exacerbate feelings of mental fuzziness. In conclusion, Hakkai's mental fuzziness likely stems from a combination of factors, including physical trauma sustained in the battle, possible repressed memories or emotional stress related to the event, and his current state of fatigue or exhaustion. It is essential to consider all these factors when trying to understand Hakkai's feelings of confusion and the reasons behind his mental fuzziness."},{"instruction":"bird photos, bird pictures, sounds of birds Please write the text above using proper case.","output":"Bird photos, Bird pictures, Sounds of birds.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"We should ask ourselves much more often when it comes to such reports, even if they come from an international level, the question: Does it actually do anything? The given sentence, when translated into English, emphasizes the need to question the effectiveness or relevance of certain reports, particularly those originating from the international level. It suggests that, regardless of the origin or authority behind a report, it is essential to critically assess whether it makes a tangible difference or contributes positively to a given situation. In a broader context, this approach essentially champions the practice of critical thinking and maintaining a healthy skepticism in the face of information. This is particularly important in the modern age of information, wherein there is an abundance of news, reports, and data that can potentially influence our opinions and decisions. By consistently questioning if these reports actually make a difference, individuals can cut through unnecessary noise and focus on information that truly matters. Moreover, this perspective encourages the development of individual and collective responsibility. People should not always rely on outside sources or authorities to make essential decisions. Instead, it is crucial to thoroughly evaluate various sources and form one's own judgments. This promotes active engagement and fosters wisdom and discernment. This approach is essential when evaluating reports from an international perspective. Laws, regulations, and cultural norms vary from one country to another, which means that a comprehensive method may not be applicable across the board. Therefore, it is necessary to assess these reports on a case-by-case basis and analyze how they might be beneficial or detrimental in particular situations. Additionally, such an approach can help identify potential biases or power dynamics that might be at play in the creation or dissemination of a report. It is essential to recognize that some information may be designed to further specific agendas rather than genuinely improving the circumstances for all involved parties. In conclusion, consistently questioning the effectiveness of reports, regardless of their source, is a valuable approach to handling information in the modern world. By maintaining a healthy skepticism, individuals and communities can foster critical thinking and responsibility, ultimately leading to better, more informed decisions. This approach, when utilized at the international level, ensures that reports are carefully scrutinized and adapted to suit the needs of diverse populations globally."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What was the Great Migration? Context: Detroit, like many places in the United States, developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were attracted to the industrial city; in a short period it became the 4th-largest city in the nation. The Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city. Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the Ku Klux Klan beginning in 1915. \\"By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK,\\" whose members opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, as well as black Americans. The Black Legion, a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area in the 1930s, when one-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic Works Progress Administration organizer. A total of 49 men of the Black Legion were convicted of numerous crimes, with many sentenced to life in prison for murder. Answer:","output":"The Great Migration was a mass movement of rural blacks from the South to northern cities, such as Detroit, in the United States during the early to mid-20th century. This migration led to rapid demographic changes and increased competition for jobs and housing, as the African Americans were joined by southern whites, as well as southern and eastern European immigrants of Catholic and Jewish faith.

It is located 24 kilometres north of Winnipeg on Highway 59, and covers approximately 8300 acres (35.1 square kilometres). The area (and park) is named after Dr. Curtis Bird, first speaker of the Manitoba provincial legislature in 1873, whose father had been a factor in the Hudson's Bay Company and received a large land grant at this location. Since the area is higher than the surrounding terrain, what is now Birds Hill Park served early settlers as a refuge from flooding in the years 1826 and 1852. It is part of the RM of Springfield, with a relatively small portion lying within the Rural Municipality of St. Clements. The provincial park features a mixture of aspen and oak forest with open prairie/savannah, spruce, bog areas and mixed boreal forest communities, not commonly found so close together. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - The R.M. of Springfield was incorporated in 1880 as a result of changes made to the R.M. of Springfield and Sunnyside (1873-1880). The municipality received its name due to the presence of multiple natural springs found within its borders. Springfield stretches from urban industrial development on the eastern boundary of the City of Winnipeg, through urban, rural residential, agricultural and natural landscapes, to the Agassiz Provincial Forest on the municipality's eastern boundary. Birds Hill Provincial Park nestles into the northwestern corner of Springfield. While farming is still important in the municipality, today many residents are employed in nearby Winnipeg. In the 2011 census the population was 14,069, up 8.3% from 2006. - A community is commonly considered a social unit (a group of people) who have something in common, such as norms, values, or identity. Often - but not always - communities share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood). Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions like family, home, work, government, society, or humanity, at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties (micro-level), \\"community\\" may also refer to large group affiliations (or macro-level), such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities. - A post office is a customer service facility forming part of a national postal system. Post offices offer mail-related services such as acceptance of letters and parcels; provision of post office boxes; and sale of postage stamps, packaging, and stationery.

Aspiring filmmaker Sean is working as a freelance driver to make ends meet. He's assigned to deliver an expensive Mercedes-Benz from Los Angeles all the way to its owner in Miami, which will also allow him to attend the wedding of his sister. He's given strict instructions not to damage the vehicle or pick up any hitchhikers. Sean is driving cross country when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a vampire hunter hunting a group of vampires led by one of the Forsaken--a group of knights who made a pact with the fallen angel Abaddon to live forever. Two of the Forsaken are located in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and infected by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire virus is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism; killing a Forsaken kills his entire bloodline and reverses the condition of anyone infected. Nick believes that if he kills Kit, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge his new acquaintance; however, he is convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a diner, who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves he is telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight. Sean and Nick take Megan to their motel room, but she goes into a rage and bites Sean; they realize they must kill the Forsaken responsible to prevent Sean from turning. Forsaken can only be slain on hallowed ground, so the three head for a Spanish mission 60 miles away. They stop at a gas station where an old woman, Ina, lets them in. She shows them a newspaper connecting Megan to a bloodbath in Arizona; when Megan wakes up and is coherent enough to talk, she explains she was a victim of the vampires' bloodbath. Kit catches up to them and lays siege to the gas station. Answer:","output":"The names of the three people that head to the Spanish Mission are Sean, Nick, and Megan."},{"instruction":"You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews.

Eisenheim's magic trick The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: \\"Eisenheim's Enigma\\" It begins in Vienna during the early 1900s. Our protagonist, Thomas, is a scholar who inherits a mysterious yet intriguing folio from an unidentified source. Although the folio is filled with various mystical diagrams, parchments, and miscellaneous objects, he finds himself particularly fascinated by one specific entry - Eisenheim's magic trick. Thomas has heard rumors of Eisenheim - revered as the greatest magician of his time, whose magic trick has left generations bewitched, yet bewildered. However, the trick has never been duplicated as Eisenheim had supposedly never shared the secret with anyone. Intrigued by the unsolvable puzzle, Thomas commits himself to deciphering the trick using the folio. As Thomas delves deeper into Eisenheim's past, he starts uncovering a darker side to the magician’s story - Eisenheim was rumored to have real powers, engaging with supernatural entities that assisted him in performing extraordinary feats. This realization is both scary and enthralling for Thomas, as he wades deeper into the mystery. Parallelly, the city is enthralled by a new magician, Houdini, who is trying to make himself the greatest by implementing Eisenheim's magic trick. Blind to the spiritual world he's about to stumble upon, Houdini becomes both Thomas's unwitting ally and competitor. Thomas becomes obsessed with cracking Eisenheim's secret before Houdini, to preserve the trick's original dignity and stop Houdini from recklessly inviting supernatural forces. Along the way, he meets Sofia, a modern and bold woman who shares his interest in the supernatural. She supports his quest and helps him remain steadfast when pushed to the edge. The climax unwinds in a twist, where Thomas, Sofia, and Houdini end up performing the magic trick together, and in doing so, summon Eisenheim’s spirit. The spirit, distressed at his secret being misused, exacts a formidable spectacle, leaving the audience terrified. Realizing their mistake, Thomas, Sofia, and Houdini agree to keep the secret forever safe. Through a literal magical journey, Thomas learns that not every secret is meant to be unveiled. Sometimes, it's the mystery that keeps the magic alive. He decides to lock away the folio, but continues his study on magic in a more respectful and careful manner, preserving Eisenheim's legacy."},{"instruction":"Possibly the first house erected within the site was that of a Sir William Blake, around 1624.

Second question: What are some examples of ethics? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"As an AI language model, let me help you answer these questions one by one. First question: What are ethics? Ethics are a system of moral principles that govern a person's or group's behavior. They can also be defined as the study of what is morally right and wrong. Ethics involves considering how our decisions and actions affect other people, the environment, and the world. In simple terms, ethics helps us distinguish between what is right and what is wrong. Now, I'll provide some examples of ethics: 1. Honesty: Being truthful, reliable, and trustworthy in communication and actions. 2. Accountability: Taking responsibility for one's actions and decisions. 3. Integrity: Upholding strong moral principles and doing the right thing, even when it might be difficult or not advantageous. 4. Respect: Treating others with courtesy and dignity while recognizing and valuing their differences. 5. Compassion: Showing empathy and care for the feelings and experiences of others. Second question: What are some examples of ethics? This question is essentially asking the same thing as the first part of the first question, so the same examples mentioned earlier apply. To sum up, these two questions are related but not exactly the same. The first question asks for a definition of ethics and some examples, while the second question focuses solely on examples of ethics."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Article: MANCHESTER, England -- Here's some good news that vegetarians can really sink their teeth into: Researchers in UMA Group have developed genetically engineered fruit trees that produce real meat! Fruit from the new Meat Trees, developed by British scientists using the gene technology, is closely like ordinary grape-fruit. But when you cut the fruit open, inside is fresh beef! \\"Our trees may sound like something out of a science fiction movie, but it's really true,\\" declares Dr. Vincent, director of the UMA Group, which created the amazing trees. \\"Vegetarians have been complaining for years that in spite of their firm belief against eating meat, they still desire the taste of meat once in a while. Now they can have their cake and eat it too.\\" Although it's taken 12 years to develop the trees, the idea is simple. \\"We take the genes from cattle and put them into the cells of grape-fruit trees,\\" Dr. Vincent says. \\"When the seeds grow into trees, they produce meat instead of ordinary fruit. You get the taste -- even the smell.\\" Those who've tried the meat agree it tastes like the real thing. \\"I was a bit unwilling to believe at first when I sank my teeth into a hamburger after they told me it grew on a tree,\\" says Londoner Mark, who took part in a taste-test. \\"But it was juicy and delicious - nothing leafy about it at all.\\" Meat Tree products could be on the market in Great Britain by the end of next year.

The answer is:","output":"Yes, according to Dr. Vincent, vegetarians can eat meat from the new trees.

As a result, vegetarians now have the option to indulge in the taste and smell of meat without breaking their dietary restrictions. Londoner Mark, who participated in a taste test, confirmed that the meat from these trees tastes like the real thing, being \\"juicy and delicious\\" with no leafy texture.

Even Harry and William blended into the background. They could have been any other wedding guests. If anyone would show up the bride on her special day, it was going to be adorable Princess ­Charlotte and Prince George. But all the children were calm and happy to get on with each other, and I hope the pictures really tell the story. At one point little Charlotte stuck out her tongue in a cheeky pose.

Charlotte was supposed to throw petals from her little basket like the other flower girls but was happier staying with her mum. She has just had her second birthday so ­considering what a big day it was, she did really well. Speaking as a father myself, the most poignant moment came when Pippa arrived at the church in a lovely open top vintage Jaguar Mk V with her dad Michael.

I didn’t hear what he said to Pippa but it was as if he almost took a moment to stand back and look at her and she smiled. I think that’s what the memories of your children’s weddings are all about. You work hard to do the best for your kids like the Middletons have done, and seeing them get married is a dream come true. This was a special, special day. I wish Pippa and James all the ­happiness.

An expensive glass marquee was hired for the event, as were vintage cars and modern prestige vehicles - and posh portable loos. The wedding celebrated the groom's Scottish connections. His outfit, entertainment and the food — with haggis on the menu along with Scottish lamb and whisky — while there will also be a piper and a Spitfire flypast. Young royals George and Charlotte played starring roles as a page boy and bridesmaid. James's brother Spencer Matthews, a reality TV star who was a regular in the show Made In Chelsea, was there as best man. He shook hands with Prince Wills as they met outside church moments before the ceremony. Getty Images - WireImage Flynet Pictures Flynet Pictures But Matthews's girlfriend, reality TV star Vogue Williams, did not attend due to a \\"prior engagement\\", her spokesman said, adding she \\"wishes Pippa and James all the best on their special day\\". She was keeping herself busy by sharing a video of her working out in just a crop top and gym leggings. But it's believed James and Pippa brought in a “no ring, no bring” policy for the big day – banning any unmarried couples to bring their other half. Pippa’s brother James’ famous on-off girlfriend Donna Air was allowed to attend – but the groom’s reality TV star brother Spencer has allegedly been forbidden from bringing Brian McFadden’s ex Vogue Williams. The wedding's \\"social media ban\\" was broken early on by Pippa's black sheep uncle Gary – who has caused controversy in the past with his wild antics. It was widely speculated but not confirmed that Pippa had banned guests from posting photos to social media ahead of her wedding. Security was tight with several senior royals attending, guarded as usual by Scotland Yard royalty protection officers. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: \\"We are not prepared to discuss matters of security.\\" No-fly zones, banning aircraft including drones, balloons, kites and parachutes, were imposed over Bucklebury and Englefield between 6am on Friday and 3pm on Sunday. Rev Nick Wynne-Jones, who is the church's resident priest, officiated the wedding. On Friday family and friends flocked to the church where security teams were sweeping the grounds. The trial run for Pippa and her husband-to-be James Matthews's big day prompted a full-scale lockdown on the venue, less than 24 hours before the ceremony. Among the guests to arrive early for the wedding included the groom's brother Spencer, with dad David also spotted arriving at the venue. But the flurry of security activity didn't stop organisers from adding the final touches to the church to make it perfect for the 350 guests. We pay for your stories!

After exchanging her “I Dos” with new husband James Matthews in a private ceremony at St. Mark’s Church in Englefield, England, on Saturday, the 33-year-old new bride proudly showed off her antique Asscher cut engagement ring from English jeweler Robinson Pelham, along with a new addition — her wedding band. While Princess Kate‘s younger sister has a show-stopping engagement ring, it seems she went for an understated gold band that works perfectly with her dramatic diamond ring. REX/Shutterstock The ring is similar to sister Kate’s wedding ring, which is a simple Welsh gold band. British royal brides have been wearing Welsh gold bands as wedding rings for nearly 100 years.

It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - The Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (\\"Lernayin arabai Inknavar Marz, LIM\\") was an autonomous oblast within the borders of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, mostly inhabited by ethnic Armenians. According to Robert Service, in 1921 Joseph Stalin, then acting Commissar of Nationalities for the Soviet Union, included Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and Karabakh under Azerbaijani control to try to placate Turkey to join the Soviet Union. Had Turkey not been an issue, Stalin would probably have left Karabakh under Armenian control. As a result, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was established with the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic on July 7, 1923. According to Karl R. DeRouen it was created as an enclave so that a narrow strip of land would separate it from Armenia proper. According to Audrey L. Altstadt, the borders of the \\"oblast\\" were drawn to include Armenian villages and to exclude as much as possible Azerbaijani villages, so that the resulting area was sure to have an Armenian majority. - Samvel Babayan ( Armenian : ; born 5 March 1965 ) was an Armenian military commander and politician . He became a hero during the Nagorno - Karabakh War . Following the war , he served as the Defense Minister of the Nagorno - Karabakh Republic from 1994 to 2000 . During this period , Babayan \`\` became not only the military leader but the most powerful man in Karabakh overall , controlling its government and economy . '' - The Nagorno-Karabakh War, referred to as the Artsakh Liberation War (\\"Artsakhyan azatamart\\") by Armenians, was an ethnic conflict that took place in the late 1980s to May 1994, in the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in southwestern Azerbaijan, between the majority ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh backed by the Republic of Armenia, and the Republic of Azerbaijan. As the war progressed, Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet Republics, entangled themselves in a protracted, undeclared war in the mountainous heights of Karabakh as Azerbaijan attempted to curb the secessionist movement in Nagorno-Karabakh. The enclave's parliament had voted in favor of uniting itself with Armenia and a referendum, boycotted by the Azerbaijani population of Nagorno-Karabakh, was held, whereby most of the voters voted in favor of independence. The demand to unify with Armenia, which began anew in 1988, began in a relatively peaceful manner; however, in the following months, as the Soviet Union's disintegration neared, it gradually grew into an increasingly violent conflict between ethnic Armenians and ethnic Azerbaijanis, resulting in claims of ethnic cleansing by both sides. - Secession (derived from the Latin term \\"secessio\\") is the withdrawal of a group from a larger entity, especially a political entity (a country), but also any organization, union or military alliance. Threats of secession can also be a strategy for achieving more limited goals. - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, while having an 8 km border with Turkey in the north west. - Nagorno-Karabakh, officially the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR; \\"Lernayin Gharabaghi Hanrapetut'yun\\"), Artsakh Republic or Republic of Artsakh (\\"Arts'akhi Hanrapetut'yun\\"), is an unrecognised republic in the South Caucasus. The region is considered by the UN to be part of Azerbaijan, but is under the control of ethnic Armenian separatists. The NKR controls most of the territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and some of the surrounding area, giving it a border with Armenia to the west, Iran to the south, and the uncontested territory of Azerbaijan to the north and east. - Armenians (\\"hayer\\" ) are an ethnic group native to the Armenian Highlands. - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia.

Which film was released first, Triumph of the Will or Voices of Iraq? A:","output":"Triumph of the Will was released first. Now, I will provide a detailed background on both films. A: Triumph of the Will (Triumph des Willens) is a Nazi propaganda film directed, produced, edited, and co-written by Leni Riefenstahl. It was released on March 28, 1935. The film chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress held in Nuremberg, Germany, where various speeches and events involving Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, Viktor Lutze, and other prominent Nazi leaders took place. Triumph of the Will is known for its innovative and masterful use of film techniques to convey a powerful and persuasive message in favor of the Nazi regime. It has been widely studied as a prime example of propaganda in cinema and is also considered a valuable historical document that provides insights into the development of the cult of personality surrounding Adolf Hitler. B: Voices of Iraq is a 2004 documentary film produced and directed by Eric Manes, Martin Kunert, and Archie Drury. The filmmakers distributed over 150 handheld digital video cameras across Iraq and asked ordinary citizens to document their everyday lives, record their thoughts, and share their experiences during the U.S. occupation. The resulting footage was edited down into the final film, which gives a glimpse into the lives of the Iraqi people under the challenging conditions during that time. Voices of Iraq showcases diverse perspectives on the war, the U.S. intervention, and the dreams and aspirations of the Iraqi citizens. In conclusion, Triumph of the Will was released much earlier than Voices of Iraq, with over six decades separating the two films. While both movies represent different eras and purposes in filmmaking, they both provide valuable insight into the social and political climates of their respective times."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: W: We heard that when you are a kid, you submitted a story to Reader's Digest.

The answer to this question is:","output":"From the conversation, we learn a few things about the man: 1. He liked writing when he was a child: The man mentions that his idea of a great time was having a pad of lined paper and a new blue pen. This indicates that he enjoyed writing or expressing his thoughts on paper from a young age. Submitting a story to Reader's Digest also supports this notion. 2. He enjoyed reading stories in Reader's Digest: The man refers to himself as a Reader's Digest member at the age of six. This suggests that he was an avid reader of the magazine and appreciated the content published within. He admired the publication enough to not only read it but also to submit his own work, hoping to see it featured alongside the stories he enjoyed. However, the conversation does not provide enough information to support the statement that he used to be an editor of Reader's Digest. While he might have been a fan of the magazine and even contributed a story, there is no mention of his involvement with the publication in an editorial capacity.

Koolhaas studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London and at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Koolhaas is the founding partner of OMA, and of its research-oriented counterpart AMO based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In 2005, he co-founded Volume Magazine together with Mark Wigley and Ole Bouman. Context: Following the signing of Treaties of Nice in May 2001, which made Brussels the de facto capital of the European Union, the then President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi and the Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt invited Koolhaas to discuss the necessities and requirements of a European capital. During these talks and as an impetus for further discussion, Koolhaas and his think-tank AMO - an independent part of OMA - suggested the development of a visual language. This idea inspired a series of drawings and drafts, including the \\"Barcode\\". The barcode seeks to unite the flags of the EU member countries into a single, colourful symbol. In the current European flag, there is a fixed number of stars. In the barcode however, new Member States of the EU can be added without space constraints. Originally, the barcode displayed 15 EU countries. In 2004, the symbol was adapted to include the ten new Member States. Since the time of the first drafts of the barcode it has very rarely been officially used by commercial or political institutions. During the Austrian EU Presidency 2006, it was officially used for the first time. The logo was used for the EU information campaign, but was very negatively criticized. In addition to the initial uproar caused by the Estonian flag stripes being displayed incorrectly, the proposed flag failed to achieve its main objective as a symbol. Critics pointed the lack of capability to relate the signified (the mental concept, the European Union) with the signifier (the physical image, the stripes) as the major problem, as well as the presented justification for the order in which the color stripes were displayed (as every country in the EU should be regarded as equal in importance and priority). Question: what color was the flag. Whats the answer?","output":"The flag discussed here is not just a single color but it's actually made up of many colors. It's called a \\"Barcode\\" flag and it has different colors that represent different countries that are part of the European Union. So you see, it's very colorful, just like when you see many different colors in a drawing or painting. Each color stands for a different country in the European Union. Isn't that cool? Just imagine, each color stripe saying \\"Hello, I am representing this country\\". But remember, there was some trouble because some folks didn't think anyone would easily understand what all these colors meant, just like you might not understand why a zebra has black and white stripes!"},{"instruction":"Question: who wrote the poem that the words come from ode to joy??

Unfortunately, the experience left us quite dissatisfied. Upon entering, we noticed the restaurant was dimly lit, making it difficult to read the menu. Despite this, we placed our orders and eagerly anticipated our meal. Sadly, the service was quite slow. It took more than 40 minutes for our food to arrive, even though the restaurant didn't seem particularly busy that night. When we politely inquired about the delay, our server responded with a terse and unapologetic comment, making us feel unwelcome. The food quality was also underwhelming. My grilled chicken dish was rather dry, and the side of mashed potatoes was cold. My friends reported similar issues with their meals, such as a soggy, undercooked pizza and a flavorless salad. In order to improve, Taste Temptations should invest in better staff training, focusing on customer service, and enhancing food presentation and taste. Ensuring proper lighting for guests' comfort would also be beneficial. In conclusion, I cannot recommend Taste Temptations based on our experience.

Sentence 2: Economists highly value simplicity and determinism above all else. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine the veracity of the second sentence given the truth of the first sentence, it is necessary to understand the sentences individually and if they are actually related. Sentence 1: \\"Allowing for the possibility of increasing returns tends to rob economic models of two properties that economists simplicity and determinism.\\" This sentence states that when increasing returns (that is, a situation where the output increases more than proportionally to the input) are permitted in economic models, these models lose the properties of simplicity and determinism. In this context, simplicity means models that are easily understood and have fewer variables, whereas determinism refers to the predictability and certainty of outcomes within the model. Sentence 2: \\"Economists highly value simplicity and determinism above all else.\\" The second sentence implies that, to economists, the most important attributes of their models are simplicity and determinism. This statement purports that economists prioritize these factors over other potentially important qualities of their models. Given the truth of the first sentence, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the second sentence is also true. While the first sentence indicates that introducing the concept of increasing returns undermines the simplicity and determinism of economic models, it does not necessarily assert that economists prioritize these two properties above all else. Economists may indeed place importance on simplicity and determinism in their models, but there could be other aspects that they may also consider valuable, such as accuracy, adaptability, or the ability to respond to evolving market conditions. The first sentence does not provide enough information to ascertain whether these other factors are less significant to economists than simplicity and determinism, which would substantiate the second sentence being true. In conclusion, while the first sentence may have implications for the second sentence's proposition, it does not definitively confirm its truth. Further information or context regarding the priorities and preferences of economists when constructing economic models would be needed to establish the truth of the second sentence."},{"instruction":"What is the title of this article: Many annual events celebrate the diverse cultures of Houston.

(2) Sequence transformations that are not nonlinear are called linear sequence transformations . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Hello little buddy! Let's take a look at these two sentences and break them down so you can understand them better. 1. The first sentence says that when a sequence - transformation is not a straight line, we call it a nonlinear sequence - transformation. Imagine drawing squiggly lines instead of straight lines, that's what it means. 2. The second sentence says that when a sequence transformation is not squiggly, we call it a linear sequence transformation. So that would be like drawing straight lines. Now, let's see if they mean the same thing. The first sentence talks about squiggly lines, while the second one talks about straight lines. So, they are not exactly the same, but they are related. They describe two different types of transformations: one with squiggly lines (nonlinear) and one with straight lines (linear)."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Once a neighbour stole one of Washington's horses. Washington went with a police officer to the neighbour's farm to get the horse, but the neighbour refused to give the horse up; he claimed that it was his horse. Washington placed both of his hands over the eyes of the horse and said to the neighbour, \\"If this is your horse, then you must tell us in which eyes he is blind.\\" \\"In the right eye,\\" the neighbour said. Washington took his hand from the right eye of the horse and showed the police officer that the horse was not blind in the right eye. \\"Oh, I have made a mistake,\\" said the neighbor. \\"He is blind in the left eye.\\" Washington then showed that the horse was not blind in the left eye, either. \\"I have made another mistake,\\" said the neighbor. \\"Yes,\\" said the police officer, \\"and you have also proved that the horse does not belong to you. You must return it to Mr. Washington.\\" Question: From the passage, we know _ . Options: A: Washington was a wise man B: Washington's neighbor was cleverer than Washington C: the police officer was the cleverest of the three D: all the three men were not very clever The answer is:","output":"A: Washington was a wise man. The passage tells the story of how Washington dealt with a neighbor who had stolen one of his horses. It highlights Washington's wisdom and ability to think on his feet in a challenging situation. When the neighbor refused to return the horse, claiming it was his own, Washington devised a clever test to expose the neighbor's lie. By asking the neighbor to identify which eye the horse was blind in, Washington forced him to reveal that he did not know the horse well enough to be its true owner. Once the neighbor admitted to making a \\"mistake\\" and failed to identify the correct eye, the police officer was able to determine that the horse belonged to Washington and ordered the neighbor to return it. From the passage, we can clearly see that Washington was a wise man, as he was able to outsmart the neighbor and recover his stolen horse. On the other hand, the neighbor, who tried to lie and claim the horse as his own, was not cleverer than Washington, which eliminates option B. The police officer merely followed Washington's lead and enforced the law once the truth was revealed; there is no evidence to suggest that he was the cleverest of the three, making option C not valid. Lastly, the assertion that all three men were not very clever (option D) does not hold up since Washington's wisdom and problem-solving skills were demonstrated through his actions. Therefore, option A, which states that Washington was a wise man, is the best answer to the question based on the information provided in the passage."},{"instruction":"Question: Facts: - doublesrecord: 63 -- 117 - residence: collonges , france - singlesrecord: 182 -- 196 - doublestitles: 0 wta , 1 itf - usopenresult: q1 -lrb- 2006 -rrb- - plays: right-handed -lrb- two-handed backhand -rrb- - updated: 28 march 2011 - highestdoublesranking: no. 255 -lrb- 19 october 2009 -rrb- - grandslamsdoublesresults: yes - frenchopenresult: q2 -lrb- 2006 , 2007 -rrb- - singlestitles: 0 wta , 0 itf - highestsinglesranking: no. 213 -lrb- 26 june 2008 -rrb- - birth date: 02 october 1985 - frenchopendoublesresult: 1r -lrb- 2005 , 2006 , 2007 -rrb- - name: florence haring - birth place: geneva , switzerland - turnedpro: 2003 Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of florence haring .

Once again, the Raider offense struggled, not managing any points until the second quarter. The Denver offense looked good on its second possession of the game, moving 88 yards on seven plays and opening the scoring as Trevor Siemian hit A. J. Derby on a 22-yard pass and catch for a touchdown. Following a quick Raider possession and trailing 7-0, the Raider defense was able to limit Denver to a Brandon McManus 28-yard field goal, stopping the Broncos on the 79-yard drive. Finally, with 5:59 seconds remaining in the second quarter, the Raiders offense came alive. Beginning on their own one-yard line, the Raiders quickly moved out to their 36-yard line before Derek Carr hit Johnny Holton on a bomb for a 64-yard touchdown pass which brought the score to 10-7. The half ended with both offenses managing nothing further. The Raiders began the second half with the ball, but could not manage a first down again, punting the ball back to the Broncos. Denver capitalized, driving 55 yards before settling for another McManus field goal to move the score to 13-7. A three-and-out by the Raiders on their ensuing possession led to another McManus field goal which extended the Bronco lead to 16-7. Looking to close the gap, the Raiders again failed to manage a first down and attempted a fake punt from inside their own 35-yard line where punter Marquette King attempted to run for the first down, but was instead dropped for a three-yard loss. The Broncos failed to capitalize as McManus missed a 29-yard field goal. Derek Carr was sacked on the first play of the Raiders next possession and had to leave the game with a back injury. Backup quarterback EJ Manuel could not get a first down as the Raiders were forced to punt again with less than three minutes remaining in the third quarter. Neither team managed any points on their first possessors of the fourth quarter. With 8:30 remaining in the game, the Raiders went no huddle and EJ Manuel led the team down the field with five consecutive completions. However, the drive stalled and the Raiders were forced to settled for a Giorgio Tavecchio 38-yard field goal with 5:27 left in the game. The Raider defense forced Denver to punt and Manuel took over with 4:16 left in the game. Completing three of four passes, the Raiders moved to the Denver 41-yard line. However, Manuel's next pass was intercepted by the Broncos at the Denver eight-yard line with 1:46 remaining in the game to end the Raider comeback hopes. For the second consecutive week, the Raider offense struggled managing only 24 yards rushing while only putting up 249 yard through the air. The Raider defense played well limiting the Broncos to only 298 total yards.

The correct answer to the given question is B). Respiration. To provide a more detailed understanding, cellular respiration can be divided into four distinct stages: glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation (which includes the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis). 1. Glycolysis: This stage takes place in the cytoplasm of a cell, where one glucose molecule (a carbohydrate) is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This process generates a net production of two ATP molecules and two molecules of NADH, a high-energy electron carrier. Glycolysis occurs in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic conditions) and serves as the starting point for cellular respiration. 2. Pyruvate Oxidation: If oxygen is present, pyruvate molecules enter the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells or remain in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells to undergo further breakdown. During this process, each pyruvate molecule is converted into Acetyl CoA, releasing a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2) and generating an additional NADH molecule. Acetyl CoA then enters the citric acid cycle. 3. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle or TCA Cycle): This cyclic process takes place in the mitochondrial matrix (in eukaryotes) or the cytoplasm (in prokaryotes). Acetyl CoA combines with oxaloacetate, a four-carbon compound, to form citrate, a six-carbon compound. As citrate goes through a series of redox reactions, high-energy electron carriers (NADH and FADH2) are created, and two molecules of CO2 are released. For each Acetyl CoA that enters the cycle, one ATP molecule is produced. 4. Oxidative Phosphorylation: This stage involves the electron transport chain, which is a series of protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane (in eukaryotes) or plasma membrane (in prokaryotes). The high-energy electrons carried by NADH and FADH2 are transferred along the chain, releasing energy that drives the active transport of protons (H+ ions) across the membrane. This generates an electrochemical gradient, and the protons flow back into their original compartment (down the gradient) through an enzyme called ATP synthase. This process, called chemiosmosis, leads to the production of most ATP generated during cellular respiration (approximately 32 to 34 ATP molecules). In summary, cellular respiration is an essential process that allows cells to generate ATP efficiently, supporting various cellular functions and activities. The answer to the given question is B). Respiration."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a conversation between two people. 'Person1:' and 'Person2:' are used to separate their respective dialogues.

The main goal is to provide safety and containment without obstructing the aesthetics of the property. There are two main types of invisible fences: wired and wireless. Each has its pros and cons, which we will discuss to determine the better solution based on various factors, such as ease of installation, coverage area, reliability, cost, and flexibility. 1. Wired Invisible Fence: In a wired invisible fence system, a cable is buried around the perimeter of the desired containment area, which will transmit a radio signal to the pet's collar. When the pet approaches the boundary, their collar will receive a signal that triggers either an audible warning followed by a mild static correction, or a vibration, depending on the system setup. Pros: - Customizable: A wired system allows for greater flexibility in shaping the containment area and can be adjusted to include or exclude specific areas, such as gardens or pools. - Large area coverage: Wired systems can cover larger areas, usually up to 25 acres or more, depending on the length of the wire used. - More reliable: Wired systems tend to have fewer interference issues compared to wireless systems. Cons: - Installation: Installing a wired system requires burying the wire around the desired perimeter, which can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. - Maintenance: Wired systems are susceptible to wire breaks due to digging, weather, or other factors, which may require additional maintenance and repair. - Cost: Although wired fence components may not be as expensive, factors like installation and additional landscaping may contribute to a higher overall cost. 2. Wireless Invisible Fence: In a wireless system, a transmitter sends a radio signal in a circular radius to define the containment area's perimeter. When the pet reaches the boundary, a signal is sent to their collar, producing an audible warning followed by a mild static correction or vibration. Pros: - Ease of installation: Wireless systems are faster and easier to install because there is no need to bury a cable. The transmitter just needs power and a place free from obstructions. - Portability: Wireless systems can be moved and reinstalled easily, making them suitable for renters or those who need to shift the containment area frequently. - No maintenance: Wireless systems do not involve wires or cables, so they do not require repairing broken wires or additional maintenance. Cons: - Less customizable: Wireless systems offer limited customization options. Boundary shapes are limited to a circle, and it's more challenging to exclude certain areas within the containment area. - Smaller coverage area: Wireless systems generally cover smaller areas, with many models only providing coverage up to 1 to 2 acres. - Interference: Wireless systems are more likely to be affected by interference from metal objects, walls, or other electronic devices, potentially impacting the reliability of the system. When evaluating the above factors for the goal of having an effective and aesthetically pleasing invisible fence, the best solution depends on your specific needs and circumstances. - If you require a larger containment area or wish to customize the shape and size of your containment zone, a wired system would be the better option due to its adaptability and reliability. - If ease of installation, portability, and low maintenance are your priorities and you can work within the limitations of a circular containment area, a wireless system might be the better choice. It is important to take into consideration your property size, landscape, and desired containment area shape when selecting the most suitable invisible fence solution. Additionally, remember to consider any interference factors, potential maintenance, and whether or not you anticipate needing to relocate the system in the future. Ultimately, the better solution will be the one that best meets your specific requirements and preferences for an invisible fence."},{"instruction":"What is an example of a tweet?","output":"In order to create an example of a tweet, I will think of a relevant and concise message that can be shared within the 280-character limit on Twitter.

The answer is:","output":"Alexandre Aja"},{"instruction":"Information: - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it be a business, a not-for-profit organization, or government body. Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees or volunteers to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources. The term \\"management\\" may also refer to the people who manage an organization. - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America. - A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of \\"breeds\\" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset. - <onlyinclude> Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. (Veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition.)</onlyinclude> - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a \\"system of money\\" (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation. Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance. - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - In economics, products can be classified into goods and services. Goods are items that are tangible, such as books, pens, salt, shoes, hats and folders. Services are activities provided by other people, such as doctors, lawn care workers, dentists, barbers, waiters, or online servers. According to economic theory, consumption of goods and services is assumed to provide utility (satisfaction) to the consumer or end-user, although businesses also consume goods and services in the course of producing other goods and services. - Port-Margot is a commune in the Borgne Arrondissement, in the Nord Department of Haiti. It has 36,937 inhabitants. - The Caribbean Sea is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere. It is bounded by Mexico and Central America to the west and south west, to the north by the Greater Antilles starting with Cuba, to the east by the Lesser Antilles, and to the south by the north coast of South America. - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - The history of agriculture records the domestication of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. - A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and anaerobic digestion, rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter. Biofuels can be derived directly from plants, or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes. Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation, such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of biomass (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels. - Borgne is an arrondissement in the Nord Department of Haiti. It has 83,823 inhabitants. Postal codes in the Borgne Arrondissement start with the number 15. - Hispaniola (Spanish: \\"La Española\\"; Latin: \\"Hispaniola\\"; Taíno: \\"Haiti\\") is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the tenth most populous island in the world. - Medicinal plants have been identified and used throughout human history. Plants make many chemical compounds that are for biological functions, including defence against insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total. Chemical compounds in plants mediate their effect on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to have beneficial pharmacology, but also gives them the same potential as conventional pharmaceutical drugs to cause harmful side effects. Moreover, plant material comes with a variety of compounds which may have undesired effects, though these can be reduced by processing. - An economy (From Greek \\"household\\" and o \\"manage\\") is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and consumption of goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency, but monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic domain. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Haiti , officially the Republic of Haiti, is a sovereign state located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea. It occupies the western three-eighths of the island, which it shares with the Dominican Republic. Haiti is in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole. - The Greater Antilles is a grouping of the larger islands in the Caribbean Sea: Cuba, Hispaniola (containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands. The Greater Antilles constitute over 90% of the land mass of the entire West Indies, as well as over 90% of its population, with the balance made of the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, which is a chain of islands to the east (running north-south and encompassing the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean) and south (running east-west off the northern coast of South America). - Borgne ( Haitian Creole : Obòy ) is a commune in the north coast of Haiti , west of Cap - Haïtien and northwest of Limbé , in Nord Department .

Satellite view of Borgne - Monoculture is the agricultural practice of producing or growing a single crop, plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time. Polyculture, where more than one crop is grown in the same space at the same time, is the alternative to monoculture. Monoculture is widely used in both industrial farming and organic farming and has allowed increased efficiency in planting and harvest. - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market. - A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism. - Fond La Grange is a village near Borgne, Haiti. A hospital is located there. The hospital is run by the Alyans Sante Borgne, a partnership between the nongovernmental organization H.O.P.E.

Joe Nolan (Cesar Romero) is the head of an expedition to the South Pacific to retrieve an atomic-powered rocket that vanished without a trace. He had previously lived in a South American jungle, as has fellow serviceman and pilot Lt. Danny Wilson (Chick Chandler), who is also on the expedition. Aircraft mechanic Sgt. William Tatlow (Sid Melton) is also recruited for the expedition, which includes the three scientists who helped build the rocket. Their transport aircraft mysteriously crash-lands on a remote, unknown tropical island in the area where the rocket was lost on radar. They find only two occupants left on the island, a native woman (Acquanetta) and her young brother. The woman indicates something fell from the sky atop a forbidding, cloud-shrouded plateau that dominates part of the island. The rocket's fiery arrival caused the rest of the native population to abandon the island. Expedition member Stanley Briggs (Whit Bissell) is accidentally killed on the steep ascent of the escarpment. After long stretches of tedious rock climbing, the expedition finally closes in on the top. Emerging from what turns out to be a toxic gas cloud cover, they discover a lush, prehistoric jungle inhabited by various dinosaurs and a large field of uranium, which is what has disabled their electronic tracking equipment. The group comes upon a Brontosaurus, which then attacks Robert Phillips (Hugh Beaumont) as he quickly retreats up a tree. This results in Nolan and Wilson shooting at it, but they quickly discover that the dinosaur's thick hide absorbs bullets with little effect. Later that night they set up camp. When Nolan wakes up, he finds Phillips and Russian scientist Michael Rostov (John Hoyt) gone. He then discovers that Rostov got himself stuck in a large rock near a Triceratops; he accuses Phillips of arranging the accident on purpose, but Rostov insists that he tried to help Phillips escape.

Options: - shortness of breath - weight loss - faster travel - stitches - heart attack Reasoning process:","output":"People take up running primarily for the purpose of weight loss. Let's analyze each option in detail to arrive at the conclusion: 1. Shortness of breath: Shortness of breath is a symptom that can occur during physical exertion, such as running, but it is not a reason why people would take up running. People with shortness of breath might actually avoid running due to the potential for discomfort. 2. Weight loss: Running is known to be an effective exercise for burning calories, which can help individuals achieve their weight loss goals. Many people take up running as a way to maintain a healthier lifestyle, improve their cardiovascular fitness, and shed excess pounds. Additionally, running is a cost-effective and convenient way to exercise, as it requires minimal equipment and can be done in nearly any outdoor setting. 3. Faster travel: While running allows a person to travel faster than walking, it usually isn't the most convenient mode of transportation for daily purposes, especially over long distances or when carrying items. People generally utilize cars, bikes, public transit, or other methods to travel efficiently. 4. Stitches: Stitches are a sudden, sharp, localized pain in the abdomen, which can occur during activities such as running. They are not a reason why people take up running, as they are generally considered to be a discomfort that one wants to avoid while engaging in physical activities. 5. Heart attack: Running does not cause heart attacks. In fact, engaging in regular physical activity, including running, can lower the risk of many health problems like heart diseases. However, people who have recently experienced a heart attack or have pre-existing heart conditions should consult their doctors before starting any exercise regimen, including running. Based on the reasoning above, people primarily take up running for the purpose of weight loss, as it is an accessible, cost-effective, and efficient way to burn calories and improve overall health."},{"instruction":"Он отбыл семь лет из назначенного ему 10-летнего срока лишения свободы, проведя большую его часть в одиночном заключении.

Guests staying at Plaza Hotel will be given meat tickets worth 36 once they have produced 10 watt hours of electricity. The bicycles will have smart phones attached to the handlebars measuring how much power is being generated for the hotel. The plan, a world-first, will start on 19 April and run for a year. Only guests staying at the hotel will be able to take part. Frederikke Toemmergaard, hotel spokeswoman, said, \\"Many of our visitors are business people who enjoy going to the gym.

Dean, however, took active steps in helping the growth of AM fungi so he grew cover crops on his lands. Which farmer didn't increase the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop? Hint: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.","output":"To determine which farmer didn't increase the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop, let's compare the actions of both farmers and consider the information provided in the hint. 1.

After being denied entrance to the Coco Bongo, he finds a wooden mask near the city's harbor.

We know that pens, specifically fountain pens, utilize ink to write, as ink travels from a reservoir or cartridge and onto the paper. Ballpoint pens also contain ink, even though they don't technically \\"absorb\\" it. In general, this statement makes sense because pens rely on ink to write. 2. Sentence B: \\"Pencils need to absorb ink before they are used.\\" - This sentence states that pencils require the absorption of ink prior to use. Pencils, however, are designed to utilize graphite or a similar substance for their writing core, not ink. Pencils do not require ink for writing, and thus, this statement does not make sense.

Step 3: After gathering all the necessary materials, Joseph meticulously organized his portfolio. He decided to place the project near the beginning to catch the attention of potential clients, showcasing his versatility and ability to meet various clients' needs. Step 4: Joseph presented the project as a case study at a local architectural meetup. By sharing his experience and insights with fellow architects, he helped foster an environment of collaborative learning and raised awareness about the importance of client-focused design. Step 5: Over time, the house gained recognition in architectural circles, leading to an increase in demand for Joseph's services.

Sentence 2: If this were a show on television, I could just run a bunch of thank you credits and you would probably just ignore them. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Both sentences convey the idea that if the current situation were a TV show, the speaker could present a long list of thank-yous (in the form of credits), which the listener would most likely ignore. However, there are subtle differences between the two sentences in terms of language and tone. In the first sentence, the phrase \\"I could run a long list of thank-yous that you'd ignore\\" implies that the speaker is acknowledging the probability that the listener isn't fully interested in the credits or thank-yous. The addition of \\"on your way to the kitchen for another beer\\" suggests a nonchalant tone and common everyday behavior, showing that the speaker is aware of the casual nature of the situation. The second sentence states a similar idea but with a slightly different tone. The phrase \\"I could just run a bunch of thank you credits\\" has a somewhat dismissive tone - it minimizes the importance of the thank-yous by using the word \\"just,\\" as if to suggest that it's not a big deal. In addition, \\"you would probably just ignore them\\" demonstrates an understanding that the listener's indifference is expected or even acceptable. So, while the main idea in both sentences is the same - if it were a TV show, the speaker would present thank-yous which the listener would likely ignore - the way that the idea is expressed is slightly different. Nonetheless, these differences in tone and language do not change the fact that the second sentence is indeed entailed by the first sentence."},{"instruction":"Premise: Thank you. Hypothesis: Thankyou very much. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Alright, let me explain this in a simple way. A premise is a statement that helps us understand an idea, while a hypothesis is an idea that we are trying to test or figure out. When we say \\"entail,\\" we mean that one statement logically leads to another statement. In this case, the premise is your way of saying, \\"Thank you.\\" The hypothesis is another way of expressing thanks: \\"Thank you very much.\\" The two statements are similar and both show gratitude, but one is not enough to cause or prove the other.

Over millions of years, as climates change and mountains rise, new dry and wet areas appear. But within the last hundred years deserts have been increasing after frightful speed. This is partly because of natural changes, but most responsible for creating deserts are men. Man can make deserts, but they can also prevent them from getting bigger. Algeria is planning a green belt of trees along the edge of the Sahara Desert to stop the sand. In China, too, _ are being built in the northwest to keep the desert from growing. But desert still threaten the world. Experts believe that land that is on the way to becoming deserts equals the size of Australia, Russia and US put together. Can we stop the spread of the world's deserts and save the land that is so essential to mankind? Yes, we can, and we must. Answer:","output":"Which of the following best represents the main idea expressed in the article? A) Deserts have been decreasing in size over millions of years due to climatic changes. B) The desertification process is a natural occurrence that cannot be interfered with by human activity. C) Man-made actions contribute significantly to the growth of deserts, but efforts are being made to prevent further desertification. D) The world's deserts are primarily located in Australia, Russia, and the United States. The correct answer is C) Man-made actions contribute significantly to the growth of deserts, but efforts are being made to prevent further desertification. Even though the article mentions the change in the size and location of the world’s deserts due to natural causes such as climatic changes (refuting option A), it strongly emphasizes the role of human activities in accelerating this pace over the past century. The text also highlights efforts made by countries like Algeria and China to curb the growth of deserts through reforestation in the form of green belts and other afforestation projects (proving option C). Option B) is incorrect because the article indicates that human intervention can potentially slow down or prevent desertification, contrary to the suggestion that it's an uncontrollable natural process. Finally, option D) is not the main idea of the article. Although the text does mention that land areas under risk of desertification are equivalent in size to Australia, Russia, and the United States combined, this information is used for emphasis rather than being the central theme of the article."},{"instruction":"Mutta kansanterveyspolitiikkaa kehitettäessä on monia kysymyksiä, joita on käsiteltävä ja tarkasteltava huolellisesti.

However, the detailed articulation and support for this model came much later through the works of Nicolaus Copernicus, a 16th-century Polish astronomer and mathematician. At the time Aristarchus theorized the heliocentric model, the widely accepted model was the geocentric model, which puts the Earth at the center of the universe, proposed by Claudius Ptolemy, an ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician. Ptolemy's model dominated the astronomical world for over a thousand years, but as more accurate astronomical observations were made, the model started to show inconsistencies. Again, it was Nicolaus Copernicus who re-evaluated the heliocentric idea with better mathematical and theoretical foundations. In his magnum opus \\"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\\" (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) published in 1543, Copernicus presented a detailed model of the solar system with the Sun at the center and the planets, including Earth, orbiting around it. Copernicus' work was a major breakthrough in the field of astronomy and laid the groundwork for future advancements in understanding our solar system's structure and organization. Copernicus' heliocentric model faced resistance from those who held onto the geocentric view, especially among religious scholars who believed that the Earth's central position reflected its importance in the universe. However, the heliocentric model eventually gained momentum, supported by the works of other great astronomers and mathematicians such as Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Sir Isaac Newton. The heliocentric view was further strengthened and solidified as more precise measurements and observations were made, ultimately leading to the widespread acceptance of the Sun as the center of the solar system."},{"instruction":"Student: Given the sentence \\"The snowboarder is ready to jump.\\" is it true that \\"The snowboarder is competing in a snowboarding competition.\\"?.

Introduced in the southeast to help control weeds and parasites in aquaculture operations, these fish soon spread up the Mississippi River system where they have been crowding out native fish populations not used to competing with such aggressive invaders. The carps' presence in such numbers is also harming water quality and killing off sensitive species. Asian carp are strong to jump over barriers such as low dams. They lay hundreds of thousands of eggs at a time and spread into new habitat quickly and easily. Also, flooding has helped the fish expand into previously unattainable water bodies. And fishers using young carp as live bait have also helped the fish's spread, as they have boats going through locks up and down the Mississippi. The federal government considers the Asian carps to be annoying species and encourages and supports \\"active control\\" by natural resources management agencies. Federal and state governments have spent millions in tax dollars to prevent the carp from making their way into the Great Lakes, but an underwater electric fence constructed to keep them out has not worked as well as hoped, and policymakers are reviewing other options now. In the meantime, state and federal agencies are monitoring the Mississippi and its branches for Asian carp and testing various barrier technologies to prevent their further spread. For instance, the National Park Service is cooperating with the state of Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources to construct new dams that are high enough to prevent Asian carp from jumping over. The Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee has funded DNA monitoring in potentially affected water bodies whereby researchers can determine whether the troublesome fish are present just by the biological footprints they leave behind....

Article: When you consider what subject to study in college, chances are that you and your parents will think about what you can make out of _ after graduation. You will likely ask the question: \\"Can I find a well-paid job or simply a job with a degree in this in the future?\\" This consideration also influences students when they come to choose between studying science or humanities at college. People generally believe that the humanities, which include literature , history, cultural studies and philosophy, do not prepare students for a specific vocation . Science subjects, however, are considered vocational courses that produce scientists, engineers and economists . \\"I've decided to take finance as my college major. My parents and I think this subject will help me get a good job or start a business,\\" said Huachen Yueru, 17, a science student at Wuxi No. 1 High School. Even those who choose a liberal arts education often pick the humanities subject which they think will best help them later find a job. \\"I'm going to study Spanish in college, which I believe will open doors to a high-paying job for me,\\" said Liu Chao, 18, a Senior 2 student at Dalian No 20 High School. He said few of his classmates show interest in subjects like philosophy and history, which are seen as \\"less promising\\" in job markets. The popularity of liberal arts subjects among college students has also been decreasing in the United States. American scholars and universities are concerned that in the ongoing economic crisis liberal arts subjects will be hit hardest. As money tightens , they worry that the humanities may become \\"a great luxury that many cannot afford\\", according to the New York Times. Question: What can we infer from the passage ? Answer: Answer:","output":"We can infer from the passage that the choice of subjects to study in college is heavily influenced by the perceived potential for future job prospects and financial stability. Students and their parents often gravitate towards science-related subjects, viewing them as more vocational and likely to lead to careers as scientists, engineers, or economists. On the other hand, humanities subjects like literature, history, cultural studies, and philosophy are considered less practical and less promising in terms of future employment opportunities. We can also infer that even within the humanities, students tend to choose subjects they think will be most helpful in securing a well-paying job after graduation, such as learning a foreign language like Spanish in the case of Liu Chao. It is evident that many students may not prioritize subjects like philosophy and history out of concerns about their marketability in the job market. Moreover, the passage suggests that there is a growing concern among American scholars and universities that the popularity of liberal arts subjects is declining. As a result of the economic crisis and tightening financial situations, there is a fear that humanities courses may become too costly and perceived as luxuries, further exacerbating the decline in interest in these subjects. In conclusion, the passage highlights how the predominant factor influencing students' choice of subjects to study in college is the potential for future job prospects and financial security. This has led to an inclination towards science-related subjects and a decline in the popularity of humanities subjects, raising concerns about the future of liberal arts education and its perceived value."},{"instruction":"Write the last sentence in this story.

In so mancher Rezension über \\"Return to Childhood\\" wird behauptet, Fish sei noch immer so gut bei Stimme wie vor 20 Jahren, als Marillion mit \\"Misplaced Childhood\\" ihre größten Erfolge feierten. Das ist leider nicht im Mindesten wahr. Tatsächlich werden die gesanglichen Fähigkeiten von Fish seit über 10 Jahren zunehmend schlechter, was nicht nur die Live-Alben des Künsters belegen, sondern sich mittleriweile sogar aus den Studioaufnahmen heraushören lässt. \\"Return to Childhood\\" gibt hier nur ein weiteres, bedrückendes Beispiel dafür ab. Fishs Stimme klingt erschöpft und völlig heiser und er erreicht keine hohen Stimmlagen mehr. Dementsprechend wird auf der aktuellen Live-CD z.B. Kayleigh, der größte Marillion-Hit, in einer deutlich niedrigeren Tonlage gespielt, damit Fish den Song einigermaßen singen kann. Darüber hinaus singt eine Backgroundsängerin einen großen Teil der Songs zur Unterstützung mit. Es ist darum um so bedauerlicher, dass so manche Marillion-Fans der ersten stunde dem Nachfolger von Fish bei Marillion, Steve Hogarth, nie eine Chance gegeben haben, denn der ist noch heute ein herausragender Sänger, ganz davon abgesehen, dass Marillion noch heute musikalisch relevante großartige Alben produzieren, was man von Fishs Soloalben meistens nicht behaupten kann. So bliebt denn auch ein fader Beigeschmack, dass sich Fish nun durch die 20jährige Jubiläumstour zu Misplaced Childhood auf die erfolgreiche Vergangenheit beziehen muss, um mehr Aufmerksamkeit zu erzielen. Dabei lässt \\"Return to Childhood\\" musikalisch nicht viel zu wünschen übrig. Der Sound ist sehr gut und die Begleitband ist hervorragend. Der Einsatz von zwei Gitarristen zahlt sich positiv aus und verleiht vielen der alten Songs, die ja nur für eine Gitarre bestimmt waren, ein paar neue Facette. Über die Songauswahl der ersten CD, die Songs aus Fish Solojahren präsentiert, kann man streiten, man hätte sich vielleicht ein paar andere Songs gewünscht. Es bleibt aber die Enttäuschung über die gesangliche Leistung von Fish. Wenn man sich anhört, wie das 1988 auf der Live-CD \\"The Thieving Magpie\\" klang, auf der Misplaced Childhood ebenfalls komplett enthalten ist, kann man über \\"Return to Childhood\\" wahrlich nicht begeistert sein. Output:","output":"NEG Step-by-step justification: 1. The reviewer starts by expressing disappointment (\\"Enttäuschend\\"). 2. The reviewer states that the claims regarding Fish's voice are not true. 3. The reviewer points out that Fish's singing abilities have been getting worse over the last 10 years. 4. The reviewer criticizes the live performance of the song \\"Kayleigh,\\" saying that it is played in a lower pitch and the background singer had to help with the vocals. 5.

Article: Prejudice is a preconceived opinion that is not based on fact or reason. Examples of prejudice in schools include believing that some students are particular type of people simply because of the way they dress or act, or believing that a certain group is good at sports simply because many peop1e in that group are goad at sports. Another example is believing that a boy is good at science because many boys are good at science. I would like to cite more examples from the English literature. The best example of \\"prejudice\\" can be found in Jane Austen's novels. Her novels in the history of English literature are popularly known as \\"novels of manners\\".Thus you can clearly understand that where manners and social behavior are concerned,\\"prejudice\\" is inevitable ! Austen' s famous novel Pride and Prejudice is the best example in this respect. When you read the novel, the very first line that would strike you is \\"it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\"It is an example of 18th century English middle class prejudice that eventually looked upon women just as an object that would serve as the basic sign for a man to establish his manliness and his superior and well acquired financial status. This novel is chiefly about class division,social norms and the consequent human behavior.

A: pick from the following. -- limiting. -- pushing. -- division. -- favoring. A:","output":"To answer this multiple choice question, I'll need to consider the options in relation to the context of the question, which is about the process when the speed of a reaction is increased until equilibrium is established. So, I'll examine each option one by one. Option 1: Limiting - This term is often used in chemistry, but it refers to the limiting reagent, which is the reactant that gets completely consumed in a reaction and determines the maximum amount of product that can be formed. This doesn't seem to fit the described process. Option 2: Pushing - This term doesn't have a specific definition in this context, but it's not typically used to refer to the process of achieving equilibrium in chemistry. So, this might not be the right answer. Option 3: Division - This isn't a term typically associated with reaction rate or equilibrium in chemistry. Division usually means the process of dividing or the state of being divided, which doesn't fit with the question. Option 4: Favoring - This term often used in equilibrium to denote the direction in which a reaction is more likely to proceed. But, it doesn't suggest the act of speeding up a reaction until equilibrium is achieved. Upon considering each of the options, it appears that none of the provided answer choices directly applies to the process described in the question. Achieving equilibrium more quickly by speeding up the reaction is typically associated with catalysis in chemistry. Catalysts are substances that can increase the speed of a reaction and thus help achieve equilibrium more quickly without themselves being consumed in the reaction. Unfortunately, this term isn't an option. For this reason, based on the given options, it's difficult to choose a most suitable term."},{"instruction":"Please answer a question about the following article about Culture: In 1860, Adolf Bastian (1826–1905) argued for \\"the psychic unity of mankind\\".

Answer the above question based on the context below: Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not \\"breed\\" their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of houseborn slaves appears to have been rather large in Ptolemaic Egypt and in manumission inscriptions at Delphi. Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of African slaves in the American South on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply.Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that \\"…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.\\" The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.Houseborn slaves (oikogeneis) often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were \\"pedagogues\\" in the first sense of the term. Some of them were the offspring of the master of the house, but in most cities, notably Athens, a child inherited the status of its mother.

These levels are often calculated based on various time zones to better understand the underlying momentum and sentiment across different trading sessions. Time zones play a crucial role in these calculations as they help in identifying the open, high, low, and close prices for each session. Here's a detailed explanation of how to calculate pivot and similar levels based on time zones. 1. Identifying Time Zones: The first step is to determine the time zones that you want to use for your calculations. The most common time zones used by traders include the Sydney, Tokyo, London, and New York sessions. Each session has a distinct trading window, during which significant market moves and events take place. Therefore, it's essential to be aware of the trading hours for these sessions and convert them into your local time for accurate calculations. 2. Collecting Data: After identifying the time zones, the next step is to gather the necessary data, including the open, high, low, and close prices for each trading session. This data can be extracted from various sources such as trading platforms, financial news websites, or market data providers. 3. Calculating Pivot Points: Once you have the relevant data, you can calculate the pivot points (PP) for each session using the following formula: Pivot Point (PP) = (High + Low + Close) / 3 This calculation will help you to identify the central pivot point, which serves as a consensus of value for the market and provides a reference point for other support and resistance levels. 4. Calculating Support and Resistance Levels: To calculate support and resistance levels, you'll need to use the pivot point as a base. Support levels are calculated using the following formulas: Support 1 (S1) = (2 * Pivot Point) - High Support 2 (S2) = Pivot Point - (High - Low) Resistance levels, on the other hand, are calculated using these formulas: Resistance 1 (R1) = (2 * Pivot Point) - Low Resistance 2 (R2) = Pivot Point + (High - Low) 5. Analyzing the Results: Once you have calculated all the necessary levels, you can plot them on your trading chart to identify potential trading opportunities, reversals, or breakouts. These levels can help you make informed trading decisions, set potential entry and exit points, and manage your risk-reward ratio more effectively. In summary, calculating pivot and similar levels based on time zones is an essential step in understanding market dynamics across different trading sessions. By identifying the most relevant time zones, collecting the necessary data, and following the proper calculations for pivot points and support and resistance levels, you can gain valuable insights that will improve your trading strategies and overall success in the market."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

A few hours later government seismologist Dr. Amy Lane arrives at the quake's epicenter. She realizes that the quake has opened a deep fault running through the center of North America, ending at the San Andreas Fault. Any further instability will cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis, devastating Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities all around the Pacific Ocean, leading to the deaths of millions. Dr. Lane and Boomer chase just behind the expanding crack in the Earth's crust, developing a plan to stop the next quake.

They fire it off when they reach the Grand Canyon, thinking that when the new fault hits the canyon it will be forced to turn south into the Gulf of Mexico. When the fault crosses with the canyon, the plan goes wrong. Instead of heading south it travels north, towards the Yellowstone Caldera. They realize that if the fault crosses with the caldera it would erupt, expelling 2,000,000 tons of ash into the atmosphere, killing millions immediately and causing a Volcanic winter.

Final closing arguments having been presented, a visibly bored judge instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder. If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jury retires to a private room, where the jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion with the sole exception of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), who is the only \\"not guilty\\" vote in a preliminary tally. He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first. His vote annoys the other jurors, especially Juror 7 (Jack Warden), who has tickets to a baseball game that evening; and Juror 10 (Ed Begley Sr.), who believes that people from slum backgrounds are liars, wild, and dangerous.The rest of the film's focus is the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices, Juror 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial, and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation.

Translate this to English?","output":"I am convinced that the unity of Europe can be strengthened by the economic growth of Europe. This statement expresses the belief that the unity among European countries can be reinforced by improving and increasing the region's overall economic growth. The concept of European unity is often associated with the European Union (EU), a political and economic union of 27 European countries established to facilitate cooperation and integration among its members. By focusing on economic growth, the statement implies that the prosperity generated by a thriving and expanding economic environment can lead to increased stability, cooperation, and shared goals among the EU member states. When the economies of these countries are growing and performing well, their general welfare improves – this, in turn, can contribute to a more cohesive and united Europe. There are several ways that economic growth can strengthen the unity of Europe: 1. Improved economic conditions create more opportunities for trade and investments. As European countries maintain strong economies, they are more inclined to import goods and services from one another, promoting collaboration and interdependence among their markets. 2. Economic growth can lead to increased employment opportunities and improved standards of living. This encourages the flow of skilled workers within the European region, which fosters collaboration among member states and a shared understanding of regional priorities and challenges. 3. Stronger European economies can make the region more attractive to outside investors and businesses. This helps unify Europe's global standing and enhances its overall influence on the international stage. 4. Economic growth can also benefit European countries in terms of funding. With enhanced revenues, governments in the region can invest in various initiatives – from infrastructure development and research to social programs – designed to improve the well-being of their people and create a more united Europe. 5. Financial stability reduces the likelihood of economic crises in the region. Crises can lead to nationalistic and protectionist policy choices, which can strain relationships among European countries. By maintaining steady economic growth, the EU can foster a sense of stability and unity among its members. In conclusion, the belief that the unity of Europe can be strengthened by the economic growth of the region highlights the importance of stable and prosperous economies in promoting collaboration, shared understanding, and mutual support among European countries. By focusing on economic development, the EU and its member states can work towards achieving a more cohesive and resilient Europe."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Flock of Dodos examines the disagreements that proponents of intelligent design have with the scientific consensus position of evolution.[1] The evolutionarily famous dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is a now-extinct bird that lived on the island of Mauritius. Due to its lack of fear of humans and inability to fly, the dodo was easy prey, and thus became known for its apparent stupidity. The film attempts to determine who the real \\"dodos\\" are in a constantly evolving world: the scientists who are failing to effectively promote evolution as a scientifically accepted fact, the intelligent design advocates, or the American public who get fooled by the \\"salesmanship\\" of evolution critics. The film gives equal air time to both sides of the argument, including intelligent design proponent Michael Behe and several of his colleagues. While Randy Olson ultimately sides with the scientists who accept evolution, the scientists are criticized for their elitism and inability to efficiently present science to the general public, which ultimately contributes to the spread of misconceptions.[2] The film begins by going over the history of intelligent design thought from Plato and Paley to the present-day incarnation promoted by the Discovery Institute. Olson mixes in humorous cartoons of squawking dodos with commentary from his mother and interviews with proponents on both sides of the intelligent design/evolution debate. On the intelligent design side, Olson interviews Behe, John Calvart (founder of the Access Research Network) and a member of the Kansas school board.[3] Olson also unsuccessfully tries to interview Kansas Board of Education member Connie Morris (associated with Kansas evolution hearings) and members of the Discovery Institute. The answer to this question is:","output":"What factors contribute to the ongoing debate between proponents of intelligent design and the scientific consensus on evolution, and how does the documentary \\"Flock of Dodos\\" explore the role of scientists, intelligent design advocates, and the American public in perpetuating misconceptions about evolution?"},{"instruction":"У этого были как положительная, так и отрицательная стороны.

The club is a member of both the Rugby Football Union and the Scottish Rugby Union. The club shares the Athletic Ground with Richmond. - The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU), or \\"Aonadh Rugbaidh na h-Alba\\" in Scottish Gaelic, is the governing body of rugby union in Scotland. It is the second oldest Rugby Union, having been founded in 1873, as the Scottish Football Union. The SRU oversees the national league system, known as the Scottish League Championship. The SRU is headed by the President (Ed Crozier) and Chairman (Sir Moir Lockhead), with Mark Dodson acting as the Chief Executive Officer. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line. - William Edward \`\` Bill '' Maclagan ( 5 April 1858 -- 10 October 1926 ) was a Scottish international rugby union forward who played club rugby for London Scottish F.C. .

A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey. - A try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football. A try is scored by grounding the ball (the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground) in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining 'grounding the ball' and the 'in-goal' area. - The Rugby Football Union (RFU) is the governing body for rugby union in England. It was founded in 1871, and was the sport's international governing body prior to the formation of what is now known as World Rugby (WR) in 1886.

Chinese cuisine has a rich history and is known for its diversity in flavors and ingredients. The introduction of Chinese cuisine to the United States can be traced back to the 19th century when Chinese immigrants arrived in the country, particularly in California, during the Gold Rush era. Over time, the popularity of Chinese cuisine has grown significantly, and it has become an integral part of American food culture. In the United States, Chinese cuisine has evolved and adapted to suit local tastes, giving birth to new and unique dishes. For instance, American Chinese cuisine typically uses ingredients that are readily available in the country, such as broccoli, carrots, and onions. Some well-known American Chinese dishes include Chop Suey, Orange Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, and Sesame Chicken. The Chinese food enjoyed in the United States, however, often differs from authentic Chinese cuisine found in China. The dishes served in American Chinese restaurants are generally milder, sweeter, and more heavily seasoned with sauces compared to those found in traditional Chinese restaurants in China. Additionally, these dishes often cater to American taste preferences, incorporating more deep-fried and meat-heavy options. Nonetheless, the United States also offers an array of authentic Chinese dishes that reflect regional Chinese cuisines. For example, the city of San Francisco is home to one of the oldest and most well-known Chinatowns in America, where you can experience the flavors and textures of Cantonese, Sichuan, Hunan, Shanghai, and Northern Chinese cuisines. Larger American cities, such as New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, also boast thriving Chinese communities with a variety of restaurants that specialize in regional Chinese delicacies. In conclusion, the translation of \\"Cocina china en Estados Unidos\\" is \\"Chinese cuisine in the United States\\". While American Chinese cuisine features dishes tailored to local tastes, you can still find a wide variety of authentic Chinese dishes from different regions of China in many American cities. Over the years, Chinese cuisine has become a beloved staple in the United States, sharing its rich and diverse culinary traditions with a broader audience."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question From the fifth-generation iPod on, Apple introduced a user-configurable volume limit in response to concerns about hearing loss.

The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones.

The answer is:","output":"Insects want to be pollinators because they receive benefits from the pollination process, primarily in the form of energy-rich nectar. This symbiotic relationship between insects and plants is a prime example of mutualism, where both parties benefit. Plants rely on pollinators, mainly insects, to transfer pollen in order to facilitate fertilization and sexual reproduction. Insects, on the other hand, are attracted to flowers through their bright colors (including ultraviolet) and alluring pheromones. Over time, different flower traits (and their combinations) have evolved to specifically attract certain pollinators, leading to various pollination syndromes that result from these complex plant-animal adaptations.

Seven years after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac drew anger for their role in the nation’s financial collapse, the agency that oversees them said Tuesday that it wants to let their chief executives bust through their 600,000 salary cap. The proposal comes while Fannie and Freddie’s independent regulator is still considering how to run the government-controlled housing giants over the long term, with no sign yet from Congress on their ultimate fate. But the possibility of CEO pay raises is already drawing criticism from Capitol Hill and resistance from the White House — and putting Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mel Watt in an awkward position less than a year and a half after he took over. Story Continued Below Nobody expected that the two mortgage titans would still be around so long after the government took them over at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Watt says Fannie and Freddie’s CEO pay structure needs a makeover, in part to keep the chief executives from bolting and to better plan for their replacements should they choose to leave, Freddie Mac disclosed in a financial filing Tuesday. Watt told Freddie and Fannie’s boards to limit any changes so that the CEOs’ pay would be within the bottom 25 percent of the market and would exclude bonuses. But executive pay at bailed-out banks and the housing finance giants became an explosive issue after the crisis and remains politically touchy. In 2012, the FHFA capped Fannie and Freddie CEO pay at 600,000 a year after Congress howled at lucrative pay packages being doled out. That cap is a far cry from the 2011 levels, when Freddie Mac’s then-CEO Ed Haldeman made 3.8 million and Fannie Mae’s then-CEO Michael Williams made 5.3 million. It’s not clear how big the raises would be, or when Freddie and Fannie’s boards will submit their changes to the CEOs’ pay packages for FHFA’s review. Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.) said Tuesday that he plans to file legislation by Friday to block pay hikes for Fannie and Freddie’s executive officers. “We can’t simply put the blinders on and say [Fannie and Freddie] are just like other companies,” said Royce. Watt voted against a similar bill when he was in the House in 2011. Other lawmakers also expressed concern, saying the move harkens back to the “failed model” leading up to the financial crisis. “While Director Watt’s decision to reassess the existing compensation cap may seem minor, it is emblematic of a much larger problem,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who tied the pay issue to the larger debate about overhauling housing finance. “FHFA appears ready and willing to unilaterally drive [Fannie and Freddie] back to the failed model of private gains and public losses. If Congress doesn’t act to reform our housing finance system, it will be blessing FHFA’s push to recreate the failed pre-conservatorship model.” The Obama administration said Tuesday that the pay packages for Fannie and Freddie CEOs should not be changed, but the ultimate decision lies with Watt, an independent regulator. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said both firms receive substantial taxpayer assistance and so far have not demonstrated the inability to attract talent. The Treasury Department is recommending that FHFA keep pay scales as is for the top executives, a Treasury spokesman said. “Thus far we’ve seen individuals with significant financial experience step forward and want to serve their country in this way,” Earnest said in a briefing with reporters. FHFA’s move to revamp the pay is basically an effort to keep things running smoothly at the two agencies, assuming Congress won’t reach an agreement any time soon on whether to abolish the firms or keep them around in a different form. “With FHFA encouragement, we are taking a longer-term view of managing the company that is partly due to the FHFA’s view of the legislative timing,” Freddie CEO Donald Layton said in an interview Tuesday. Layton and Fannie CEO Tim Mayopoulos each earn a base salary of 600,000, plus contributions to their retirement plans. Layton, who is not under contract, said he does not plan to leave the company as long as circumstances allow. Fannie and Freddie do not write new loans. They buy them from lenders and package them for sale into securities, which they guarantee for investors as a way to ensure more money is available for new mortgages. The Treasury took a majority stake in the firms when the government took them over in 2008, and eventually supplied them with 187.5 billion worth of bailouts to keep them afloat while they supported the housing market. Top members for Freddie and Fannie’s boards said in statements Tuesday that the move to revamp CEO pay is necessary to help them keep their top executives and allow operations to keep running smoothly while in limbo. “The Board of Directors is committed to ensuring that Fannie Mae continues to act as a good steward of taxpayer resources while taking all prudent measures to attract and retain the leadership and talent required to keep the company functioning well and contributing to a better housing finance system going forward,” Fannie’s non-executive chairman of the board, Egbert Perry, said in a statement. In the meantime, Congress’ efforts to resolve or dissolve Fannie and Freddie have yet to take off. This year, neither the House nor the Senate is expected to take up the effort any time soon. Last year, the Senate Banking Committee passed a bipartisan measure to replace Fannie and Freddie with a new agency, which the Obama administration supported. But progressive Democrats opposed it, saying the proposal would leave too much of the mortgage-finance system to big banks and wouldn’t do enough to provide affordable housing. A proposal from House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) would have dissolved the firms and left more of the market to private companies than the Senate plan, but that bill failed to reach the floor. House leaders were concerned it could split their caucus. Generally, the housing finance giants are doing better than they they once were. Both companies will have returned more than 230 billion back to taxpayers this summer, but that money doesn’t go toward paying down the Treasury’s stake in the firm, leaving them in danger of having to draw from the government if the housing market slips again. A recent stress test conducted by the FHFA estimates that the two firms could need up to 157 billion during a severe downturn. Treasury is authorized under existing law to provide another 258 billion than has already been drawn if needed. “I would say there are bigger issues than executive pay, and that is what to do with Freddie and Fannie,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in an interview Tuesday. Few analysts believe an agreement will be reached in this Congress, leaving Watt in the uncomfortable position of managing the companies through regulation. In some cases, he has taken a different path from his predecessor, former FHFA acting Director Ed DeMarco, who ran the companies with the expectation of winding them down. But DeMarco was vocal about keeping top executives’ pay competitive with other companies. DeMarco told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in November 2011 that the best way to deal with executive pay was for Congress to restructure the housing system and end the conservatorship of the companies. “Nothing like this has been done before — placing two of the largest private financial institutions in the world into government conservatorship and then overseeing their operations in that state for multiple years,” DeMarco told lawmakers at the time. “Determining appropriate compensation in this situation is vexing.” Zachary Warmbrodt contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","output":"The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is considering raising the salary for the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, despite objections from the U.S. Treasury Department, the Obama administration, and some lawmakers.

Like adult dogs, puppies need daily walks, but they should not be walked for long periods. Every day, walk the puppy for about five minutes for every month of age.","output":"Step 1: Identify the puppy's age To determine the appropriate length of daily walks, first establish the puppy's age. For instance, if a puppy is three months old, they would require a 15-minute walk (3 months x 5 minutes = 15 minutes). Step 2: Plan the walks Plan the walks around the daily schedule to ensure consistency. Ideally, walking the puppy around the same time every day will create a routine, which is beneficial to both the puppy and the owner. Consistent walks can help prevent anxiety and keep the puppy well-behaved. Step 3: Choose a safe and appropriate environment for walks Select a safe place for the walks where the puppy can explore and socialize without danger. This environment should be free of hazards and ideally provide opportunities for the puppy to interact with other dogs or new experiences. Step 4: Use a suitable leash and harness When walking a puppy, use the appropriate leash and harness to ensure their safety. A harness helps distribute the force more evenly across the body, reducing the risk of injury. Additionally, it provides better control over the puppy's movements. Step 5: Provide positive reinforcement during walks Positive reinforcement is crucial to help the puppy learn good behavior during walks. Praise them for walking calmly and keep distractions at a minimum. Be patient as puppies can be easily distracted or excited while walking. Step 6: Monitor the puppy's energy and signs of fatigue Keep an eye on the puppy's energy levels and look for signs they may be getting tired. As they grow, their stamina will increase, but it's important not to over-exert them in the beginning. Adjust the duration and frequency of walks as needed to suit their changing energy levels. Step 7: Incorporate basic obedience training during walks Once the puppy has become accustomed to walking on a leash, it's a good idea to begin working on basic obedience training during walks. This can include simple commands like sit, stay, and come. By following these steps, the puppy will receive the appropriate amount of exercise for their age while also preventing boredom and any potential destructive behaviors. Consistent, well-planned walks help keep puppies both physically and mentally engaged, contributing to their overall well-being."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given the following passage \\"There are two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private.

In more detail, the first step is as follows: 1. Inhalation of air: The process begins with the act of breathing in or inhaling air. As you take a breath, air enters your body through the nasal and oral passages. The air then travels down the trachea, continues through the bronchi, and eventually reaches the small air sacs called alveoli in the lungs. The alveoli are surrounded by a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries, where gas exchange occurs. To recap, the complete process of gas exchange includes: 1. Inhalation of air 2. Oxygen transport to the bloodstream: Once in the lungs, oxygen in the inhaled air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli and capillaries into the bloodstream. 3. Oxygen distribution and exchange for carbon dioxide: Oxygen-rich blood is carried by the circulatory system to all the cells in the body. At the cellular level, oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular respiration. 4. Carbon dioxide transport to the lungs: The bloodstream carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs, where it is transported back to the alveoli. 5. Exhalation of waste gases: Finally, the waste gas carbon dioxide is exhaled from the lungs and out of the body through the process of exhalation.

(January 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Hazzard County is having a reunion festival, which includes a Toughman-style contest, and a rattlesnake chili cookoff, along with several other events. Uncle Jesse is the grand marshal of the reunion and at the same time, is facing a lawsuit filed by Mama Josephine Maxx for access across Duke property to the Hazzard swamp where she intends to build a theme park. However, Jesse refused access, not wanting to see the swamp destroyed. However, this has made the rest of the townsfolk angry with him, as the new theme park means new jobs, and revenue for Hazzard County. Driving from Washington, D.C., the Congressman representing Hazzard County in Washington, Cooter Davenport, arrives first and goes back to the Duke farm with Jesse, where Jesse is barbecuing ribs for everyone. Shortly thereafter, a car pulls up. Jesse recognizes it as Bo due to the sound of the motor. Bo has gotten a ride from a friend as he, having returned to the professional racing circuit and has come back for the reunion, has wrecked his car (again, according to Jesse). Bo introduces the girl who brought him home and after she leaves, Cooter says she was so good looking, it hurt and Bo joked with him, saying the girl wasn't bad either. Then Daisy arrives on a motorcycle. Daisy has been at graduate school getting a PhD in ecology after a bitter divorce.

A bromate is a chemical compound that contains this ion. Examples of bromates include sodium bromate,, and potassium bromate,. - An oxoacid is an acid that contains oxygen. Specifically, it is a compound that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other element, with at least one hydrogen atom bound to oxygen that can dissociate to produce the H cation and the anion of the acid. - Bromic acid, also known as hydrogen bromate, is an oxoacid with the molecular formula HBrO. It only exists in aqueous solution. It is a colorless solution that turns yellow at room temperature as it decomposes to bromine. Bromic acid and bromates are powerful oxidizing agents and are common ingredients in Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions. Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions are a classic example of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. - Calcium bromate , Ca ( BrO3 ) 2 , is a salt of bromic acid and lime . It may be prepared by the anodic oxidation of calcium bromide . It is used as a flour improver ( E number E924b ) in some countries . - Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with physical systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium but can adequately be described in terms of variables (non-equilibrium state variables) that represent an extrapolation of the variables used to specify the system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is concerned with transport processes and with the rates of chemical reactions. It relies on what may be thought of as more or less nearness to thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress, not an established edifice. This article will try to sketch some approaches to it and some concepts important for it. - Bromine is a chemical element with symbol Br and atomic number 35. It is the third-lightest halogen, and is a fuming red-brown liquid at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured gas. Its properties are thus intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. Isolated independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Löwig (in 1825) and Antoine Jérôme Balard (in 1826), its name was derived from the Ancient Greek \\"\\" \\"stench\\", referencing its sharp and disagreeable smell. - An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as Na(aq) + Cl(aq). The word \\"aqueous\\" means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry.

What is the speed of the train is? Options: (A) 32 (B) 28 (C) 299 (D) 277 (E) 21 Let's think first. Some random reasoning:","output":"We can find the speed of the train by first finding the total distance that the train travels while crossing the bridge and then using the time it takes to complete this distance. When a train of length 100 meters completely crosses a bridge of length 300 meters, it will actually travel a distance equal to the sum of its own length and the length of the bridge, which is 100 + 300 = 400 meters. The train takes 45 seconds to cross this distance. To find the speed, we'll use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time where the distance traveled is 400 meters and the time taken is 45 seconds: Speed = 400 meters / 45 seconds = 8.89 (repeating) meters per second. Now, to find the train's speed in kilometers per hour (km/h), we'll convert the speed from meters per second to km/h by multiplying by 3.6 (since there are 3.6 km/h in 1 m/s): Speed = 8.89 m/s * 3.6 km/h per m/s = 32 km/h (approximately) So, the speed of the train is approximately 32 km/h, which corresponds to option (A) in your list of possibilities."},{"instruction":"Find the right ending to this passage.

Ariella's account earns her simple interest at the rate of 10% per annum. If Daniella has 400, how much money will Arialla have after two years?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"To find out how much money Ariella will have after two years, we first need to determine the initial amount she has in her son's savings account. Ariella has 200 more in her son's savings account than Daniella: Ariella's initial amount = Daniella's initial amount + 200 Ariella's initial amount = 400 + 200 Ariella's initial amount = 600 Now, we need to calculate the interest Ariella will earn after two years. Since her account earns a simple interest of 10% per annum, the interest calculation will be as follows: Simple interest = Principal × Rate × Time Where Principal is the initial amount, Rate is the interest rate, and Time is the number of years. In this case: Principal = 600 Rate = 10% (0.10 in decimal form) Time = 2 years Calculating the interest: Simple interest = 600 × 0.10 × 2 Simple interest = 120 Now, we know that Ariella will earn 120 in interest after two years. To find the total amount in her son's savings account after two years, we will add the interest to the initial amount: Total amount = Initial amount + Interest Total amount = 600 + 120 Total amount = 720 So, Ariella will have 720 in her son's savings account after two years."},{"instruction":"Here are two sentences: Nursing schools turned away more than 5,000 qualified applicants in the past year because of shortages of faculty and classroom space .

Sylvia Jane Hutton (nee Kirby, born December 9, 1956), known simply by her first name Sylvia during the 1980s, is an American country music and country pop singer and songwriter. Some original source books have her birth name as Sylvia Kirby Allen; however, Allen was her first husband's last name. She consequently used only her first name. There was also a point in time that she used Sylvia Rutledge. The release of her fourth album, Surprise, spurred her second foray into the Adult Contemporary charts, but neither its sound, nor her newly shorn locks courtesy Francesco Scavullo, were well received in country music. Surprise was the last of Sylvia's first four albums to be produced by Tom Collins, who also produced Mandrell, Charley Pride, and Ronnie Milsap. They have been described by critics as too slick for country music. Her following album, One Step Closer, produced by The Judds' producer Brent Maher, had a more guitar-driven feel to it as opposed to her previously more orchestrated affairs. It was followed up by Sylvia's last top 40 country hit, \\"Nothin' Ventured, Nothin' Gained\\", from the unreleased album Knockin Around. The shelving of this album marked the end of Sylvia's tenure with RCA Records. The label did release a Greatest Hits compilation and a single from it titled \\"Straight from my Heart\\" (written with Jimmy Fortune of The Statler Brothers). The record received little promotion from RCA and the single charted in the low 60s. In the late 1980s, RCA began streamlining its roster of country-pop artists and the casualties included Sylvia, Dolly Parton, Louise Mandrell, Deborah Allen, Juice Newton, John Denver and Kenny Rogers. Over an eight-year period, Sylvia crisscrossed America many times with her popular concert performances (over 200 per year), and she was a frequent guest on network television talk shows and specials -- from The Today Show and Good Morning, America to Dick Clark's American Bandstand and the Country Music Awards. Her decision to stop touring and recording at the end of the 1980s was not fueled by the grueling schedule, as some might guess, but by her desire to bring more of herself to the music, she turned her energies to songwriting.
