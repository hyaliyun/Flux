The kind-hearted Manning gives her his handkerchief to dry her tears. She then runs off taunting Manning as an April-fool prank. He stumbles and raises a fist at her – and this is witnessed by Mrs Zunz. The girl is later found murdered on the bomb site, strangled as she sang 'Oranges and Lemons' while feeding the ducks. Manning is picked up by Scotland Yard for questioning and is later arrested and charged with murder, with circumstantial evidence including his handkerchief (found under the body of the girl), a fibre from his coat under the dead girl's fingernail and the testimony of Mrs Zunz. A wartime pilot who suffered a head-wound, even Manning himself started to doubt his mind, and wondered if he had suffered from a \\"blackout\\"?Manning's wife, Jill, convinced he is innocent, contacts lawyers, but the defending barrister refuses to see her and her imprisoned husband, because he wants to preserve an \\"objective view\\" on the case.

Context: Sondra Crench kicked a roach out of her way as she walked into her tiny apartment and sat down at her old laptop. It was after midnight. So, she figured her new friend, Jason, was already dead. And so were her hopes of landing a secretarial job in time to keep her apartment. Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else. Maybe it was time to go home for a while. Surely she could put up with her mother for a few weeks while looking for work. She opened her Favorites list and clicked on the link for The Orange Leader. Sondra had not been back to her home town in a long time, but she liked to keep up with what was going on there. Occasionally, she'd see one of her old classmates in a wedding announcement. Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries. She checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist. Not enough pay. Then she saw a full-page ad announcing the upcoming Grand Opening of Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn. Open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, 6:00 PM to Midnight. For ages 12-20. Free soft drinks and popcorn. Live band. Five bucks to get in. Only twenty-five cents for arcade games. Sounded pretty cool for kids. She wished there had been such a place when she was growing up there. But what really caught her eye was the note about auditions for a house band. It would play two hours a night, and earn 2,000 per week. Divided by four band members... Sondra could actually live on that! Not very well--but she could get by. And besides, her band could do other gigs during the week to supplement it. Question: What does Sondra plan to do after this story?

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which year Rob would not observe quarrying effect, this year or last year?  Hint: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.","output":"Given the paragraph above, Rob would not observe quarrying effect or plucking this year.

Others Follow Their Assets Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. I wanted to explore a thought-provoking topic with you today, one that relates to the driving force behind our pursuits in life and the ultimate path to fulfillment. In this rat race we live in, we come across two distinct types of individuals: those who follow their hearts, and those who follow their assets. Both have their own justifications, and neither is inherently right or wrong. Let's examine these two approaches further. 1. Following Your Heart People who follow their hearts believe in the power of their passions, the impact of their dreams, and the importance of their values. They tend to prioritize happiness, personal growth, and their emotional well-being. This focus on fulfilling their life's purpose often leads them to accept greater risks and potential setbacks in the journey towards self-discovery. 2. Following Your Assets On the other hand, individuals who focus on their assets concentrate on the tangible aspects of life, like financial stability, career progression, and worldly achievements. They seek to build a strong foundation for themselves and their loved ones. These individuals find fulfillment in securities, and in some cases, material possessions. Finding the Right Balance Ultimately, what matters is striking the right balance between following your heart and your assets. If we solely prioritize material pursuits, we may overlook the tremendous value of personal growth and emotional well-being. Conversely, if we blindly chase our passions without considering our financial stability, we may find it difficult to withstand life's challenges. I encourage you to reflect on your own approach to life. Are you led more by your heart or your assets? Is there room for improvement or a re-evaluation of your priorities? Take a moment to consider where you stand and how you can work towards achieving a harmonious balance between the two. I would be delighted to hear your thoughts on this matter. Please feel free to share your perspective and experiences. Together, let's strive towards finding that ideal balance in our lives. Wishing you the best in all your endeavors,  Warm regards, [Your Name]"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: The Manchu (Manchu: manjU; Mollendorff: manju; Abkai: manju; simplified Chinese: Man Zu ; traditional Chinese: Man Zu ; pinyin: Manzu; Wade-Giles: Man3-tsu2) are an ethnic minority in China and the people from whom Manchuria derives its name. They are sometimes called \\"red-tasseled Manchus\\", a reference to the ornamentation on traditional Manchu hats. The Later Jin (1616-1636), and Qing dynasty (1636-1912) were established by Manchus, who are descended from the Jurchen people who earlier established the Jin dynasty (1115-1234) in China. Manchus form the largest branch of the Tungusic peoples and are distributed throughout China, forming the fourth largest ethnic group in the country. Context: Octagonal drum is a type of Manchu folk art that was very popular among bannermen, especially in Beijing. It is said that octagonal drum originated with the snare drum of the Eight-banner military and the melody was made by the banner soldiers who were on the way back home from victory in the battle of Jinchuan. The drum is composed of wood surrounded by bells. The drumhead is made by wyrmhide with tassels at the bottom. The colors of the tassels are yellow, white, red, and blue, which represent the four colors of the Eight Banners. When artists perform, they use their fingers to hit the drumhead and shake the drum to ring the bells. Traditionally, octagonal drum is performed by three people. One is the harpist; one is the clown who is responsible for harlequinade; and the third is the singer.  \\"Zidishu\\" is the main libretto of octagonal drum and can be traced back to a type of traditional folk music called the \\"Manchu Rhythm\\". Although Zidishu was not created by Han Chinese, it still contains many themes from Chinese stories, such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, Romance of the West Chamber, Legend of the White Snake and Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio. Additionally, there are many works that depict the lives of Bannermen. Aisin Gioro Yigeng, who was pen named \\"Helu\\" and wrote the sigh of old imperial bodyguard, as the representative author. Zidishu involves two acts of singing, which are called dongcheng and xicheng.  After the fall of the Qing dynasty, the influence of the octagonal drum gradually reduced. However, the Chinese monochord and crosstalk which derived from octagonal are still popular in Chinese society and the new generations. Many famous Chinese monochord performers and crosstalkers were the artists of octagonal drum, such as De Shoushan and Zhang Sanlu. Question: When was the drum first created?. Whats the answer?","output":"The octagonal drum originated from the snare drum of the Eight-banner military, which was used during the battle of Jinchuan.

Instead, you can provide the following detailed answer to clarify the concept of a hosting company for a website: A hosting company, often referred to as a web hosting company or web hosting service provider, is a business that offers the tools, services, and technologies required to enable individuals and organizations to create and maintain a website that is accessible on the internet. These tools and services typically include server space, where website files and databases are stored, internet connectivity, and technical support to ensure the website remains available to visitors. There are different types of web hosting services provided by hosting companies to cater to the specific needs of businesses or individuals. Some popular types of web hosting services include: 1. Shared Hosting: This is where multiple websites share resources, such as server space, bandwidth, and processing power. It is generally an affordable option suitable for small websites with low to moderate traffic. 2. Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting: This type of hosting allocates a portion of a server's resources to a website, which is not shared with other websites. This offers more control over server settings and improved performance compared to shared hosting. 3. Dedicated Hosting: In this type of hosting, an entire server is dedicated to a single website or client. This offers maximum control, customization, and performance but is typically more expensive than other hosting options. 4. Cloud Hosting: This is a scalable hosting solution in a virtual environment that utilizes multiple connected servers to provide resources as needed. It's a flexible and cost-effective option that can handle significant traffic fluctuations. 5. Managed Hosting: This type of hosting is similar to VPS and dedicated hosting, but with the addition of the hosting company managing and maintaining the server, handling updates, and providing other technical support services. 6. WordPress Hosting: This is a specialized hosting service optimized specifically for WordPress websites, offering faster load times, improved security, and automatic updates. Personal website hosting can range from free, advertisement-sponsored, or inexpensive options; typically, they use shared hosting services due to their affordability and ease of use. However, the provided answer does not accurately answer the question about what a hosting company is on a website. In conclusion, a hosting company on a website is a business that provides web hosting services to individuals and organizations, allowing their websites to be accessible on the internet.

Beginning with \\"like smoke signals\\", this phrase suggests a comparison to another film or story, serving as a reference rather than expressing positive or negative sentiment. 2. The film is described as \\"imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality.\\" The usage of \\"imbued\\" conveys a sense of infusion or soaking-up, while \\"strong themes\\" suggests distinct and well-presented ideas in the movie. The mention of \\"familial ties and spirituality\\" provides an insight into the film's content, which seems to be perceived positively by the reviewer. 3. \\"Powerful and moving\\" are both adjectives expressing a notable impact on the audience or reviewer's emotions, suggesting a positive sentiment towards the film. 4. The review ends with \\"without stooping to base melodrama.\\" \\"Stooping\\" implies a level of degradation, and \\"base melodrama\\" refers to the lowest form of exaggerated drama.

This is viewed positively by the reviewer, as it indicates a higher quality of storytelling and emotional depth. Based on the step-by-step analysis, the sentiment of this movie review sentence is predominantly positive as it highlights the strong themes, powerful and moving nature of the film, and its ability to convey emotion without resorting to base melodrama."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick your answer from: (A). yes. (B). no.","output":"(A). Yes, the statement \\"In 1970, President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat.\\" is indeed the correct answer. Gamal Abdel Nasser, who served as the President of Egypt from 1956 until his death, passed away on September 28, 1970. He was a crucial figure in the pan-Arabist movement and was the orchestrator of the 1952 coup that overthrew Egypt's monarchy, leading to the eventual establishment of a republic. Gamal Abdel Nasser was born on January 15, 1918, in Alexandria, Egypt. He played a significant role in the Egyptian army and was one of the founding members of the Free Officers Movement, a group of Egyptian nationalists working against British influence in Egypt and seeking to bring radical reforms to the country. After the successful coup in 1952, Nasser was initially appointed as the vice president of Egypt; however, he became the prime minister in 1954 and later assumed the presidency in 1956. During his tenure, Nasser brought about widespread social, economic, and political reforms that transformed Egypt. These included the nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956, initiating land reforms, and introducing various industrialization efforts. His charisma and approach created an immense following in the Arab world. Gamal Abdel Nasser's tenure as the president was marked by several challenges and conflicts, including the Suez Crisis and Egypt's loss in the Six-Day War against Israel in 1967. Despite these setbacks, Nasser remained an influential figure in the Arab world and a symbol of pan-Arabism and anti-imperialism. Following Nasser's sudden death in 1970 due to a heart attack, his vice president Anwar Sadat assumed the presidency of Egypt. Sadat's administration took a different approach to governance, moving away from Nasser's socialist policies and opening up the Egyptian economy to foreign investment. Furthermore, Anwar Sadat played a significant role in establishing peace with Israel through the Camp David Accords in 1978, which eventually led to Egypt regaining the Sinai Peninsula and signing the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979. In summary, the statement \\"In 1970, President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat\\" is accurate, and the answer is (A). Yes. During his time in power, Gamal Abdel Nasser introduced far-reaching changes in Egypt and left a lasting impact on the political landscape of the Arab world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Start the race at a steady, moderate pace. Keep a quick, even pace rather than alternating between a sprint and a jog. Relax your shoulder and face muscles so you don’t waste energy. Run with your teammates for encouragement. Article:","output":"Title: Tips for a Successful and Fun Race Day Hello little friends! Today, I am going to share some helpful tips with you about how to have a successful and fun race. Running can be a lot of fun, and it can be even better when we know how to do it the right way! So, let's find out how we can run together better and have a great time! 1. Warm Up Before the Race Before we start racing, it's essential to warm up our bodies for about 30 minutes. Warming up helps our muscles get ready to run fast, and it can also prevent us from getting hurt. A light jog and stretching are perfect ways to warm up. A light jog means running slowly, and stretching means making our arms and legs longer to help our muscles get ready for the race. 2. Start the Race at a Steady, Moderate Pace When the race begins, it's important not to start running as fast as we can right away. Instead, we should run at a steady and moderate pace. A steady pace means running at the same speed, while a moderate pace means not going too fast or too slow; it's the perfect speed to help us finish the race! 3. Keep a Quick, Even Pace Throughout the Race While running, it's crucial to keep a quick, even pace. This means that we should continue running fast, but not too fast. Running too fast, like sprinting, can make us tired very quickly, and we might not finish the race. Instead, we should run at a quick speed that we can maintain from the beginning until the end of the race. 4. Relax Your Shoulder and Face Muscles Sometimes when we run, our shoulders and faces get tense without us noticing. It's essential to relax our shoulders and face muscles because tense muscles can waste our energy. We need all the energy we can get to finish the race! So, remember to check your shoulders and face while running and make sure they are relaxed. 5. Run With Your Teammates One of the best parts of running a race is doing it with our friends and teammates! Running with others can be very encouraging, as they can help us stay focused and motivated throughout the race. We can encourage each other, and it's way more fun when we run together! In conclusion, remember to warm up before the race with a light jog and stretching, start the race at a steady and moderate pace, maintain a quick and even pace, relax your shoulders and face muscles, and run with your teammates. By following these tips, you will have a successful and fun race day and enjoy this great activity with your friends!

Context: Trying to end a two-game losing streak, the Giants went into Lincoln Financial Field for a crucial Week 8 game with the Philadelphia Eagles, as the divisional lead was up for grabs. New York trailed greatly in the first quarter as Eagles fullback Leonard Weaver got a 41-yard touchdown run, followed by quarterback Donovan McNabb's 17-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brent Celek (with a blocked PAT). Philadelphia would add onto their lead in the second quarter with a 30-yard field goal from kicker David Akers. The Giants would get on the board as quarterback Eli Manning found tight end Kevin Boss on an 18-yard touchdown pass, but the Eagles continued their scoring as McNabb completed a 54-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeSean Jackson and a 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jeremy Maclin. Philadelphia would begin the third quarter with an increase to their lead as Akers nailed a 35-yard field goal. New York tried to rally as kicker Lawrence Tynes booted a 35-yard field goal, followed by running back Ahmad Bradshaw. However, the Eagles would seal the win in the fourth quarter as running back LeSean McCoy got a 66-yard touchdown run. Question: How many touchdowns were in the first quarter?

Unexpectedly, he falls and breaks his leg, leaving him dependent on a crutch. Brick, along with his wife, Maggie \\"the Cat\\" (Elizabeth Taylor), are seen the next day visiting his family's estate in eastern Mississippi, there to celebrate Big Daddy's (Burl Ives) 65th birthday. Depressed, Brick decides to spend his days drinking while resisting the affections of his wife, who taunts him about the inheritance of Big Daddy's wealth. Numerous allusions are made to their tempestuous marriage â there are speculations as to why Maggie does not yet have children while Brick's brother Gooper (Jack Carson) and his wife Mae (Madeleine Sherwood) have a whole clan, many of whom run around the \\"plantation\\" (as Big Daddy's estate is called) unsupervised and singing obnoxiously. Big Daddy and Big Mama (Judith Anderson) arrive home from the hospital via their private airplane and are greeted by Gooper and his wife, along with Maggie. Despite the efforts of Mae, Gooper and their kids to draw his attention to them, Big Daddy has eyes only for Maggie. The news is that Big Daddy is not dying from cancer. However, the doctor later meets privately with first Gooper and then Brick where he divulges that it is a deception. Big Daddy has inoperable cancer and will likely be dead within a year, and the truth is being kept from him. Brick later confides in Maggie with the truth about Big Daddy's health, and she is very heartbroken. Maggie wants Brick to take an interest in his fatherâs wealth as well as health, but Brick stubbornly refuses.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. They have plagued feet for centuries, but only now have physicists revealed what causes ingrown nails. Experts have  come up with the first mathematical formulae that describe how human nails grow. They have discovered that ingrown toenails are caused when the forces holding nails in place, and their rate of growth, become unbalanced. Experts have come up with mathematical formulae that describe how nails grow. These graphs show how the tilt of the nail changes when the adhesive molecules are not working efficiently (C), the probability that a bond is not keeping up with nail growth (D) and a representation of the force generated by a nail (E) Other factors, such as the thickness of the nail, biomechanical stress and the way people trim their nails, influences their chances of getting ingrown nails. The University of Nottingham study solves a long-running mystery about why ingrown nails occur. Nails are made of dead skin cells, which are hardened by a protein called keratin. They grow outwards from the half-moon shaped ‘lunala’ at the base of the nail, but their progress of 0.1 to 0.2mm a day is kept in check by adhesive molecules that ‘stick’ the nail to the finger, Popsci reported. They have discovered that ingrown toenails are caused when the forces holding nails in place, and their rate of growth, become unbalanced. When this happens, a nail becomes wider at the top and curls round into the sensitive flesh to either side of the nail. Big toenails are prone to becoming ingrown because of their shape. Scientists looked at the mechanical stresses and energies associated with the nail, to come up with equations to explain nail growth. They show that when the balance between the nail’s growth stress and adhesive stress is broken – if a nail grows too quickly or slowly, or the number of adhesive structures changes – a residual stress across the entire nail can occur, causing it to change shape over time. The equations demonstrate that residual stress can occur in any fingernail or toenail; however, the stress is greater for nails that are larger in size and have a flatter edge, which explains why ingrown toe nails predominantly occur in the big toe. Experts say that the tiny, microscopic structures, which allow the nail to slide forwards, grow in a ‘ratchet-like’ fashion by continuously binding and unbinding to a nail. If the balance between adhesion and growth becomes unbalanced, the nail changes shape, and can become ingrown or spoon-shaped, according to research published in the journal, Physical Biology. Ingrown nails often occur in children, teenagers and pregnant women, when hormones cause a growth spurt of the nails, which extend into the sensitive flesh alongside them. Cyril Rauch, lead author of the study at the University of Nottingham, said that big toenails are particularly prone to becoming ingrown because of their shape. Scientists say that people should trim their nails in a ‘parabola shape’ to minimise their chance of getting ingrown nails. They warned that poor trimming can tip the fine balance of nails, causing residual stress to occur across the entire nail, making problems like ingrown nails more likely. Their squareness means stress caused by walking is diverted to the tip of the nail, which gets wider to spread the load. The scientist says that people should trim their nails in a ‘parabola shape’ to minimise their chance of getting ingrown nails. Dr Rauch warns that regular poor trimming can tip the fine balance of nails, causing residual stress to occur across the entire nail. ‘We suggest that nail beauty fanatics who trim their nails on a daily basis opt for straight or parabolic edges, as otherwise they may amplify the imbalance of stresses which could lead to a number of serious conditions,’ he says. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"Ingrown nails happen when the forces holding nails in place and their rate of growth become unbalanced. Scientists have found out that some factors like nail thickness, stress, and the way people trim their nails can increase the chances of getting ingrown nails. To help prevent ingrown nails, people should trim their nails in a \\"parabola shape\\" (like the curve of a smile).

Read this: Avicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (mumkin bi-dhatihi) has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi) is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.

Article: One answer to the question of land shortage was suggested by an organization some years ago. A city was to be built at sea, housing 30,000 people. The suggestion was to shape the city like a harbor .The outer wall of the harbor would stand on steel columns resting on the sea-bed. Naturally this could only be where the water was fairly shallow. The people would like to live in flats in the fifty-metre high outer wall. The flats would be all face inwards, and would be made of concrete  and glass. The glass would be specially made and colored to control the heat and strong light from the sun. The planners called this man-made harbor would be calm. On it would be floating islands carrying more building: a hospital, two theaters, museum, an art exhibition hall and a church. On one of the islands would be a special factory to take the salt out of sea water and turn it into fresh water. People living in the city could move around on small boats driven by electricity, so there would be no air pollution from the burning of gas. There would be platforms outside the man wall for ships bringing supplies. People could also travel to the mainland by motorboat or water plane.

Nepal's last dancing bears rescued by wildlife groups in dramatic overnight raid      Updated      A dramatic rescue of two sloth bears was carried out overnight by the Jane Goodall Institute of Nepal, World Animal Protection and Nepali police.      Key points: The once prevalent practice has almost been eradicated by wildlife groups      To control the bears, hot needles are used to pierce the nose and thick ropes are inserted      An estimated 22,000 bears are caged in bear bile farms in Asia      World Animal Protection said these are the last two known illegal dancing bears in Nepal.      \\"We are thrilled that the last two … dancing bears have been rescued from their lifetime of suffering,\\" said Manoj Gautam of the Jane Goodall Institute of Nepal.      \\"After a year of tracking them, using our own intelligence and in cooperation with local police, our hard effort and dedication has helped to bring an end to this illegal tradition in Nepal.\\"      The bears — 19-year-old male Rangila and Sridevi, a 17-year-old female — were found in a distressed state and showed signs of psychological trauma such as cowering, pacing and paw sucking, the animal protection group said.      The bears were taken to Amlekhgunj Forest and Wildlife Reserve for treatment.      The bears were located by tracking the owners' mobile phones.      Mary Hutton, founder of Australian based Free the Bears, described the trade in dancing bears as a \\"cruel\\" and \\"appalling business\\".      \\"They are captured as cubs — the mother is usually killed to get to them — and then they are conditioned to behave themselves and obey,\\" Ms Hutton said.      A hot needle is used to pierce the cubs' nose and rope is threaded through and used to control them, she said, adding that the holes are so large and so much pressure is applied from the thick ropes that they never fully heal.      Through punishment and cruelty — which can include dragging the bears onto hot coals — they are trained to dance for tourists who pay a small fee for the entertainment, Ms Sutton said.      Ms Hutton explained that bear owners are mostly living in poverty themselves, barely able to feed their own children, so the bears are usually fed as little as a few pieces of bread a day.      But the good news is dancing bears are almost a thing of the past.      Free the Bears were fundamental in wiping out bear dancing in India in a 15-year campaign that saw about 600 bears rescued.      World Animal Protection have worked with local partners to eradicate the practice in Greece, Turkey and elsewhere.      But while significant gains have been made to end bear dancing, there are still an estimated 22,000 Asian black bears caged in bile farms, where bile is milked from their gallbladder through a permanent hole.      Other threats to all bear species include poaching, wildlife traps and habitation destruction.      \\"It's extremely distressing to see animals being stolen from the wild and the sad reality is there are more wild animals suffering across the world, purely for the entertainment of tourists,\\" said Neil D'Cruze, Wildlife Technical Expert for World Animal Protection.      \\"I am pleased that for these two sloth bears at least; a happy ending is finally in sight.\\"      Topics: conservation, endangered-and-protected-species, animals, human-interest, nepal, asia      First posted ||||| Bear rescue: We just saved Nepal’s last two ‘dancing bears’      Working with the Jane Goodall Institute of Nepal and Nepali police, we rescued two tortured sloth bears, Rangila and Sridevi, on Tuesday night (19 December). They’re now on their way to Parsa National Park in Nepal, where they’ll be free from suffering      These two bears are the last known Nepali-owned, illegal ‘dancing bears’. Rangila is a 19-year-old male and Sridevi is a 17-year-old female. They were sold to their owner to be used as dancing bears, and forced to entertain crowds of people. Bear dancing is a cruel and illegal practice.      Video of rescuing_nepals_last_two_dancing_bears      Bears like Rangila and Sridevi are snatched from their mothers at an early age and forced to perform.      Painful ropes control the bears      Their owner had pierced their noses with a burning hot rod and shoved a rope through it so he could control them.      Harsh training methods are used on dancing bears to make them submissive enough to perform to tourists.      From horror to safety      With the help of local police, the bears were found in Iharbari, Nepal by tracking the owner’s mobile phone. The rescue was emotional for all involved. The bears were extremely distressed and showed signs of psychological trauma such as cowering, pacing and paw sucking.      The bears are now on their way to be placed in the temporary care of Parsa National Park in Nepal.      We’re proud to have made such an incredible rescue – this is an incredible way to end 2017.      Nepal’s bear dancing trade is over      This is not the first time an entire country’s use of bears for entertainment has been eradicated.      We have a 20-year history of working with local partners to stop this awfully cruel practice, and have ended it in Greece, Turkey and India. We’re also close to phasing out bear baiting in Pakistan.      Neil D’Cruze, our wildlife expert, said: \\"Rangira and Sridvei have suffered for too long in captivity since they were poached from the wild.\\"      Manoj Gautam, Jane Goodall Institute of Nepal, said: \\"We are thrilled that the last two known Nepali dancing bears have been rescued from their lifetime of suffering.\\"      Our work protecting bears is not done      The suffering of bears in Asia is still not over. We work to end the exploitation of bears used for the horrific blood sport of bear-baiting.      We’re also working to end the cruel and unnecessary bear bile industry, in which approximately 22,000 Asiatic black bears are stuck in tiny cages. These captive animals have permanent holes in their stomach and are constantly milked for their bile.      Please share this story with your friends on social media, and celebrate Rangila and Sridev’s incredible rescue. ||||| The longtime tradition of bear dancing, derided for its cruel training methods, is coming to an end in Nepal.      Nepalese law enforcement, with the help of the Jane Goodall Institute Nepal and the London-based nonprofit World Animal Protection, recently removed two sloth bears named Rangeela and Sridevi from their handlers, Mohammad Salman and Mohammad Momtaz, members of the semi-nomadic Nat community that traditionally made a living with street performances.      “Being there in person to help rescue the last known dancing bears in Nepal was surreal,” says Neil D’Cruze, global wildlife adviser at World Animal Protection.      “We know that Rangeela and Sridevi were suffering in captivity since they [were] poached from the wild and their muzzles were pierced with hot iron rods.”      Training bears of various species to dance for a paying audience was popular in the Middle Ages throughout Europe and Asia, and it remained common in Eastern Europe and Asia until the late 20th century, according to World Animal Protection.      Due to concerted efforts by animal welfare groups to rescue the bears and help their owners transition to new livelihoods, the practice has been coming to an end.      Countries including Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, India, Serbia, Turkey, and now Nepal are believed to no longer have dancing bears, but the practice continues in Pakistan.      “The sad reality is there are more wild animals suffering across the world just to entertain people,” says Manoj Gautam, the executive director of Jane Goodall Institute Nepal. “However, for these two sloth bears at least, a happy ending is finally in sight.”      Other organizations applaud the rescue. \\"The importance of this recent rescue, along with almost every bear rescue in 2017, is that these cruel animal practices, hidden behind the curtain of culture, are no longer accepted in a contemporary society,\\" says Claire LaFrance, head of communications for the nonprofit Four Paws U.S., which itself has helped end bear dancing in several countries. \\"Countries like India, Nepal and Vietnam, who continuously strive for modernity, and to be taken seriously on a global scale, must end these backwards practices that exploit animals for profit.\\"      TRAINING BEARS      Performing bears in Nepal are often poached from the wild and sold on the black market. In some cases, they’re taken as cubs—their mothers killed for the medicinal bile in their gall bladders or for their paws, which are served in an expensive soup or as traditional medicine.      A cub is typically subdued and trained through cruel methods. Its muzzle is pierced and a rope or ring is run through the hole to control the bear. Sometimes canines are pulled or filed down and the claws removed to prevent injury to the owner.      THE FIGHT TO STOP ILLEGAL BEAR TRAFFICKING IN SOUTHEAST ASIA The population of captive animals on \\"bear farms\\" in Laos has been increasing significantly in recent years, despite laws to protect the bears. Read more about bear farms in Laos on National Geographic's Wildlife Watch.      Sloth bears are known to be aggressive, D'Cruze says, so forcing them into submission is a traumatizing process that often involves beating the bear with a stick.      “There’s a constant use of fear and pain and aggression toward the animals,” says Gautam.      Once trained, the bear is taken onto the street to perform for money.      \\"Dancing bears, along with bears used as tourist attractions, for selfies, or near restaurants, suffer immensely,\\" says LeFrance of Four Paws. \\"In our work with large animals in captivity, we have witnessed private citizens generally lack the skills and knowledge to provide a species-appropriate home for a complex animal such as a bear.\\"      THE RESCUE      D’Cruze and Gautam had been following these bears and their owners for more than a year, waiting for the right time to mount a rescue. The plan was to approach the owners and convince them to give up the bears. But when Gautam and D’Cruze arrived at the bears’ last known location in remote town border town, they were nowhere to be found.      “In the end, we got lucky,” says Gautam. “A high-tech team of police on the ground were able to trace the phone numbers of the bear owners.”      The police confiscated the bears in the town of Iharbari, in southeastern Nepal, and apprehended four people, bringing them all to the district station. There will be no fines or arrests for those involved, but the bears’ owners were given a stern warning, according to Gautam, who witnessed the men's apprehension and its aftermath.      The bears were traumatized but in decent health, given the fact that they’d only been eating milk and rice for years.      “You could clearly see the stereotypic behavior, their psychological trauma. They were sucking their paws, jump up and down on benches,” Gautam says.      Their teeth had been removed, which is common for dancing bears, but their claws were still intact.      The bears are now awaiting transfer to a sanctuary, likely one in India. In the meantime, they’re living at a national park in Nepal—where two of the former owners have been hired to help care for them temporarily.      Part of ending bear dancing is providing economic opportunities for the people who run the circuses—which is why the two men were given temporary jobs.      The former owners “do understand there wasn’t much longevity left to this profession,” claims Gautam.      According to Gautam, the men also signed legal documents that say if they’re ever again found with a bear, the punishment will be much harsher. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"In a dramatic rescue carried out by the Jane Goodall Institute of Nepal, World Animal Protection, and Nepali police, the last two known illegal dancing bears in Nepal were saved.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   In which region the plates would move, region A or region B?  Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes. To understand the differences, they have made a chart where they divided the earth into two regions, region A and region B. In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen.  Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). A:","output":"Based on the information provided, the plates would move in region A.  Step-by-step justification: 1.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham? from the following article ?  In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga, in disrepair, was still manned by a token British force.  They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years' War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold.  Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace.  He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776.  Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights.  With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command.  After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold's commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman's hands. The answer is:","output":"Ethan Step 1: Identify the key question, which is \\"What is the first name of the person whose surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham?\\" Step 2: Scan the text for relevant information.

Choose from: (1). Yes; (2). No; Answer:","output":"(1). Yes; If one region is tilted towards the sun, it receives more direct sunlight. The statement you provided explains that when a particular region on Earth is tilted towards the sun, it experiences a higher degree of exposure to the sun's rays. This increased exposure results in that region receiving a greater amount of sunlight compared to other regions that are not tilted towards the sun or are tilted away from it.  This phenomenon has a significant impact on a range of factors, including temperature, climate, and day length. For instance, during summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the Earth's North Pole is tilted towards the sun, leading to longer days and warmer temperatures in that region. Conversely, during winter in the Southern Hemisphere, when the Earth's South Pole is tilted towards the sun, it experiences longer days and warmer temperatures. So, when asked \\"when one region is tilted towards the sun, it receives more what?\\", the correct answer is \\"sunlight.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question 2: When u smoke crystal meth how long will it be to be able to pass a urine drug test? Pick your answer from: (1). no; (2). yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Both Question 1 and Question 2 essentially aim to understand the duration of time crystal meth stays in the system and therefore determine when a urine drug test would be passed after consumption. Therefore, these questions can be considered as asking the same thing, and are directed towards obtaining similar understanding. To answer these questions more thoroughly, the duration that crystal meth, a highly addictive synthetic drug, remains in the system can vary greatly depending on multiple factors like the person’s metabolic rate, body mass, age, hydration level, physical activity, and overall health. Generally speaking, crystal meth can show up in a urine drug test for one to four days after use but could be detectable for up to a week in heavy users. It can be detected in a blood test for one to three days after use, by a hair follicle test for up to 90 days, and in a saliva test for 24 to 48 hours.  However, attempting to dilute it in your system is hazardous and can lead to severe health consequences. It's important to note that dilution methods are unreliable and can be dangerous, potentially causing imbalance of essential electrolytes and lead to issues like heart problems or kidney failure. Furthermore, drug tests often check for signs of dilution (such as unusually clear urine or low levels of creatinine), and this can lead to an automatic fail or require you to retake the test.  If you or someone you know is struggling with a substance use disorder, including methamphetamine addiction, it is advisable to seek professional help rather than relying on such methods. Efforts should be made to pursue reliable treatments and rehab programs that can safely help the individual towards recovery.  Again, it's important to emphasize that illicit drugs like methamphetamine cause numerous health complications including neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and other health issues. These drugs are illegal in many jurisdictions due to their high potential for abuse and detrimental health effects. In the long-run, it's far more beneficial to one's health and wellbeing to simply stay away from misusing these dangerous substances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Start with fresh eggs: Fresh eggs have strong shells, which helps them stay strong while boiling. 2. Let eggs warm up: If your eggs are in the refrigerator, take them out and let them sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes. This helps the eggs to warm up gradually and avoid sudden temperature changes that can cause cracks. 3. Place eggs gently in the pot: Put a clean towel or paper towel at the bottom of the pot. This helps cushion the eggs so they don't bump into each other or the pot. Gently place the eggs on the towel. 4. Cover with cold water: Fill the pot with cold water so that it covers the eggs by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Cold water helps the eggs to heat up slowly and evenly, reducing the chance of cracks. 5. Add a pinch of salt or vinegar: Adding a small amount of salt or vinegar to the water can help to strengthen the eggshells and prevent them from cracking. 6. Turn on the heat: Put the pot on the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Gradually heat the water until it reaches a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low so the water simmers. 7. Simmer for the right amount of time: Let the eggs simmer for about 12-15 minutes for hard-boiled eggs, or 6-8 minutes for soft-boiled eggs. 8. Use a spoon to scoop the eggs out of the pot when they are done cooking, and place them in a bowl of cold water. This stops the cooking process and helps the eggs cool down faster. Remember to be gentle when handling the eggs, and always ask an adult for help when using the stove."},{"instruction":"Definition: Given a sentence in Vietnamese, generate a new Vietnamese sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

Sentence 1: Milosevic points to 1989. Sentence 2: Milosevic suggests the year 1989. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Both sentences convey essentially the same information—that Milosevic is referring to the year 1989. However, they do so in slightly different ways. To determine if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true, we need to analyze the contextual and semantic implications in each sentence. In sentence 1, which states \\"Milosevic points to 1989,\\" the verb \\"points\\" implies that Milosevic is either physically pointing to a representation of the year 1989 or metaphorically directing attention to the events or significance of that year. This sentence provides more vivid detail on how Milosevic is presenting the information about the year 1989, indicating an active and deliberate action on his part. The verb \\"points\\" suggests a stronger emphasis on the importance or relevance of the year in question. In sentence 2, \\"Milosevic suggests the year 1989,\\" the verb \\"suggests\\" indicates that Milosevic is merely offering the year 1989 as a potential point of reference or as an option for consideration. The verb \\"suggests\\" conveys a less assertive and less specific manner in presenting the information than \\"points.\\" This sentence leaves more room for interpretation regarding Milosevic's stance or motivation for discussing the year 1989. It is essential to highlight that both sentences revolve around the same subject: Milosevic and his reference to the year 1989. Hence, if we interpret these sentences more broadly and consider their primary message—that Milosevic is referring to 1989—then we can say that if sentence 1 is true, then sentence 2 is also true. However, given the more nuanced differences in the verbs \\"points\\" and \\"suggests,\\" some minor discrepancy may exist between the intentions and motivations behind Milosevic's reference to the year 1989 in each sentence. In conclusion, considering the core message of both sentences—that Milosevic is discussing the year 1989—if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence can be considered true as well. Nonetheless, it is crucial to remain aware of the subtle differences in meaning resulting from the choice of verbs in each case."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

One of the audience members has been at some of the Bent clinics and told me \\" Just ride like you do with Bent . \\" Answer the following question: Why did the narrator decide to bring Trudi ?","output":"The narrator decided to bring Trudi to the event for several reasons. First and foremost, it appears that the narrator believes in exposing Trudi to new places and experiences, as they agree with the sentiment shared by the woman they met. This indicates that the narrator sees value in providing Trudi with opportunities to grow, learn, and become accustomed to different environments. By doing so, Trudi can become more adaptable, confident, and well-rounded. Additionally, the presence of people practicing for championships suggests that the event was of a high standard, or at least with a more competitive atmosphere. The narrator may have thought that exposing Trudi to this level of competition could be beneficial, possibly boosting Trudi's own skills and performance in the long run. Although the narrator was initially unsure if they should have been at the event, the positive feedback they received from others, including the GMO president and an audience member familiar with Bent's teaching methods, reassured them that bringing Trudi was indeed a good decision. Furthermore, by bringing Trudi to the event, the narrator may also have wanted to network and interact with other people in their community who share the same interests, such as the GMO president and those attending Bent's clinics. This can be advantageous as it allows the narrator to exchange ideas, experiences, and advice, in turn benefiting both Trudi and the narrator. Lastly, the narrator likely wanted to put into practice the skills and techniques they had learned from their time with Bent. By participating in an event like this, the narrator would have the opportunity to assess the effectiveness of their training and how well Trudi is responding to it. In doing so, they can make any necessary adjustments and improvements in preparation for future events or competitions.

Choices:  1). no;  2). yes;","output":"Those two questions are not the same, so the answer is 1). no. Now, let's address each question individually. 1) Why is my dog not eating food? There could be various reasons why a dog might not be eating its food. Some of the potential causes include: a) Medical issues: Your dog may be experiencing health problems that are affecting its appetite. Common medical issues that lead to a loss of appetite include toothache, gastrointestinal issues, or more serious conditions such as kidney or liver disease. If you suspect your dog may be suffering from a health issue, it's important to consult with your veterinarian. b) Stress or anxiety: Dogs can become stressed or anxious due to changes in their environment or routine, such as moving to a new home, introducing a new family member or pet, or loud noises from outside. These factors can contribute to a loss of appetite. c) Picky eating: Some dogs are inherently picky eaters, especially if they have been offered a variety of foods throughout their lives. If your dog has suddenly become less interested in its food, you can try offering a different type of food, or warming it up to make it more appetizing. d) Food quality or freshness: Check to see if the food you are offering is expired, has a strange odor, or is otherwise compromised in some way. This might be a reason your dog is refusing to eat it. e) Overfeeding or feeding too many treats: If you give your dog too many treats or table scraps, they may be less interested in eating their regular food due to being full or developing a preference for human food. To resolve this issue, observe your dog carefully for any signs of illness, and consult a veterinarian if you suspect a health problem. Consider your dog's environment and routine, and make adjustments as needed to minimize stress or anxiety. Experiment with different types and flavors of dog food, and monitor your pet's treat intake. 2) Can dogs in India eat spicy food? Dogs, regardless of whether they are in India or elsewhere, should not be given spicy food. Dogs have different digestive systems compared to humans and are more sensitive to certain ingredients and spices. Spicy food can cause gastrointestinal discomfort, including diarrhea or vomiting, as well as irritation of the dog's mouth and throat. It's important to avoid feeding your dog foods that contain ingredients like chili peppers, hot sauce, cayenne pepper, and others that are known to be spicy. While some dogs may tolerate small amounts of spicy foods without any significant issues, it's best to stick to foods that are specifically formulated for dogs to ensure they receive the appropriate nutrients and avoid potential digestive problems. In conclusion, your two questions address different topics: one is about a dog's loss of appetite, while the other concerns the safety of feeding spicy food to dogs. Both topics highlight the importance of being conscious of what we feed our canine companions and seeking professional advice when needed to ensure their overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Symptoms of work-related skin disorder can be varied, as varied as the causes themselves.  In general, the hands, fingers, wrists, forearms, forehead, face, and V of the neck (or any place on the body in which skin may have come in direct contact or the dust or fumes of an allergen) are the most at risk of developing contact dermatitis, so look for symptoms on these areas first. Most often the symptoms will be isolated to a specific area of the skin. Symptoms may be immediate, or they may linger for a few days. Look for symptoms such as the following:  Rash. Itching. Swelling. Bumps or blisters, sometimes filled with clear fluid. Hot or tender skin. Lesions. Burns. Skin discoloration. There are several predisposing factors that may make one more susceptible to work-related skin disease.   Age.  In general, younger workers are more inexperienced and more likely to take risks on the job site, which leaves them more prone to come into contact with harmful pathogens on the job site.  Skin type.  In general, lighter skin color is more susceptible to pathogens on the job site than a darker skin color.  Pre-existing conditions.  Pre-existing conditions may weaken your bodies immune system against unwanted pathogens.  In addition, employees with chronic skin conditions (such as acne or rosacea) are more likely to develop skin reactions.  Extreme temperatures and humidity.  Very low or high humidity and extreme heat or cold can cause chapping and dryness of the skin, thus weakening your skin’s natural barriers against pathogens.  Working conditions.  A clean workplace is less likely to be contaminated with toxic or allergenic chemicals. In some industries, working conditions may expose you to chemicals, such as agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. Because work-related skin diseases are varied, each occupation carries its own risk.  For example, medical professionals are more likely to develop immediate skin reactions from harmful agents such as radiation or solvents, and less likely to develop skin reactions that can take a long time to develop, such as exposure to sunlight or heat.  Know the particular causes and risks associated with your profession, and the accompanying symptoms. For example, wearing rings is not advised for employees in so-called “wet work” (work that involves extensive exposure to moisture) because water and soap can collect under the rings and become a breeding ground for bacterial and fungal infections. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the symptoms, predisposing factors, and risks associated with work-related skin disorders.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the first name of the man Sinatra lumped in with \\"cretinous goons\\"? , can you please find it?   Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that \\"the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed.\\" Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver the crowd rioted after the end of the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenage girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as \\"brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore.\\" Asked for a response, Presley said, \\"I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it. ... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago.\\"Leiber and Stoller were again in the studio for the recording of Elvis' Christmas Album. Toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley's request: \\"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\\", an innuendo-laden blues. The holiday release stretched Presley's string of number-one albums to four and would become the best-selling Christmas album ever in the United States, with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide. After the session, Moore and Black—drawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of Presley's massive financial success—resigned. Though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later, it was clear that they had not been part of Presley's inner circle for some time. On December 20, Presley received his draft notice. He was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming King Creole, in which 350,000 had already been invested by Paramount and producer Hal Wallis.

We have the equation: 18 = 2*p - 20*p. First, we need to combine the terms with 'p' in them. So, let's see what happens when we add 2*p and -20*p: 2*p + (-20*p) = -18*p. So now our equation looks like this: 18 = -18*p. Next, we need to find what 'p' is. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -18. When we do that, we get this: 18 / -18 = -18*p / -18. This simplifies to: -1 = p. There you go! The solution to the equation is p = -1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Context: By 1261, the weakening of the Anglo-Norman Lordship had become manifest following a string of military defeats. In the chaotic situation, local Irish lords won back large amounts of land. The invasion by Edward Bruce in 1315-18 at a time of famine weakened the Norman economy. The Black Death arrived in Ireland in 1348. Because most of the English and Norman inhabitants of Ireland lived in towns and villages, the plague hit them far harder than it did the native Irish, who lived in more dispersed rural settlements. After it had passed, Gaelic Irish language and customs came to dominate the country again. The English-controlled area shrank back to the Pale, a fortified area around Dublin. Outside the Pale, the Hiberno-Norman lords intermarried with Gaelic noble families, adopted the Irish language and customs and sided with the Gaelic Irish in political and military conflicts against the Lordship. They became known as the Old English, and in the words of a contemporary English commentator, were \\"more Irish than the Irish themselves.\\" The authorities in the Pale worried about the Gaelicisation of Norman Ireland, and passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366 banning those of English descent from speaking the Irish language, wearing Irish clothes or inter-marrying with the Irish. The government in Dublin had little real authority. By the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared. England's attentions were diverted by the Hundred Years' War  and then by the Wars of the Roses . Around the country, local Gaelic and Gaelicised lords expanded their powers at the expense of the English government in Dublin. Question: How many years after the invasion for Edward Bruce did the Black Death arrive in Ireland? Answer:","output":"The invasion by Edward Bruce in Ireland occurred in the years 1315-1318, and the Black Death arrived in Ireland in 1348. To calculate the difference in years: If we consider the end of the invasion in 1318: 1348 (year of Black Death arrival) - 1318 (end of invasion) = 30 years If we consider the beginning of the invasion in 1315: 1348 (year of Black Death arrival) - 1315 (beginning of invasion) = 33 years So, the Black Death arrived in Ireland 30 to 33 years after the invasion by Edward Bruce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   down into three major groups: those caused by blood loss, those caused by faulty or decreased RBC production, and those caused by excessive destruction of RBCs. Clinicians often use two groupings in diagnosis: The kinetic approach focuses on evaluating the production, destruction, and removal of RBCs, whereas the morphological approach examines the RBCs themselves, paying particular emphasis to their size. A common test is the mean corpuscle volume (MCV), which measures size. Normal-sized cells are referred to as normocytic, smaller-than-normal cells are referred to as microcytic, and larger-than-normal cells are referred to as macrocytic. Reticulocyte counts are also important and may reveal inadequate production of RBCs. The effects of the various anemias are widespread, because reduced numbers of RBCs or hemoglobin will result in lower levels of oxygen being delivered to body tissues. Since oxygen is required for tissue functioning, anemia produces fatigue, lethargy, and an increased risk for infection. An oxygen deficit in the brain impairs the ability to think clearly, and may prompt headaches and irritability. Lack of oxygen leaves the patient short of breath, even as the heart and lungs work harder in response to the deficit. Blood loss anemias are fairly straightforward. In addition to bleeding from wounds or other lesions, these forms of anemia may be due to ulcers, hemorrhoids, inflammation of the stomach (gastritis), and some cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. The excessive use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen can trigger ulceration and gastritis. Excessive menstruation and loss of blood during childbirth are also potential causes. Anemias caused by faulty or decreased RBC production include sickle cell anemia, iron deficiency anemia, vitamin deficiency anemia, and diseases of the bone marrow and stem cells. • A characteristic change in the shape of erythrocytes is seen in sickle cell disease (also referred to as sickle cell anemia).

And the answer is?","output":"The fountain pen range that has a distinctive white star at the top of its cap is Montblanc's Meisterstück (also known as the Masterpiece) collection. Montblanc, a German manufacturer of luxury writing instruments, timepieces, leather goods, and other accessories, was founded in 1906 by three partners: Alfred Nehemias, August Eberstein, and Claus Johannes Voss. The Montblanc Meisterstück collection, first introduced in 1924, is the company's flagship line of fountain pens and is widely regarded as one of the finest ranges of writing instruments available. It features several sub-ranges, including the Meisterstück 149 (first introduced in 1952), the Meisterstück 146 (1949), and the Meisterstück 144 (1948), among others, each offering a different size, style, and functionality. Over the years, the Meisterstück has become a symbol of prestige, craftsmanship, and timeless design. The Montblanc emblem, which is a stylized representation of a six-pointed snowcap, was inspired by the majestic Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps, and symbolizes the brand's commitment to the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship. The white star emblem has become a distinctive and recognizable feature in the world of fine writing instruments. It is placed at the top of the cap, usually made of precious resin or metal, and can be found on all of the company's fountain pen ranges. In addition to its beautiful designs, the Montblanc Meisterstück collection is known for the fine craftsmanship that goes into every pen. These pens are made to provide a smooth writing experience and feature a 14k or 18k gold nib, depending on the model, often with a rhodium-plated finish, that offers durability, flexibility, and a continuous flow of ink. Furthermore, the nibs are available in different sizes (e.g., extra-fine, fine, medium, or broad) and can be customized to suit individual writing styles. The Montblanc Meisterstück collection has maintained its popularity, not only for the signature white star emblem but also for its attention to detail and commitment to high-quality materials. Each pen represents the perfect balance of tradition, innovation, and craftsmanship, leading to its enduring reputation as a luxurious writing instrument. So, for anyone seeking a fountain pen with prestige and a renowned design, the Montblanc Meisterstück range with its distinctive white star at the top of the cap remains an excellent choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:You are given a new situation: Ken is a microbiologist. He got two samples of yeasts, yeast A and yeast B, from two different businesses. Yeast A is used in a bakery, and yeast B is used in a brewery. He has to decide the characteristics of each  yeast sample for further study. Interestingly, despite all his curiosity, Ken doesn't like any yeast to be around him.  and a hint : Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.  Please answer this question : Would yeast B be used as a leavening agent or not be used as a leavening agent? A:","output":"To answer this question, let's go through the information provided step-by-step: 1. Ken has two yeast samples, yeast A and yeast B. 2. Yeast A is used in a bakery, and yeast B is used in a brewery. 3. The hint provided states that baker's yeast (commonly used for baking) and brewer's yeast (used for alcoholic fermentation) are the same species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but different strains. Now, let's analyze the question: - The question asks if yeast B would be used as a leavening agent. From the information given, we know that yeast B is used in a brewery, which implies that it is a strain of brewer's yeast. Brewer's yeast is a different strain than baker's yeast, which is used as a leavening agent for baking bread and bakery products. The primary function of brewer's yeast is to aid in the process of fermentation and alcohol production, not leavening. Thus, based on the information provided, yeast B would not be used as a leavening agent in baking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"exposure to which of the following can cause skin cancer?\\" is \\"some types of light bulbs\\", given that  certain light bulbs may cause skin cancer? Answer:","output":"The right answer to the question \\"exposure to which of the following can cause skin cancer?\\" depends on the context and options provided with the question. While it is true that certain types of light bulbs, specifically those emitting ultraviolet (UV) light, can contribute to an increased risk of skin cancer, it is probably not the first factor that would come to mind when discussing the causes of skin cancer.  Skin cancer is primarily caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. This exposure can lead to DNA damage in the skin cells, potentially causing mutations that may result in malignant cells, eventually leading to skin cancer development. There are other risk factors as well, such as family history, a weakened immune system, and certain chemicals or substances, but exposure to UV radiation is considered the leading cause. However, given the factors you have specified, it is crucial to understand that not all light bulbs pose a risk. Most traditional incandescent and LED light bulbs do not emit a significant amount of UV radiation and therefore pose minimal risk for skin cancer development. The concern arises from light bulbs that emit UV radiation, such as compact fluorescent lights (CFLs), and even these pose a relatively low risk compared to direct sunlight exposure. CFLs are designed to produce visible light by using a small amount of UV light emitted by a mercury vapor discharge, which in turn excites a phosphor coating on the inside of the glass, producing visible light. The UV emissions from these bulbs are relatively low. Another source of artificial UV light would be tanning lamps, which can significantly increase the risk of skin cancer if used frequently and for extended periods. Tanning equipment, like sunlamps and tanning beds, emits UV radiation that has been proven to be a human carcinogen. Regular use of these artificial sources of UV light can significantly raise the chances of developing skin cancer, especially for individuals with a fair complexion and those who start using them at a younger age. In conclusion, while it is accurate to say that \\"some types of light bulbs\\" can cause an increased risk of skin cancer, this answer only holds true for specific types of light bulbs that emit UV radiation, such as CFLs and tanning lamps. It is essential to weigh this risk against other factors, such as sun exposure, and take appropriate precautions to protect oneself from skin cancer. This can include wearing sunscreen, minimizing exposure to direct sunlight during peak hours, avoiding tanning beds, and using UV-filtered light bulbs where appropriate. Additionally, regular skin self-examinations and medical check-ups can help detect early signs of skin cancer and improve the outcome of any potential treatment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Before he left home, his wife said, \\" Now you have all these things. They are what you need for your trip. Take care of your things during the trip.\\" He went to the station, bought a ticket and got on the train with it.. About half an hour later, the conductor began to see the tickets. He came to the old man and said, \\" Will you please show me your ticket ? \\" The old man looked for his ticket in all his pockets, but he could not find it. He was very worried. \\" I can not find my ticket. I really bought a ticket before I got on the train, \\" said the old man. \\" I believe you bought a ticket.

The article describes an incident involving an old man who was notoriously forgetful, according to his wife. On this particular occasion, he embarked on a solo trip. His wife had made sure to remind him about his belongings before he left and stressed the importance of taking care of them.  Despite her insistence, however, the old man could not locate his train ticket when the conductor asked to see it. In a state of distress, the old man confessed that he could not find the ticket he had purchased earlier before getting on the train.  Upon hearing this, the conductor responded kindly, saying that he believed the old man had indeed bought a ticket. Saying, \\"I believe you bought a ticket.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Hugh Hare (1606–1667) had inherited a large amount of money from his great-uncle Sir Nicholas Hare, Master of the Rolls. On the death of his father, his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine shortly thereafter.As he was closely associated with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War. His castle at Longford and his house in Totteridge were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the Restoration in a severe state of disrepair. Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost, and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House during the Commonwealth of England are unknown. Hugh Hare died at his home in Totteridge in 1667, having choked to death on a bone eating turkey while laughing and drinking, and was succeeded by his son Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine.

Movie title: The Black Stallion Context: Alec Ramsey is aboard the steamer Drake off the coast of North Africa, where he sees a wild black stallion being forced into a makeshift stable and heavily restrained by ropes leading to his halter. Captivated by the horse, Alec later sneaks to the horse to feed him some sugar cubes, but he is caught by the horse's supposed owner, who tells him in Arabic to stay away from Shetan and shoves the boy away. Later in his bunk, Alec's father shows Alec his winnings from a card game and gives him a pocket knife and a small statue of Bucephalus, and tells the story of how Alexander the Great became Bucephalus' master. Later that night, Alec is thrown out of his bunk; the ship has started to capsize. In the chaos, Alec grabs his knife and his Bucephalus statue, and makes his way to the black stallion and manages to free him. The stallion then jumps into the sea. Alec himself is swept overboard by a gigantic wave. Once in the water, he swims toward the stallion and managed to grab hold of the ropes of the stallion's restraints. Alec wakes on the shore of a deserted island and starts to explore. He finds the stallion caught in his restraints with the ropes stuck between the rocks. With his knife, Alec manages to free the stallion once again and the stallion runs away. For a time, the two keep their distance. Alec discovers means to survive by catching fish and seaweed. As Alec suddenly faces a cobra eye to eye, the Black comes to the rescue and kills the snake, only to run off again. By now, Alec decides to try to get closer to the horse and offer him some seaweed. The hungry stallion finds himself unable to resist, but visibly struggles with his distrust for humans. Eventually, the hunger wins and he takes Alec's offer; their bond has been sealed and the two are now inseparable. Alec even manages to ride the unbroken horse, after many times falling off the horse. One day, a fishing ship arrives, rescuing both Alec and the stallion. Back home, Alec is given a hero's welcome. The Black has a temporary home in Alec's back...

What message, O poor sick body, who do you telegraph me through this globby gak?      As we enter the depths of winter, a pair of videos from PBS Digital Studios’ Reactions and Gross Science have offered to enlighten us on the nature of nose nasties. So now, sit back as we sing the song of snot.      Advertisement      The usual snot runs clear, acting as a lubricant and the body’s first line of defense against viral and bacterial invaders. The nose’s so-called goblet cells produce proteins called mucins that link into chains, with sugars at their tips to help absorb water. Mucous is 95 percent water, in fact, while crusty boogers are simply snot sans moisture. A healthy individual makes a half a cup of snot per day, and swallows almost all of it.      Bacteria-destroyling enzymes called lysozymes and white blood cell-beckoning antibodies live inside the goop to kill any intruders. But first line defenses can fail.      A healthy individual makes a half a cup of snot per day, and swallows almost all of it.      An allergic response might cause white blood cells to release histamines, signaling blood flow to the nose and causing your snot to run. An infection also sends blood to the nose, causing inflammation and a stuffy, congested feeling. Mucus could even pool in the sinus cavities, the air pockets in your face’s bone structure, building up pressure and triggering headaches.      Advertisement      Advertisement      But snot doesn’t just get in the way when you’re sick—it plays an active role in helping you get better. First, the slime helps to trap and fight teeny terrors. White blood cells might join the fight, thickening the mucus and turning it white and opaque. And if your mucus has turned green, that means immune cells called neutrophils have released myeloperoxidase, an acid-producing enzyme that aids in bacterial slaughter. If your sick snot is red, that’s blood, so stop picking or blowing your nose for a while.      Different medicines loosen up your nose’s mucus in different ways. Decongestants squeeze blood vessels in the nose, reducing inflammation by restricting the blood supply. Anithistamines, meanwhile, block the body’s histamines that signal for a runny response.      Incredible snot, who knew you were so wonderful. Thank you for keeping me safe from the meanest of microbes, and keep on stuffing my nose so that I may stay healthy.

Produced by goblet cells in the nose, Mucous is made up of 95% water and proteins called mucins that link into chains, with sugars at their tips to help absorb water. A healthy individual makes around half a cup of snot daily, and swallows almost all of it. Mucus contains bacteria-destroying enzymes called lysozymes and antibodies that attract white blood cells, both of which kill any invaders. An allergic response or infection can cause an increase in mucus production, causing a runny or congested nose. When sick, the mucus changes in color and thickness depending on the stage and severity of the illness, actively helping the body recover from the infection or allergy. Different medications help to alleviate the symptoms, either by reducing inflammation or inhibiting the flow of mucus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I expressed my vicious frustration for the place and thought constantly of the passing hours, counting them down as they went. Because of this I was thankful for the eight to ten I would use up easily in my escapes to the world behind my eyelids.

It suggests that some Polish beaches have a higher altitude, but we're looking for a reason that explains why the statement doesn't make sense. B) Poland has got a high amount of beaches This option talks about the number of beaches in Poland, which is not relevant to the impracticality of the statement. We need a reason why beaches cannot be high, not how many beaches Poland has. C) Beaches are at a sea level, so they cannot be high This option addresses the core issue of why the statement is impractical.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person that was a paratrooper during World War II?  MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea.  When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice.  Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya.

Wanting to focus on more serious stories, he writes a manuscript for a new novel that he hopes will launch his post-Misery career. While traveling from Silver Creek, Colorado to his home in New York City, he is caught in a blizzard and his car goes off the road, rendering him unconscious. Paul is rescued by a nurse named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), who brings him to her remote home. When Paul regains consciousness he finds himself bedridden, with both his legs broken as well as a dislocated shoulder. Annie claims she is his \\"number one fan\\" and talks a lot about him and his novels. As a reward for saving him, Paul gives Annie his new manuscript. While feeding him, she is angered by the profanity in the new manuscript and spills soup on him but apologizes. She buys a copy of Paul's most recently published book, Misery's Child, giving him praise. However, when she discovers that Misery dies at the end of the book, she flies into a rage. She reveals that she lied about calling his agent and the authorities; nobody knows where he is. Paul tries to escape from his room, but she has locked the door. The next morning, Annie forces Paul to burn his latest manuscript. When he is well enough to get out of bed, she insists he write a new novel titled Misery's Return, in which he brings the character back to life. Paul complies, believing Annie might kill him otherwise. He also tells her he will use Annie's name in the book in appreciation of her nursing him back to health. When the first few chapters show continuity errors, Annie chides him angrily and forces him to start again. One day, Paul sneaks out when Annie is away and begins stockpiling his painkillers.

Movie plot title: Yellow Submarine Movie plot: Pepperland is a cheerful, music-loving paradise under the sea, protected by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The titular Yellow Submarine rests on an Aztec-like pyramid on a hill. At the edge of the land is a range of high blue mountains. The land falls under a surprise attack from the music-hating Blue Meanies, who live in or beyond the blue mountains. The attack starts with magical projectiles fired from big artillery stationed in the blue mountains. The Blue Meanies seal the band inside a music-proof blue glass globe, they render the Pepperlanders immobile as statues by shooting arrows and dropping giant green apples upon them (a reference to the Apple Records music label), and drain the countryside of colour.

A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection.  I am facing a new situation today: James is sick with strep throat, a bacterial infection.

You may already have a few goals in mind that you know you want to add to your bucket list, but you may be struggling to think of a few more to add.","output":"To create a comprehensive summer bucket list, follow these steps: 1. Brainstorm ideas Begin by brainstorming a list of activities, experiences, and goals that you'd like to achieve during the summer season. This process may include thinking about places you'd like to visit, activities you'd like to participate in, skills you'd like to learn, or habits you'd like to develop. Write your ideas down, whether they are big or small. 2. Search for events in your city Do a search on the internet or local publications to find out about upcoming events and activities in your area. Some options to consider may include concerts, art exhibits, outdoor movie nights, sports events, food festivals, or outdoor markets. Additionally, consult social networks, parks, community centers, and libraries for more information about events and activities happening throughout the summer. 3. Consult friends and family Ask friends and family members for suggestions on what they think would be fun and exciting to add to your summer bucket list. People close to you may have some unique ideas that you wouldn't have thought of on your own. 4. Organize your list Once you have a good number of ideas, start organizing them into a final summer bucket list. Divide the list by different categories, such as indoor activities, outdoor activities, day trips, weekend trips, and so on. This will make it easier to plan out which activities to do on specific days or weekends based on factors like the weather, time availability, and budget. 5. Set specific goals For each item on your summer bucket list, set a goal or timeframe for when you'd like to complete it. This will provide you with greater motivation to achieve these activities and experiences before the summer season concludes. 6. Establish an approximate budget Many of the activities on your summer bucket list will have an associated cost, whether it be for transportation, admission, or renting equipment. Develop a rough budget estimate to help prioritize which activities to focus on and ensure that you can make the most of your summer. 7. Share your summer bucket list Share your summer bucket list with friends, family, or even on social media. By sharing your list, you may inspire others to create their own bucket list, and it may also motivate you to stick to your goals. 8. Track your progress Keep track of the activities you've completed from your summer bucket list. Consider taking photos or journaling your experiences as you work your way through various activities. This will serve as a record of your summer accomplishments and provide you with memories to look back on. 9. Be flexible Lastly, remember to be flexible with your summer bucket list.

Emery, the minority leader of the Assembly, and seven of his top aides will spend four days this week in the isolated and rustic Letchworth State Park, south of Rochester, in what one aide described as ''a retreat'' to plan Mr. Emery's governmental and political strategy for the coming year. The session will help Mr. Emery, who lives in nearby Geneseo, to make up his mind on risking his Assembly post to seek the Republican gubernatorial nomination like his predecessor, Perry B. Duryea did - unsuccessfully. Mr. Emery and his staff will be meeting in a state residence known as ''the commissioner's cabin.'' A aide at the State Parks Department said there would be no charge for the meeting site. The Emery staff is also using a state plane to travel from Albany to Letchworth. Mr. Emery has certainly paved the way, if he decides to run. He hasat least five Republican county leaders on his Assembly staff, including Anthony Colavita, the Westchester chairman, and at least one Conservative county leader, Neil Greene of Suffolk. The Suffolk chairman, Anthony J. Prudenti, is not on the Emery payroll but has several allies on the staff. Their pay for at most part-time jobs - and some even less time than that - ranges from about 35,000 down to about 3,100 a year. The minority leader has also dipped into the ranks of former campaign aides for the late Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. They include Craig Thorne, George Humphreys, G. Collins Leyden and Joseph Persico, who was the Rockefeller speech writer. Their state salaries range from 19,942 to 54,288. Richard A. Bernstein, the Republican candidate for City Comptroller, says he still resides in Westchester County, although he established a voting residence on East 46th Street when he was designated by Republican county leaders last June. ''I live in Harrison - I live there now but I spend all my waking hours in the city,'' said Mr. Bernstein, who has already spent about 250,000 in advertising to make himself known to voters. He said that he would make the city his permanent residence if he were elected. The City Charter requires that the comptroller be a city resident. Alfred A. DelliBovi, the former Queens Assemblyman, has been appointed to a key patronage job in the Reagan Administration - regional director of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, which dispenses Federal mass transit aid. The post pays about 50,000. His most recent patronage post was on Assemblyman Emery's staff. Another Reagan supporter, Kieran O'Doherty, a founder of the Conservative Party, has been named Republican counsel to the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee at 51,000 a year. The post is viewed as a consolation prize for his losing an appointment as chairman of the United States Postal Rate Commission. President Reagan withdrew the nomination because of strong opposition within the commission to Mr. O'Doherty. Nassau County, which produced the largest vote of any county in the state last year, has a new Democratic county leader. He's Martin L. Mellman, a 62-year-old businessman and Port Washington resident who became active in poltiics because of his opposition to the Vietnam War. He was also affiliated with the liberal New Democratic Coalition and as such, is likely to be a liberal influence in state Democratic councils. Add three more names to the growing list of Republicans and Democrats who are tempted by Governor Carey's slump in the polls to run for Governor next year - either in a Democratic primary, if the Governor seeks renomination, or in the general election. The latest Democrats talking tough are Howard J. Samuels, who was a perennial candidate for Governor until he was defeated by Mr. Carey in the 1974 Democratic primary, and John S. Dyson, the outspoken chairman of the State Power Authority, who owes his job to the Governor. On the Republican side, Paul J. Curran, the former United States Attorney in Manhattan, said last week that he was ''considering getting involved.'' Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is one of those Democrats who might challenge Mr. Carey's renomination, said he is being scrupulous about an Oct. 21 fund-raising event at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel at which he hopes to net up to 75,000, at 500 a head. ''I don't want it running out of my office,'' he said. He added that he had set up an office at 330 West 42d Street and that Ell en Conovitz, of his staff, had come off the state payroll to run the event. Mr. Cuomo, who is known for fast speaking, said that he has also adopted a new personal style. ''My tongue is going to be a lot slower than my brain,'' he said. ''I've learned a lot. My opponents had an ally in the past - Cuomo. This time Cuomo is with me.'' Illustrations: photo of Assemblyman James L.

The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.

Soon after, I saw him walking toward the woods again. This went on for an hour. Finally I walked out of the house quietly and followed him. Billy cupped both hands in front of him as he walked, careful not to drop the water he carried. Leaves slapped his face but he kept walking into the woods. Then I saw an amazing sight. Several large deer stood in front of him. Billy walked right up to them. I saw a tiny baby deer lying on the ground. It was dying of thirst, and it lifted its head with great effort to drink the water in my boy's hands. When the water was gone, Billy ran back to the house. I followed him to the tap. Billy opened it and a small trickle  came out. He knelt down, letting the drops slowly fill up his \\"cup\\". Now I understood what was going on.

It's capital, Sapporo has hosted the winter olympics.","output":"The most northerly island of Japan is Hokkaido. This island, the second largest among the Japanese archipelago, lies to the north of the main island of Honshu and stretches up towards Russia. Hokkaido's vast expanses of wilderness and unspoiled natural landscapes offer a unique contrast to the bustling urban centers of Japan's other major islands. Hokkaido's capital, Sapporo, has indeed hosted the Winter Olympics. The 1972 Winter Olympics were held in Sapporo, marking the first time that this prestigious international sporting event took place in Asia. Sapporo was chosen as the host city due to its excellent winter sports facilities, reliable snowfall, and well-developed infrastructure. The city, located in the western part of Hokkaido, has a population of nearly 2 million people and is the island's largest city. The 1972 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XI Olympic Winter Games, comprised a total of 35 events across 6 different sports, including alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, ice hockey, figure skating, ski jumping, and speed skating. Athletes from 35 nations participated in the Games, with the Soviet Union, East Germany, and the United States emerging as the top performers. Hosting the Winter Olympics brought increased global recognition to Hokkaido and Sapporo, drawing attention to the region's natural beauty, renowned ski resorts, and unique cultural offerings. Hokkaido's abundant snowfall, coupled with its incredible landscape, has made the island a popular winter sports destination, both for professional athletes and recreational skiers and snowboarders from around the world.  In addition to its outdoor attractions, Hokkaido also offers visitors a rich cultural experience. The island is home to the indigenous Ainu people, who have inhabited the region for thousands of years and boast a unique culture influenced by their close relationship with the natural environment. Visitors can learn about the history and customs of the Ainu at various cultural centers, museums, and events across Hokkaido. In summary, Hokkaido is the most northerly island of Japan, known not only for its stunning landscapes and winter sports offerings but also for its rich cultural heritage. Its capital, Sapporo, hosted the Winter Olympics in 1972, bringing global recognition to the region and showcasing its beauty and attractions to the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By contrast, a pullover does not open in front but must be \\"pulled over\\" the head to be worn. It may be machine- or hand-knitted. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"A pullover hangs open like a cardigan.\\"?","output":"Based on the paragraph provided, we cannot conclude that \\"A pullover hangs open like a cardigan.\\" The paragraph states that a cardigan is a type of knitted garment that has an open front, which can either have buttons or be designed to hang open without buttons. Meanwhile, a pullover does not have an open front and must be worn by being \\"pulled over\\" the head. The main distinction between a cardigan and a pullover lies in their construction and the way they are worn. A cardigan is characterized by its open front, which allows the wearer to easily put it on or take it off, and offers a more versatile and adjustable layering option. This design feature provides an opportunity for the wearer to style the cardigan in different ways, such as buttoning it up completely or leaving it partially or completely unbuttoned to showcase the clothing underneath. On the other hand, a pullover is crafted as a single continuous piece without any opening at the front. In order to wear a pullover, one must pull it over their head, which makes it less versatile in terms of styling compared to a cardigan. Pullovers are usually worn as a snugger and warmer outer layer, providing insulation and coverage. They tend to have a more casual and sporty appearance compared to cardigans, which can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. In summary, the statement \\"A pullover hangs open like a cardigan\\" is inaccurate. These two types of garments differ in their construction and manner of wearing, with cardigans featuring an open front and pullovers having a closed design that is pulled over the wearer's head. Each type of garment offers unique styling options and serves different purposes in terms of fashion and functionality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If \\"Two people are on a snow-covered mountain.\\", does this mean that \\"People on a mountain.\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Two people are on a snow-covered mountain\\" does indeed imply that \\"People are on a mountain.\\" The original statement provides more specific details about the number of people (two) and the condition of the mountain being snow-covered. However, the general idea that there are people on a mountain still holds true in both statements. Let's break down the two statements further to explain the connection between them more thoroughly. 1. \\"Two people are on a snow-covered mountain.\\" This statement provides three crucial pieces of information:   a. There are two people involved in the situation.   b. The location is a mountain.   c. The mountain is covered with snow. The statement explicitly mentions the number \\"two,\\" which suggests that there are precisely two individuals present. The description of the mountain being \\"snow-covered\\" adds an essential detail that defines the environmental conditions. This information may be important in understanding the situation more accurately, such as the potential challenges or hazards these individuals might face in their snowy surroundings. 2. \\"People are on a mountain.\\" This statement is a simplified and more general version of the original statement. It omits the specific details about the number of people present and the snow-covered condition of the mountain. Nonetheless, the main idea remains the same – there are people on a mountain. By stating \\"People are on a mountain,\\" we acknowledge that humans are present in the given location, which is a mountain. However, the scope of this statement becomes more expansive in comparison to the original one. The number of individuals can range from one to multiple people, and the conditions of the mountain are no longer restricted to being snow-covered. In conclusion, the statement \\"Two people are on a snow-covered mountain\\" does support the general idea that \\"People are on a mountain.\\" The original statement simply offers more explicit information about the number of people and the condition of the mountain, while the latter statement is broader and more inclusive of different possible scenarios."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A kitten is still learning what is \\"normal.\\" If it learns at a young age that being handled and being sociable is \\"normal,\\" it's more likely to be a sociable cat who's willing to be petted by strangers. Work on petting the cat all over. Start with strokes the cat enjoys, such as pats on the head, and work up to stroking it all over. Try holding its paw for a few seconds, as well as its tail. After holding it for a few seconds, reward it with petting it likes. Keep working on to petting and touching areas it doesn't like as much. If the cat gets mad, it's time to stop and try again later.

Some areas have kitten classes specifically designed to help you socialize your cat. However, if your area doesn't, consider taking your kitten to friends' houses, where you let them calmly hold the kitten. Tell them to pet it softly and talk to it in a calm voice.

Background: Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases.  Paragraph: Jacob is performing a chemistry experiment using two different liquids. Before starting the experiment, Jacob is told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces. Jacob now has to decide how to use this information to guide  him as he develops the experimental procedures for these two liquids.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which liquid will have lower viscosity?

This might be called laziness, but Dr. Kleitman has a new explanation. He has proved that everyone has a daily energy cycle. During the hours when you labour through your work, you may say that you're \\"hot\\". That's true. The time of day when you feel most energetic is when your cycle of body temperature is at its peak. For some people that peak comes during the forenoon. For others it comes in the afternoon or evening. No one has discovered why this is so, but it leads to such familiar monologues  as \\"Get up , John ! You'll be late for work again !\\" The possible explanation to the trouble is that John is at his temperature-and-energy peak in the evening. Much family quarrelling ends when husbands and wives realize what these energy cycles mean, and which cycle each member of the family has. You can't change your energy cycle, but you can make your life fit it better. Habit can help. Dr. Kleitman believes. Maybe you're sleepy in the evening but feel you must stay up late anyway. Counteract your cycle to some extent by habitually staying up later than you want to . If your energy is low in the morning but you have an important job to do early in the day, rise before your usual hour. This won't change your cycle , but you'll get up steam and work better at your low point . Get off to a slow start which saves your energy. Get up with a yawn and stretch. Sit on the edge of the bed a minute before putting your feet on the floor. Avoid the troublesome search for clean clothes by laying them out the night before. Whenever possible, do routine work in the afternoon and save tasks requiring more energy for your sharper hours . Question: What's the best title of the passage?

What keeps Mars in orbit around the Sun? Select from: A). friction. B). gravity. C). magnetism. D). solar power.","output":"The answer is B: Gravity. Mars, just like any other planet in the solar system, remains in orbit around the Sun due to the force of gravity or gravitational attraction. This force of gravity, which the Sun exerts on Mars and, indeed, on all bodies in the solar system, results from the mass of the Sun and the distance between the Sun and Mars.  Let's explain further: Every object in the universe that has mass, whether it's a planet, a star, or even something as small as an apple, attracts every other object with a force known as gravity. This force was described by Sir Isaac Newton in his law of universal gravitation in 1687, which states that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. In the context of Mars and the Sun, the Sun, being substantially more massive than Mars or any other planet in our solar system, exerts a strong gravitational force which pulls objects towards its center. Mars, being affected by this gravitational pull, constantly falls towards the Sun.  However, because Mars is also moving laterally (that is, sideways relative to the Sun) at a high speed, it doesn't fall straight into the Sun, but rather falls around it. This creates a balance between the Sun's gravitational force pulling Mars in, and the planet's momentum pushing it out and keeps Mars traveling in a nearly circular path around the Sun. This path is what we call an \\"orbit\\". Of course, gravity isn't the only force at work in our solar system. There's also the centrifugal force, which is an apparent force that acts outward on a body moving around a center, arising from the body's inertia. In the case of Mars and the Sun, the centrifugal force due to Mars' orbital motion counteracts the Sun's gravitational pull and, in the absence of any other forces, keeps Mars moving in its orbit instead of falling into the Sun.  So the story of why Mars stays in orbit around the Sun is a tale of a delicate cosmic balance between gravity and inertia. To touch on the other options - friction, magnetism, and solar power - none of these have sufficient impact on a planet's orbit to keep it in place.  Friction, for instance, is a force that opposes motion. It's experienced when two surfaces slide past each other. In a vacuum of space, where there is no atmosphere, friction does not affect the motion of planets. Magnetism, while a force that exists between bodies, doesn't have a significant role in maintaining a planet's orbit around the Sun. The Sun does have a magnetic field, as does Mars, but their effects are minor compared to the gravitational forces. Solar power, which is a form of energy derived from the Sun's radiation, also does not directly contribute to holding planets in their orbits. Although solar radiation does exert a pressure, the force it exerts is extremely small compared to gravity. Therefore, its influence on the orbit of a planet like Mars is negligible.  The key force, therefore, is gravity - the force that makes the world, and indeed the universe, go around!"},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The Entropia Universe The Entropia Universe is a virtual world on the Internet, which seems very like our real life.It is set in a distant future and based on a planet called Calypso.Entropia was the brainchild of a group of Swedish computer lovers who decided to see if they could create a three dimensional   virtual world that could be placed on the Internet.They did manage after they received the financial backing they needed. The game can be played for free, but nearly all in-game activities require personal resources that you have available to use.Although there are various activities to keep you busy on Calypso, what most people do first is to find themselves a profession, such as hunting the fierce animals on Calypso, mining the precious minerals and making tools.Then they can think about buying their virtual house or paying a visit to a virtual nightclub or doing any of the other activities that make life bearable. Entropia has its very own economy   and its own currency, the PED (Project Entropia Dollars).Players move real world money into PED which they then use to pay for their life on Calypso.However, the virtual things inside Entropia do have a real value in the outside world, and careful business deals mean that players can actually make real money there.PED can be changed into dollars any time at a rate of 10PED to 1US. What's so impressive about The Entropia Universe is the number of players; currently more than 600,000 representing over 220 countries from planet Earth.A number of players insist that it's a good way to make money.However, the reality of Entropia's economic system is that most people end up paying more than they earn and it's not uncommon to find players who are paying up to 200 a month into their PED account.This might not be the most economical way of spending one's free time.However, some people say that for them the fact that they can escape the realities of the earthbound life and become a different person with a completely different life for a few hours every week is...

Background: Jarrod Vincenzo Rebecchi (commonly known as \\"Toadfish\\" or \\"Toadie\\") is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Ryan Moloney. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 23 January 1995. Toadie was created by writer Elizabeth Packett. Moloney had previously auditioned for another role in the show and had played a minor character, before being cast as Toadie. Context: Toadie's nickname was derived from the toadfishes of Australia. The serial's official website described a young Toadie as \\"fun-loving, mischievous and the class clown.\\" TV Week branded Toadie \\"another troubled-teen-turned-good\\" who was \\"fond of a practical joke\\". Soap opera reporting website, Holy Soap, said he was \\"initially a bit of a layabout\\" that \\"got his act together and qualified as a lawyer.\\" He also observed him as coming in \\"as a rough bloke and now he's a nancy.\\" Toadie is portrayed as an \\"unlucky in love character\\". He would often be played as the \\"third-wheel\\" alongside Billy Kennedy (Jesse Spencer), who was more popular with female characters. In 2003, Moloney said: \\"Billy always got the chicks and it annoyed me because I wanted a chance at pashing someone... and now it's all making up for lost time.\\" Moloney said when Toadie is \\"not in love and when he's not heartbroken\\" he has the ability to do anything he wants.  Toadie's persona is similar to Moloney's in the sense that they both \\"mess around\\". He further added, \\"In fact he is me, seeing how much fun and frivolity I can get away with.\\" Molony documented Toadie changing from \\"a bit of a bad boy\\" into a \\"lawyer who's supposedly a responsible member of the community.\\" He felt that to begin with Toadie was not a good lawyer, because many his clients would receive prison sentences. On Toadie's professionalism, Moloney said he is the type of lawyer that \\"probably likes to take his pants off behind the desk.\\"  Toadie's image has changed repeatedly during his tenure. When he first appeared in 1995, he had long hair. He used to style a mullet similar to Scott Robinson's (Jason Donovan) hairstyle. Moloney jested that it appeared as though a possum was on his head. Question: What was his humor like? Answer:","output":"Toadie's humor was like a fun-loving, mischievous class clown. He liked to play practical jokes and mess around, making people laugh and having a good time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a detailed comparison and explanation of the two sentences: 1. U.S. troops encountered no resistance during the five-hour sweep near Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown and the center of a region of Baath Party supporters. This sentence highlights the following key points: - U.S. troops were involved in an activity called a \\"sweep\\" (presumably a military operation). - The sweep lasted five-hours and took place \\"near\\" Tikrit. - Tikrit is identified explicitly as Saddam Hussein's hometown. - The region around Tikrit is described as the \\"center\\" of a larger region that supports the Baath Party. 2. Tikrit is Saddam Hussein's hometown and the region around it is known as a hotbed of Baath Party supporters and former high-ranking Iraqi military officials. This sentence focuses on the following aspects: - Tikrit is again identified clearly as Saddam Hussein's hometown. - The region surrounding Tikrit is identified explicitly as a \\"hotbed\\" of Baath Party supporters, thus emphasizing the high concentration of such supporters there. - Unlike the first sentence, this sentence also adds that former high-ranking Iraqi military officials are in the area. This detail provides more context about the region and may indicate the strategic importance of Tikrit and its surroundings. While both sentences emphasize that Tikrit is Saddam Hussein's hometown and a region populated by Baath Party supporters, they differ in their focus. The first sentence offers more information about the military operation conducted by the U.S. troops near Tikrit. In contrast, the second sentence provides a more detailed description of the region by adding the presence of former high-ranking Iraqi military officials. Although there are minor dissimilarities in the details, both sentences convey that Tikrit is the center of a region that has strong associations with Saddam Hussein and Baath Party supporters, thus communicating a common main idea."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There is no mention of gender restrictions or limitations, or indeed, any restrictions at all with regard to accessing or viewing the list.  Therefore, it cannot be inferred that only men are allowed to see the list. This statement might stem from a misconception that the military, especially areas like Air Force Test Squadrons, are male-dominated. Whilst the military has historically been a male-dominated field, this has changed over time and many armed forces, including the U.S. Air Force, now include women in many roles. Women serve in a variety of roles from administrative and support roles to combat and flight roles, including in test squadrons. Furthermore, information about military units, including Air Force squadrons, is typically not classified or restricted based on gender. There certainly may be specific pieces of information within a military or government context that are classified or restricted, but these restrictions are typically not based on gender, but on factors such as personnel security clearance levels, a need-to-know basis, and other operational or security considerations.

Question: Who wants to get rid of all of Mike's things? Title: 100 Feet Movie plot: The film begins with Marnie Watson (Famke Jannsen) being driven home in a New York City police car. She stands outside for a few seconds, before going in to the house. Shanks (Bobby Cannavale), the cop escorting her, tells her not to get used to fresh air. He lets her in to the hall, and Shanks tears off the police crime scene tape that had been left there. After they get inside, someone comes to fit her ankle bracelet, and they tell her she cannot move more than 100 feet from the detector in the hallway. Shanks treats Marnie quite badly, telling her she will remain in the house until her sentence is up. He tells her to clean up some blood from the wall, and that she will have lots of time to think about what she did. Marnie argues with him, telling him that if the police had taken her crime reports seriously, her husband would still be alive today. The cynical Shanks leaves with indifference.Later that day, Marnie takes all of her husband's pictures, and belongings, and puts them in her basement, where the detector goes off. She then paints over the blood in the wall. She calls the power company about having her power restored, and they tell her they can't make it until Monday, so she has to light some candles. Later that night, she is in bed, and hears footsteps, but it turns out to be a cat.She continues to hear the footsteps, and goes downstairs, where she finds a homeless man, and threatens to stab him if he doesn't leave. The next day, a local delivery boy, Joey (Ed Westwick) arrives, and brings her shopping over. He tells her he lives in the same street, and compliments her house. She tells him she needs him to come by regularly, and he says he will do it for the tips. Marnie watches him leave, with a look of lust in her eyes.Later that night, she is going upstairs, when the ghost of her husband, Mike Watson (Michael Paré) pushes her down the stairs.

Q: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of single whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) session applied prior to submaximal exercise on the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the concentration of lipid peroxidation products, total oxidative status, and the level of cytokines in blood of volleyball players. The study group consisted of 18 male professional volleyball players, who were subjected to extremely cold air (-130°C) prior to exercise performed on cycloergometer. Blood samples were taken five times: before WBC, after WBC procedure, after exercise preceded by cryotherapy (WBC exercise), and before and after exercise without WBC (control exercise). The activity of catalase statistically significantly increased after control exercise. Moreover, the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase was lower after WBC exercise than after control exercise (P < 0.001). After WBC exercise, the level of IL-6 and IL-1β was also lower (P < 0.001) than after control exercise. The obtained results may suggest that cryotherapy prior to exercise may have some antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The relations between the level of studied oxidative stress and inflammatory markers may testify to the contribution of reactive oxygen species in cytokines release into the blood system in response to exercise and WBC.

Smaller, free and with loads of walks and picnic areas, I sent my intrepid husband ahead to brave the canyon bridge whilst I sipped a much-needed coffee in the local cafe. It was beautiful. It’s mostly because the thought of hopping onto a swaying bridge above the ravine gives me the heebie-jeebies, whereas he will stride across panels of transparent glass suspended metres above busy streets (like Tower Bridge) or gondola rides that skim well above the treetops (like Japan lake or the Bavarian Alpine range.)

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?  Context: Simon Corbell (born 21 November 1970) is a former Australian politician and Deputy Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory. He was also Attorney-General, Minister for Health, Minister for the Environment and Minister for the Capital Metro. Hypothesis: Simon Corbell is a former politician because he was voted out of office.","output":"While it is possible that Simon Corbell is a former politician due to being voted out of office, the context provided does not contain sufficient information to support or confirm this hypothesis. There could be a variety of reasons why a politician might no longer hold office, and merely stating that Corbell is a former politician does not identify the specific reason for his career transition. Let's consider alternative explanations, and discuss why the given hypothesis may not be definitive. 1. Voluntary retirement: Simon Corbell might have decided to retire from politics voluntarily after serving for a particular duration or accomplishing certain goals. It is not uncommon for politicians to leave office after several years, especially if they have a desire to explore other career opportunities or spend more time with their family. 2. Term limits: Some jurisdictions have term limits in place, which could limit the number of terms a politician can serve in a specific position or capacity. If this was the case, Corbell would have had to leave office regardless of his popularity or success as a politician. 3. Change in personal circumstances: A change in personal, health, or family circumstances may have led Corbell to step down from his political role. For example, he might have faced health issues that made it challenging to carry on with the demanding responsibilities of his role. Alternatively, he might have needed to support loved ones during a personal or family crisis. 4. Redirection of career: Corbell may have decided to redirect his career and focus on other opportunities that matched his skills and interests. He might have moved to another governmental position or even switched to the private sector to pursue other professional goals. 5. Losing party support: Politicians often need the support of their political party to run for office, and sometimes a party may decide to endorse another candidate for the position. In that case, the politician may still be active in the political sphere, but not in an elected capacity. In summary, while it is possible that Simon Corbell is a former politician because he was voted out of office, this hypothesis cannot be drawn conclusively from the provided context. The context only establishes that Corbell is a former politician and lists some of the roles he held in office. We would need more information to determine the specific reason for the end of his political career."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5.

Here's a detailed explanation: The text of the tweet reads, \\"can't sleep....playing on facebook and twitter....going to be a long day tomorrow.\\" There are several cues in this tweet that indicate a negative sentiment: 1. \\"can't sleep\\": This statement expresses frustration or irritation due to the inability to fall asleep. Not being able to sleep is typically considered a negative experience and could affect someone's mood adversely. 2. \\"playing on facebook and twitter\\": The use of the continuous tense \\"playing\\" implies that the person is browsing social media aimlessly, possibly seeking diversion or distraction from their inability to sleep. This further reinforces the negative tone of the tweet, as it suggests a lack of fulfillment or dissatisfaction with the current situation. 3. \\"going to be a long day tomorrow\\": This statement anticipates that the upcoming day will be challenging or tiring, likely due to sleep deprivation.

In the fanfily traditional cultural patterns confer (~z~,) leadership on one or both of the parents. In other cases, such as friendship groups, one or more persons may gradually emerge as leaders, although there is no formal process of selection. In larger groups, leaders are usually chosen formally through election or recruitment. Although leaders are often thought to be people with unusual personal ability, decades of research have failed to produce consistent evidence that there is any category of \\"natural leaders.\\" It seems that there is no set of personal qualities that all leaders have in common; rather, virtually any person may be recognized as a leader if the person has qualities that meet the needs of that particular group. Furthermore, although it is commonly supposed that social groups have a single leader, research suggests that there are typically two different leadership roles that are held by different individuals. Instrumental leadership is leadership that emphasizes the completion of tasks by a social group. Group members look to instrumental leaders to \\"get things done.\\" Expressive leadership, on the other hand, is leadership that emphasizes the collective well-beings of a social group's members. Expressive leaders are less concerned with the overall goals of the group than with providing emotional support to group members and attempting to minimize tension and conflict among them. Group members expect expressive leaders to maintain stable relationships within the group and provide support to individual members.

Moreover, the app offers unique features such as self-destructing messages and secret chat, ensuring privacy and data protection. The variety of emojis and stickers keeps messaging entertaining and engaging. Additionally, the option to customize chats with themes, colors, and backgrounds adds a personal touch to conversations. However, there are a few minor issues which prevent me from giving it a perfect score.

Here are possible answers to this question: - starting fire - illumination - heat - make fire - frustration  I believe the correct choice is \\"illumination\\", here's why: A:","output":"I agree that the correct choice is \\"illumination.\\" Here's a step-by-step justification for this choice: 1. Consider the context: Lighting a match in a dark tunnel suggests that the primary goal is to improve visibility in the dim environment. 2. Evaluate the options:     - Starting fire: While a match can be used to start a fire, in a dark tunnel, starting a fire may not be the primary purpose, as there is no information on any materials that need ignition. Moreover, a fire inside a tunnel could be dangerous.    - Illumination: This is the most logical option, given the context. A match produces a small flame that can provide temporary light, making it easier to navigate the tunnel and improve visibility.    - Heat: Although a match does produce heat, the amount is too small for providing significant warmth in a tunnel. Also, the match would burn out quickly, so the heat benefit would be minimal.    - Making fire: This option is similar to \\"starting fire,\\" and faces the same issue that there's no mention of materials or reasons to start a fire. Plus, it has the same safety concerns.    - Frustration: This choice doesn't seem as plausible, because lighting matches out of frustration is not a common or reasonable response to stress or dismay. 3.

I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening.

Answer the following question. Who first popularised the story of Dr Faustus in England?","output":"The story of Dr Faustus was first popularised in England by the renowned playwright Christopher Marlowe, who was a contemporary of William Shakespeare. Born in 1564 in Canterbury, England, Marlowe was an influential figure in the Elizabethan era, known for his dramatic works and his exploration of complex human experiences through his characters. Christopher Marlowe adapted the story of Dr Faustus into a play titled \\"The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus,\\" often simply referred to as \\"Doctor Faustus\\" or “Dr. Faustus.” The play was based on the German Faustbuch, which in turn drew from the historical accounts of Johann Georg Faust, a German scholar, alchemist, and magician who lived in the early 16th century. The Faustbuch was translated into English by an anonymous author in 1592 under the title \\"The Historie of the Damnable Life, and Deserved Death of Doctor John Faustus.\\" Marlowe's \\"Doctor Faustus\\" was written around 1588-1593, but the exact date of composition remains uncertain. The play became highly popular and influential in its time, and it continues to be performed and studied to this day. It is recognized as one of Marlowe's most significant works and contributed to his posthumous fame as an important figure in English literature. In Marlowe's version of the Faust story, Dr. John Faustus is a learned scholar who becomes dissatisfied with the limits of traditional knowledge. He decides to delve into the realm of forbidden arts, namely necromancy, in order to gain unsurpassed knowledge, power, and pleasure. Faustus makes a deal with the devil, selling his soul in exchange for 24 years of service from a demonic servant named Mephistopheles. Throughout the play, Dr. Faustus becomes increasingly corrupted by his newfound abilities and indulges in various sinful acts, all the while confronted by the moral and theological debates around his decision. The play is particularly famous for its exploration of these themes, as well as for its striking portrayal of the internal and external conflicts that define Faustus's tragic character. As the 24 years come to an end, Dr. Faustus becomes desperate to escape his impending doom. However, despite being presented with opportunities to repent and save his soul, he ultimately succumbs to despair and is dragged to hell by demonic forces in a powerful and much-debated climax. Christopher Marlowe's \\"Doctor Faustus\\" played a crucial role in popularising the story of Dr. Faustus in England, conveying complex themes of ambition, morality, theological debate, and the human condition. The play's impact on the world of theatre and literature over the centuries is a testament to Marlowe's important contribution to early modern English drama and the lasting appeal of the Faustian legend."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.

He turns to the audience and explains that his wife, Sweetypuss, told him that if he didn't bring home a roast duck for dinner, she would 'cook (his) goose'.

A shadow of Meek is show getting ready to chop off Daffy's head. Then he jumps and shouts \\"WATCH IT, BUB!!!\\" directly in his face. After a brief talk to Meek, he flicks his beak at his face and marches to a hay stack. Meek chops the stack various times and on the last chop, he thinks he kills the duck. Daffy fakes his death by squirting ketchup and throwing his feathers around (\\"You crushed my little head!\\") This fools Meek by pretending he is beheaded and runs rapidly. Meek feels sad and goes back to his house, where Daffy is seen putting lots of sugar cubes into a cup of coffee. Meek guiltily tells him that he has killed a duck. Daffy cheers up Meek into giving him a cup of coffee and asks how many lumps (of sugar) his wife usually gives him. Meek shows Daffy a 'lump' (a bump on his head), and Daffy hits him on the head (giving him another 'lump') and pours cream on it. Daffy dances on the cakes and pies, singing \\"Shortening Bread\\", and Meek immediately recognizes the duck he thought he killed (\\"Say.

Daffy goes into army plane mode, by dropping an egg on Meek as a \\"Secret Bomb Site.\\" Next, he goes into battle weaponry mode, by making various sounds and smashing household items.

He is a Professor of English at the University of Southern California. He explains that there are just a few areas left on Earth that are unknown and briefly describes a few theories that postulate there may be places deep under the surface of the Earth where man can survive.In Asia an archeological dig has discovered something. Dr. Roger Bentley (John Agar) and Prof. Etienne Lafarge (Nestor Paiva) expose a stone tablet. They take it back to their tent to clean and examine it.

An earthquake rattles the area and the tablet is broken. This puts their work a month behind schedule. A small boy discovers something the earthquake brought down a mountain and brings it to Bentley.

This question involves two standalone sentences, \\"Mommy Dearest\\" and \\"Beautiful mama\\", with no logical or factual connection established between them. \\"Mommy Dearest\\" is an affectionate term for a mother. On the other hand, \\"Beautiful mama\\" seems to be another form of endearment, suggesting that the speaker finds the mother to be attractive. However, without additional context or information, we cannot infer the truth of the second sentence from the first one. The truth of \\"Beautiful mama\\" relies on an entirely separate measure - the speaker's perception of the mother's beauty, which is subjective and not necessarily tied to the use of an endearing term like \\"Mommy Dearest\\". Furthermore, the term \\"beautiful\\" can have different interpreters, it can refer to physical attractiveness, but it can also denote admiration for someone's character or qualities. Hence, without an explicit connection between these two statements, we cannot definitively say that if the first statement is true, then the second statement is also true.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the linear equation -51*b + 185 = 106*b + 55*b - 27*b for b, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side of the equation -51*b is the only term containing b, so it stays. On the right side of the equation, we have three terms containing b: 106*b, 55*b, and -27*b. Combine those terms: 106*b + 55*b - 27*b Add the coefficients: 106 + 55 - 27 = 134 So, the simplified term is: 134*b Now, the equation becomes: -51*b + 185 = 134*b Step 2: Isolate b. To isolate b, move the terms containing b to one side of the equation, and move the constants to the other side. To move -51*b to the right side of the equation, we need to add 51*b to both sides of the equation. The equation becomes: 185 = 134*b + 51*b Combine like terms: 185 = (134 + 51)*b 185 = 185*b Now, divide both sides by 185 to isolate b:  b = 185/185 Step 3: Solve for b.

Information:  - Atyidae is a family of shrimp, present in all tropical and most temperate waters of the world. Adults of this family are almost always confined to fresh water. This is the only family in the superfamily Atyoidea.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia. The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity. Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions:  - The telson is the posterior-most division of the body of an arthropod. It is not considered a true segment because it does not arise in the embryo from teloblast areas as do real segments. It never carries any appendages, but a forked \\"tail\\" called the caudal furca may be present. The shape and composition of the telson differs between arthropod groups.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans.  Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments.  - A subregion is a part of a larger region or continent and is usually based on location. Cardinal directions, such as south or southern, are commonly used to define a subregion.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - Atya is a genus of freshwater shrimp of the family Atyidae, ranging through the Antilles and along the Atlantic and Pacific slopes of Central and South America and in western Africa. It contains the following species:  - Atyopsis is a genus of freshwater shrimp from Southeast Asia . It was erected in 1983 by Fenner A. Chace , Jr. for two species formerly treated in the genus Atya . It differs from Atya by various characters , including the form of the telson ( which is longest at the corners in Atyopsis , but not in Atya ) and the presence of a \`\` massive spur '' on the male third pereiopod . The genus comprises two species , Atya spinipes and Atyopsis moluccensis . No fossil representatives are known . They are found on high islands from Sri Lanka to the Samoan Islands , and as far north as Okinawa , as well as on the Asian mainland from the Malay Peninsula to India . The two species differ in the number of teeth on the underside of the rostrum , A. spinipes having 2 -- 6 , while A. moluccensis has 7 -- 16 . When kept in the aquarium this species prefers to have a moderate water flow . This shrimp feeds using its feather like claspers to filter particles from the water . If food is scarce you may find them foraging through the substrate . Like any other crustacean the bamboo shrimp will molt in order to grow . During this process the shrimp is very vulnerable to predation so ample hiding spaces should be provided e.g. small cave structures , dense foliage , etc.    What object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'atyopsis'?

We first need to get rid of the 1294 on the left side. So, we will subtract 1294 from both sides: 54*g + 1294 - 1294 =  -1352 - 1294 Now it will look like this: 54*g = -2646 Now, to find 'g', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 54: (54*g) / 54 = -2646 / 54 It simplifies to: g = -49 So the answer is g = -49.

Write highlights for this article: British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has issued a posthumous apology for the \\"appalling\\" treatment of Alan Turing, the British code-breaker who was chemically castrated for being gay. A portrait of Alan Turing is currently on display at the National Portrait Gallery's \\"Gay Icons\\" exhibition. The apology came after more than 30,000 people signed an online petition on the UK Government Web site calling for the government to recognize the \\"tragic consequences of prejudice that ended this man's life and career.\\" Turing was just 41 years old when he committed suicide, two years after undergoing a court-ordered chemical castration. He had been found guilty of gross indecency for having a homosexual relationship. The punishment in 1952 was either a prison sentence or chemical castration. Turing chose the latter. In a statement on the British Government Web site, Prime Minister Gordon Brown acknowledged Turing's \\"outstanding\\" contribution during World War II. \\"He truly was one of those individuals we can point to whose unique contribution helped to turn the tide of war,\\" he wrote, adding, \\"The debt of gratitude he is owed makes it all the more horrifying, therefore, that he was treated so inhumanely.\\" Turing is considered one of Britain's greatest mathematicians, a genius who is credited with inventing the Bombe, a code-breaking machine that deciphered messages encoded by German Enigma machines during World War II. He went on to develop the Turing machine, a theory that automatic computation cannot solve all mathematical problems, which is considered the basis of modern computing. Last month, the curious lack of public recognition for Turing's contribution to the war effort and computing in general motivated computer programmer John Graham-Cumming to campaign on his behalf. The author of the \\"Geek Atlas,\\" a travel guide for technology enthusiasts, started an online petition, and soon attracted high-profile signatories including scientist Richard Dawkins, actor Stephen Fry, author Ian McEwan and philosopher A.C.

Voters in Pennsylvania head to the polls Tuesday in a special congressional election with national implications for President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats. The election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November. The race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally. Republicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains. In making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea.  But Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November. \\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \\"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Mel Funn (Brooks), a great film director now recovering from a drinking problem and down on his luck, sets out to pitch a new screenplay idea to the Chief of Big Picture Studios (Caesar), aided by his assistants Dom Bell (DeLuise) and Marty Eggs (Feldman). The screenplay is for the first major silent motion picture in forty years. At first the studio chief, who is in danger of losing the studio to the New York conglomerate Engulf & Devour, rejects the idea, but Funn convinces him that if he can get Hollywood's biggest stars to be in the film, he could save the studio.Funn, Eggs, and Bell proceed to recruit Burt Reynolds, James Caan, Liza Minnelli, Anne Bancroft, and Paul Newman (all played by themselves) to be in their silent film in various comic ways. They also ask world famous mime Marcel Marceau (also as himself) to be in the film, but he replies, \\"Non\\", the only spoken word in the entire film. Funn claims not to understand Marceau's reply because he \\"do[es]n't understand French.\\"Meanwhile, Engulf (Harold Gould) and Devour (Ron Carey) worry that Funn will save Big Picture Studios, and they will be unable to buy it. They attempt to \\"stop Funn with sex\\", by sending Vilma Kaplan (Peters) to seduce Funn, and then pretend to fall in love with him. Funn falls in love with her, but realizes the truth the day before the filming of the movie is set to begin, and returns to drinking. Vilma, who has actually fallen for Funn during the course of their relationship, teams up with Eggs and Bell to find Funn and get him sober.Vilma, Eggs, and Bell locate Funn and feed him several hundred cups of coffee to sober him up. Funn is able to direct, and the movie is filmed on schedule, but the film is stolen from the theater by Engulf & Devour just before its preview. Funn and his associates steal it back while Vilma distracts the audience with her Cabaret act, and after a slapstick car chase and final showdown involving cans of soda being launched like grenades, return the film to the theater, where it is a huge success,... Answer:","output":"Considering the movie plot presented, which explores the challenges faced by Mel Funn and his assistants as they try to save Big Picture Studios from being taken over by Engulf & Devour, how does their pursuit to create the first major silent motion picture in forty years highlight the importance of preserving silver screen history and the creative process involved in recruiting Hollywood's biggest stars to achieve their goal?

He read a lot in his spare time and at nineteen he was given the job of superintendent  at a Manchester cotton mill. He was so successful there that he persuaded his employer to buy the New Lanark mill in Scotland. When he arrived at New Lanark it was a dirty little town with a population of 2,000 people. Nobody paid any attention to the workers' houses or their children's education. The conditions in the factories were very bad. There was a lot of crime and the men spent most of their wages on alcoholic drinks. Owen improved the houses. He encouraged people to be clean and save money. He opened a shop and sold the workers cheap, well-made goods to help them. He limited the sale of alcoholic drinks. Above all, he fixed his mind on the children's education. In 1816 he opened the first free primary school in Britain. People came from all over the country to visit Owen's factory. They saw that the workers were healthier and more efficient than in other towns. Their children were better fed and better educated. Owen tried the same experiment in the United States. He bought some land there in 1825, but the community was too far away. He could not keep it under control and lost most of his money. Owen never stopped fighting for his idea. Above all he believed that people are not born good or bad. He was a practical man and his ideas were practical. \\"If you give people good working conditions\\", he thought, \\"they will work well and, the most important thing of all, if you give them the chance to learn, they will be better people.\\" From the passage we may infer that Owen was born   _  .

Translate this to English?","output":"Organizations have established monitoring mechanisms that allow them to track non-mandatory appointments and expired exemption periods. Organizations, in order to ensure the efficiency and integrity of their operations, have set up specific monitoring mechanisms. These mechanisms are put in place to follow non-mandatory appointments, which are essentially appointments that are not required by any regulation or rule, but can be made based on the preference or convenience of the organization. This can include temporary or provisional appointments that may be subject to review and change in the future. In addition, these monitoring mechanisms also keep track of expired exemption periods. Exemption periods refer to the specified durations in which certain rules, requirements, or obligations are suspended or relaxed for particular reasons. These can include factors such as special circumstances, employee needs, or the needs of the organization itself. Once these exemption periods come to an end, the related rules, requirements, or obligations are reinstated, and the concerned parties must comply with them accordingly. The purpose of having these monitoring mechanisms in place is to maintain a clear record of such appointments and exemptions in the organization. This is important to prevent any potential issues, discrepancies, and confusion that might arise due to lapses in oversight. By consistently monitoring these aspects, organizations can ensure that they operate within the bounds of their established guidelines, policies, and best practices while still allowing for flexibility and adaptability as needed. Having such detailed and long-term oversight also allows organizations to evaluate the effectiveness of their current processes, identify any trends or patterns, and make more informed decisions regarding potential changes or improvements. This continuous evaluation and monitoring not only contribute to the overall success and growth of the organization but also helps maintain a fair and transparent working environment for all its members."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Explanation: The paragraph is about the author's feelings regarding her husband being deployed to Afghanistan instead of Iraq and how grateful she is that, in her family's history and memories, Iraq isn't a part of it. Hence it logically follows to continue the unfinished sentence with \\"Iraq baggage in my family\\". - The option \\"Afghanistan baggage in my family\\" is not accurate because the author expresses gratitude that her husband was deployed to Afghanistan. - The options \\"Americans baggage in my family\\", \\"CNN baggage in my family\\", \\"Rebekah Sanderlin baggage in my family\\", and \\"Sanderlin baggage in my family\\" do not make logical sense considering the context of the paragraph.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: mist rising on a cold morning","output":"In the sentence \\"mist rising on a cold morning,\\" the most important words are: 1. Mist: \\"Mist\\" is a natural phenomenon that occurs when tiny water droplets are suspended in the air, creating a thin, hazy veil that reduces visibility. The presence of mist in the sentence evokes a sense of the weather, setting, and atmosphere. 2. Rising: The verb \\"rising\\" implies the upward movement of the mist. This is significant in creating a visual image and understanding the dynamic nature of the scene. The word also suggests the gradual emergence of the mist as the morning progresses, adding an element of time and change to the scenery. 3. Cold: The adjective \\"cold\\" provides essential information about the temperature and the overall feel of the morning. Cold often elicits physical sensations and emotions, such as shivering or the desire to stay warm indoors. Including \\"cold\\" helps paint the picture of a chilly morning, setting the tone for the scene and evoking a specific ambiance. 4. Morning: \\"Morning\\" identifies the time of day and sets the temporal context for the scene. Mornings symbolize beginnings, fresh starts, and often coincide with the sun rising. Incorporating \\"morning\\" into the sentence endows the image with a sense of renewal and awakening. It also gives insight into the natural cycle of the day, as the mist tends to be more prevalent in the early hours, especially on cold mornings. Taken together, these four words – \\"mist,\\" \\"rising,\\" \\"cold,\\" and \\"morning\\" – form the crux of the sentence, capturing the essence of the scene. Each of these words carries significant weight in presenting the reader with a clear, evocative image and successfully communicates the intended atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The memorial service for Justice Antonin Scalia concludes at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington.      Feb. 20, 2016 The memorial service for Justice Antonin Scalia concludes at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post      Scalia is laid to rest at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington.      Scalia is laid to rest at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington.      Scalia is laid to rest at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington.      A Texas sheriff’s department released an incident report late Tuesday that revealed new details of the discovery of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s body, as well as the name of the friend who accompanied him on the hunting trip and the items found inside the ranch bedroom where the justice was found.      In response to a public records request made by The Washington Post, the Presidio County Sheriff’s Office released an incident report from the sheriff’s investigation of Scalia’s death at the Cibolo Creek Ranch on Feb. 13. The report stated that the justice’s body was found in bed with a pillowcase covering his eyes. A breathing apparatus was on the table next to the bed, but it was switched off. Scalia was lying on three pillows “stacked up to elevate his head.”      [Read the incident report here]      Scalia’s sheets and pillows “were still in the creased position from that day’s room service, indicating that there was no struggle involved,” the report said. The top pillowcase “appeared to have shifted at some point in the night due to the weight of his pillow, causing the pillow case to slide down and cover his eyes.”      The sheriff noted that the position of the pillow “did not seem to have inhibited Scalia’s breathing.”      Antonin Scalia died on Saturday, Feb. 13. Here's a look back on his tenure, his judicial philosophy and the legacy he leaves behind. (Monica Akhtar,Natalie Jennings/The Washington Post)      About 12:14 p.m., the owner of the ranch, John Poindexter, called Presidio County Sheriff Danny Dominguez to report the death but would not give him the name of the deceased person. There was then a disagreement between them about who should handle the death report. Poindexter told Dominguez that he wanted to report the death to the U.S. Marshals Service, but Dominguez said that it was under his jurisdiction.      “He then stated to me that this death was way beyond my authority and that it should go the Feds (USMS),” Dominguez said in the report. “I then replied it doesn’t matter who it is, it was still under my jurisdiction.”      Dominguez called U.S. Marshal Ken Roberts, and they agreed to meet at the ranch, south of Marfa, Tex. The sheriff arrived about 12:35 p.m.      When Dominguez arrived, he met Poindexter and Allen Foster, who is described in the report as “a close friend of Scalia” who had flown in with him the day before.      C. Allen Foster is a prominent Washington lawyer who has argued before the Supreme Court. It was not immediately clear whether C. Allen Foster was the Scalia friend referred to in the report. A representative from his law firm said that he was traveling and that she would try to reach him.      Since Scalia’s death at the remote West Texas ranch, questions have been raised about how the death investigation was handled and why an autopsy wasn’t performed on the 79-year-old Supreme Court justice.      The Presidio County judge and the manager of the funeral home that handled Scalia’s body said Scalia’s family insisted on not having an autopsy done.      Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)      Scalia suffered from coronary artery disease, obesity, diabetes and other ailments, according to a letter from his Supreme Court doctor.      Presidio County District Attorney Rod Ponton told the Associated Press there was nothing suspicious about Scalia’s death and cited a letter from Rear Adm. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician for members of Congress and the Supreme Court. The Feb. 16 letter said Scalia’s many “significant medical conditions led to his death,” Ponton said.      Monahan listed ailments including “sleep apnea, degenerative joint disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and high blood pressure,” the AP said. Scalia was also a smoker, the letter said.      According to the Presidio County sheriff’s report, Poindexter, Foster and the ranch manager took Dominguez to the room where Scalia died.      “All seemed to be in order,” he wrote. Scalia was face-up on the bed, covered with sheets up to his chin. Both of his hands were “resting at his side.”      A hose for the breathing machine was found on the left side of Scalia’s bed, but was not attached to him. Scalia’s briefcase was found closed, on a recliner. On the kitchen counter, the sheriff found a “blue stretch band exercise device.” A shaving kit was on the counter in the bathroom. And his shoes were placed next to the bathtub.      Scalia’s suitcase was open, and the contents were neatly folded. A shirt was folded on the sofa. On the table to the right of his bed, the sheriff found a flashlight and a pitcher of water with a napkin folded over the top. On a table in the room, there was an “orange cap, a set of keys, a pen, a watch, and a bottle of water.”      Poindexter and Foster told the sheriff that Scalia had arrived at the ranch the day before to go hunting. Poindexter has told reporters that about 35 guests were at the ranch for the weekend together.      Poindexter told the sheriff that they “had supper and talked for a while” that evening.      Scalia “said that he was tired and was going to his room for the night,” the sheriff wrote in his report. ||||| FILE - In this Oct. 18, 2011 file photo, U.S. Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia looks into the balcony before addressing the Chicago-Kent College Law justice in Chicago.

(Associated Press)      FILE - In this Oct. 18, 2011 file photo, U.S. Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia looks into the balcony before addressing the Chicago-Kent College Law justice in Chicago. A letter from the Supreme Court's doctor says Scalia suffered from coronary artery disease, obesity and diabetes, among other ailments... (Associated Press)      DALLAS (AP) — Antonin Scalia suffered from coronary artery disease, obesity and diabetes, among other ailments that probably contributed to the justice's sudden death, according to a letter from the Supreme Court's doctor.      Presidio County District Attorney Rod Ponton cited the letter Tuesday when he told The Associated Press there was nothing suspicious about the Feb. 13 death of the 79-year-old jurist. He said the long list of health problems made an autopsy unnecessary.      Ponton had a copy of the letter from Rear Adm. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician for members of Congress and the Supreme Court. The letter was to Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara, who conducted a death inquiry by phone and certified Scalia's death.      The letter dated Feb. 16 said Scalia's many \\"significant medical conditions led to his death,\\" Ponton said.      In the letter, Monahan listed more than a half-dozen ailments, including sleep apnea, degenerative joint disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and high blood pressure. Scalia also was a smoker, the letter said.      Ponton declined to provide a copy of the letter, saying an open-records request must be made to Guevara.      The AP filed a records request with the judge last week, but she did not provide the letter or respond to a reporter's phone message Tuesday. The Texas Department of State Health Services has declined to release a copy of the death certificate.      Scalia was found dead in his bed at the Cibolo Creek Ranch, not far from the Mexico border, where he had gone on a hunting trip.      Dr. Mark Hlatky, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford University, said a 79-year-old man with those conditions, especially coronary artery disease and sleep apnea, would be at risk for a potentially fatal heart arrhythmia.      \\"A lot of people do die in their sleep, and they're found the next day.\\"      The conditions are also associated with pulmonary embolism and stroke, which could also \\"kill somebody very suddenly.\\"      Scalia's death, he said, was unexpected, \\"but it sounds like it wasn't suspicious.\\"      The justice's many ailments, taken together, were \\"quite dangerous,\\" said Dr. David Zich, a physician of internal and emergency medicine at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.      Zich said he would advise a patient with those conditions who was still smoking to stop smoking first and then lose weight.      \\"Those are the main two things someone in his position can do himself,\\" Zich said. \\"The rest falls on the physician to medically manage blood pressure and make sure their blood sugar levels are controlled well.\\"      Zich said he would also want such a patient to use a continuous positive airway pressure machine, or CPAP, at night for sleep apnea \\"to make sure the heart and body aren't stressed while sleeping.\\"      A breathing apparatus was found on the night stand next to Scalia's bed when his body was found, but he was not hooked up to it and it was not turned on when he died, according to a Presidio County Sheriff's Office incident report obtained late Tuesday by The Washington Post.      Nothing appeared out of place around Scalia's bed, according to the report. Three pillows were stacked to elevate Scalia's head. A top pillow appeared to have toppled onto his eyes and forehead but didn't appear positioned to impede his breathing, the report stated.      His arms were at his side atop the bed covers, which were pulled up to his chin. The bed covers were smooth and creased and showed no sign of a struggle, according to the report.      His suitcase was open and contained neatly folded clothing. On the kitchen counter rested a blue stretch exercise band.      Guevara, who as county judge is the top administrator in the area, previously said she conferred by phone with Sheriff Danny Dominguez and a U.S. marshal before certifying the death. On the day Scalia died, she also conferred with Monahan by phone before determining the cause of death.      Scalia's death \\"was handled in a similar fashion as the cases of other elderly people who have died in Presidio County,\\" Ponton said.      In rural Texas, justices of the peace investigate deaths, among other duties, but the two justices in the region were out of town and unavailable. Guevara was also out of town, more than 60 miles away, but agreed to conduct the death inquiry by phone.      The Supreme Court does not provide regular reports about the justices' health. It is left to each court member to decide how much to make public about medical conditions.      Some justices, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg, have released detailed reports of hospital stays and surgeries. The Supreme Court's press office could find just one release in 29 years pertaining to Scalia's health, a report of surgery in 2003 to repair a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder.      ___      Associated Press writers Carla K. Johnson in Chicago and Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report. |||||","output":"Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's death has been confirmed as due to natural causes, specifically coronary artery disease, obesity, diabetes and other related ailments.

The worst five cities had 730 murders last year, according to the new FBI stats. Flint, Michigan had highest violent crime rate in 2011, while Detroit, Michigan was second. Last year after 20 officers were axed from Flint's police force and Detroit's law enforcement budget was cut by 18 per cent. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Rising Crime Rates in Michigan: Flint and Detroit Rank Highest in 2011 FBI Stats Introduction: The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has released new statistics highlighting the alarming trends in crime rates, particularly murders, in cities across the United States. The findings show that among the worst five cities, a total of 730 murders were reported last year. Notably, Flint and Detroit, both in Michigan, have ranked as the cities with the highest violent crime rates in 2011. Step 1: Discuss the FBI Statistics: The new FBI report paints a grim picture of the murder rates in the United States, with the five worst cities accounting for 730 homicides in a single year. The statistics serve as a stark warning on the severity of the issue and the need for immediate action. Step 2: Highlight Flint's Crime Rate: Flint, Michigan, dubbed as the \\"murder capital\\" of the United States, emerged as the city with the highest violent crime rate in 2011. The drastic increase in crime is not only alarming, but also signals an urgent need for law enforcement authorities to step up their efforts to address this grim situation. Step 3: Discuss Detroit's Ranking: Coming second to Flint, Detroit, Michigan, has also been plagued by a significantly high violent crime rate according to the 2011 FBI report. These statistics prompt an increasing concern for the well-being and safety of the residents in the city. Step 4: Explain the Impact of Budget Cuts on Police Departments: The skyrocketing crime rates in both Flint and Detroit point to a possible correlation with a severe reduction in law enforcement budgets. Last year, Flint witnessed the dismissal of 20 officers from its police force, while Detroit saw its law enforcement budget slashed by 18%. The decreased funding and manpower could have a direct impact on the ability of these cities to respond to, prevent, and investigate violent crimes. Step 5: Emphasize the Need for Solutions and Action: The strikingly high crime rates in Flint and Detroit, along with the budget cuts impacting their respective police departments, highlight the urgent need for action to combat this growing problem. Both cities must prioritize the safety of their residents and work towards finding effective solutions to tackle violent crime. This may involve reevaluating budgets, increasing police presence, and implementing community-based programs that encourage public participation in crime prevention initiatives. Conclusion: The 2011 FBI statistics serve as a sobering reminder of the rampant crime rates in cities like Flint and Detroit in Michigan. It's crucial that both cities and their law enforcement agencies make concerted efforts to protect their residents, invest in public safety, and work together to decrease the prevalence of violent crime in their communities. While the data showcases the enormity of the issue, it also serves as a call to action for all stakeholders to take immediate and decisive steps to address this pressing concern."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Article: Welcome to the world of multitasking -- a place where the measure of a person is how many jobs they can perform at the same time. In fact, if experts are to be believed, multitasking is a disastrous idea. One of the opponents of multitasking is Dr. Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford University. \\"People who multitask frequently are less able to pay attention; they're worse at managing their memory.\\" he said. In his opinion, the loss that we get with multitasking is harmless in some situations, for example, part of doing business in the digital world: but you can't do serious work like writing, thinking or solving an important problem this way. You do worse even as you think you're doing better. All the time the research points to a simple fact: the brain cannot cope. When you stop midway through composing a report to check an email, you force your brain to stop and regroup. It is like pressing the pause button during a movie, meaning the film takes longer to watch. And as for Dr. Nass, the problems extend beyond the brain. Young people who frequently multitask are not as socially and emotionally healthy as those who don't. They just feel more emotionally satisfied and the feeling is so good and they are bound to desire it again. Todd Oppenheimer, a writer said \\"We've become a very short-term society and don't reward people for taking a lot of time on something.\\" He fears we may end up losing the next generation of great thinkers. \\"It's really unfortunate because the long-term challenges of our world -- environmental issues, financial issues -- require people to think wisely about the long-term consequences of what they do. And it's no coincidence that the kind of people who do think long-term don't multitask.\\" Question: According to Dr. Nass, multitasking   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"can be performed using digital tools\\"? A:","output":"No, the answer \\"can be performed using digital tools\\" is not what Dr. Nass has indicated in the article. According to Dr. Nass, multitasking is detrimental for attention and memory management. He acknowledges that multitasking may be harmless in some situations, such as doing business in the digital world, but he strongly warns against multitasking when it comes to serious tasks that require significant concentration like writing, thinking, and problem solving. He goes on to suggest that multitasking forces the brain to pause and regroup, akin to pressing the pause button during a movie. He also expresses concerns about the social and emotional health of young people who frequently multitask. While the digital world may facilitate multitasking, Dr. Nass implies it's not beneficial for our cognitive and emotional well-being, and can actually lower our performance even when we seem to think we're doing better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During Prohibition, Laurel and Hardy are sent to prison for concocting and selling their own home brew. They are put in a cell with \\"Tiger\\" Long, the roughest, toughest and meanest of all inmates. Stan has a loose tooth that causes him to emit a razzberry at the end of every sentence; the inmate interprets this as a coolly defiant attitude and is impressed—nobody else ever stood up to him like that. He and Stan become fast friends. Laurel & Hardy are assigned to attend prison school with James Finlayson being the teacher. The vaudeville routine that follows ends with a spitball meant for somebody else hitting the teacher in the face and the boys wind up in solitary. There is a sustained scene of the bleak cells with the unseen boys conversing through the walls. After a prison break, the boys escape to a cotton plantation, where they hide out undetected, in blackface. The boys sing \\"Lazy Moon\\". When they attempt to repair the warden's car, they are discovered and are sent back to prison. The prison authorities decide to send Laurel to the prison dentist to have the offending tooth pulled, but the dentist is incompetent and the procedure goes awry. Tricked by a prison guard into calling off a hunger strike by being promised a thanksgiving-style feast, they go to the mess hall, only to be served the usual drab fare. Laurel causes a disturbance by protesting the absence of the feast, but is threatened by the guards. Soon after, as guns are being passed around under the tables, Laurel sets off his gun and causes an uproar. They inadvertently break up the prison riot and the grateful warden issues them a pardon. Laurel unintentionally \\"razzes\\" the warden and their exit from the prison has to be a very fast one.","output":"In the article, Stan refers to Stan Laurel, one half of the famous comedy duo Laurel and Hardy.

Question: Information:  - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Waders are birds commonly found along shorelines and mudflats that wade in order to forage for food (such as insects or crustaceans) in the mud or sand. They are called shorebirds in North America (where \\"wader\\" is used to refer to long-legged wading birds such as storks and herons). Waders are members of the order Charadriiformes, which includes gulls, auks and their allies.  - The coursers are a group of birds which together with the pratincoles make up the family Glareolidae. They have long legs, short wings and long pointed bills which curve downwards. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders is that they inhabit deserts and similar arid regions.  - Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long, stout bills. They belong to the family Ciconiidae. They are the only family in the order Ciconiiformes, which was once much larger and held a number of families.  - Glareolidae is a family of birds in the wader suborder Charadri . It contains two distinct groups , the pratincoles and the coursers . The coursers include the atypical Egyptian plover , Pluvianus aegyptius , which has sometimes been placed in its own family . The family contains 17 species in five genera .  - Charadriiformes is a diverse order of small to medium-large birds. It includes about 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most Charadriiformes live near water and eat invertebrates or other small animals; however, some are pelagic (seabirds), some occupy deserts and a few are found in thick forest.  - Mudflats or mud flats, also known as tidal flats, are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by tides or rivers. They are found in sheltered areas such as bays, bayous, lagoons, and estuaries. Mudflats may be viewed geologically as exposed layers of bay mud, resulting from deposition of estuarine silts, clays and marine animal detritus. Most of the sediment within a mudflat is within the intertidal zone, and thus the flat is submerged and exposed approximately twice daily.  - The Egyptian plover (\\"Pluvianus aegyptius\\"), also known as the crocodile bird, is a wader, the only member of the genus \\"Pluvianus\\". Formerly placed in the pratincole and courser family, Glareolidae, it is now regarded as the sole member of its own monotypic family Pluvianidae.  - Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of whose members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes \\"Tomistoma\\", is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes \\"Tomistoma\\", the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.  - The herons are the long-legged freshwater and coastal birds in the family Ardeidae, with 64 recognised species, some of which are referred to as \\"egrets\\" or \\"bitterns\\" rather than herons. Members of the genera \\"Botaurus\\" and \\"Ixobrychus\\" are referred to as \\"bitterns\\", and, together with the zigzag heron or zigzag bittern in the monotypic genus \\"Zebrilus\\", form a monophyletic group within the Ardeidae. Egrets are not a biologically distinct group from the herons, and tend to be named differently because they are mainly white or have decorative plumes. Although egrets have the same build as herons, they tend to be smaller. Herons, by evolutionary adaptation, have long beaks.  - An auk or alcid is a bird of the family Alcidae in the order Charadriiformes. The alcid family includes the murres, guillemots, auklets, puffins, and murrelets.  - The pratincoles or greywaders are a group of birds which together with the coursers and Egyptian plover make up the family Glareolidae. They have short legs, very long pointed wings and long forked tails.  - Gulls, often referred to as seagulls, are seabirds of the family Laridae in the suborder Lari. They are most closely related to the terns (family Sternidae) and only distantly related to auks, skimmers, and more distantly to the waders. Until the 21st century, most gulls were placed in the genus \\"Larus\\", but this arrangement is now known to be polyphyletic, leading to the resurrection of several genera. An older name for gulls is mew, cognate with German \\"Möwe\\", Danish \\"måge\\", Dutch \\"meeuw\\", and French \\"mouette\\"; this term can still be found in certain regional dialects.    What entity does 'glareolidae' has the relation 'parent taxon' with? Answer:","output":"The entity Glareolidae has the relation \\"parent taxon\\" with the order Charadriiformes. Glareolidae is a family of birds within the wader suborder Charadri, which belongs to the diverse order of Charadriiformes. This larger bird order includes around 350 species and contains members in all parts of the world, with most of them living near water and feeding on invertebrates or other small animals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article using the following points: CNN poll of polls finds 63 percent approve of how President Obama handling duties. Obama's approval rating at 64 percent in CNN poll of polls in January. CNN poll of polls is an average of seven national surveys taken over the past week. Article:","output":"Title: CNN Poll of Polls Reveals Continuously High Approval Ratings for President Obama Introduction: Despite leaving office over four years ago, former President Barack Obama still maintains high approval ratings according to a recent CNN poll of polls. The poll, encompassing an average of seven national surveys, reveals that 63 percent of Americans approve of the way the 44th president handled his duties during his tenure. Step 1: Discuss the current approval rating The CNN poll of polls found that 63 percent of Americans approve of President Obama's performance in office. This high approval rating is consistent with the general sentiment of Americans over the years since he left office. Many people still admire his calm and collected demeanor, which was evident throughout his time in the White House. Step 2: Compare the current approval rating with the previous rating In January, the CNN poll of polls placed President Obama's approval rating at an even higher 64 percent. This difference is not significant and still reflects the popularity and satisfaction that many Americans feel towards his handling of presidential duties. It's worth noting that such high ratings are not common among post-presidency assessments. Step 3: Explain the methodology behind the CNN poll of polls The CNN poll of polls is a reliable method to average out the approval ratings, as it takes into account seven national surveys conducted over the past week. This approach minimizes the chances of skewing and ensures that the results are representative of the general public opinion. Step 4: Highlight the factors that contribute to President Obama's high approval ratings There are several factors that continue to contribute to President Obama's high approval ratings even after his tenure has ended. His achievements during his eight years in office, such as the Affordable Care Act, restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba, and signing the Paris Agreement, all play a significant role in keeping the public's admiration for him intact. In addition to his policy achievements, Obama's charismatic personality, public speaking skills, and ability to connect with people play a considerable part in sustaining his approval ratings. Conclusion: In conclusion, the CNN poll of polls offers a comprehensive snapshot of the lasting approval President Obama continues to hold amongst the American public. His consistently high approval ratings can be attributed to a combination of several factors, including his policy achievements, leadership style, and overall demeanor. As a result, the 44th president serves as a benchmark for future presidents and stands as a symbol of a successful presidency."},{"instruction":"Given the question: \\"Bilocation (film)\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room!

For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.  I am facing a new situation today: Robert was watching the local news when he saw a report about a wildfire. The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Lifelong Democrat Jackie Bland is doing something she never thought she'd do: Urge people to vote for a Republican. Bland supports Thad Cochran, a six-term Mississippi senator who's trying to fend off a fierce tea party challenge to his seat from Chris McDaniel as voting got underway in Tuesday's primary runoff. Two weeks ago, Bland helped put up 5,000 pro-Cochran posters in black communities and talk to people about his record. \\"We wanted to raise the awareness to African-Americans that we do have a stake in this runoff election,\\" she said. She pointed to Cochran's efforts to secure federal funds for jobs, Head Start programs and health centers relied upon by African-Americans in the state. \\"We don't want to move backwards,\\" she said. Bland's efforts reflect the high stakes locally and nationally in the Cochran-McDaniel showdown and also illustrate the unscripted political realities of particular states that play out on Election Day. In this case, it's apparent that Cochran needs Democrats to keep his job, and some Democrats heed the fact that Democratic Senate nominee Travis Childers likely won't win in November, so they turn out for a Republican. In Mississippi, neither candidate secured 50% of the vote in the GOP primary this month, requiring a runoff election. And both sides over the past few weeks have relentlessly pursued get-out-the-vote efforts. Unheralded candidate believes he played spoiler in Cochran race. Mississippi law allows anyone to vote in the runoff, meaning Democrats can go to the polls so long as they didn't vote in the Democratic primary and they don't plan to support their party candidate in the general election. The question is whether Cochran can shore up enough support to beat back the tea party wave against him. McDaniel got about 1,400 more votes than Cochran in the primary, and national conservative groups have actively rallied around the challenger. Mississippi primary spending spree pushes advertisers off the air. Cochran is pushing his message that his experience makes him more influential in Congress, and his ties on Capitol Hill will better serve Mississippi if he's reelected. McDaniel and allies, however, say Cochran has been in office long enough, and his tenure only breathes more life to the status quo. For his part, McDaniel vows to bring change to the nation's capital and shake things up on Capitol Hill. \\"The people of this country are finally waking up again and recognizing that Washington's been broken for a long time,\\" McDaniel said Monday, referring to tea party victories in recent years. \\"All the sudden you see a great awakening among all the people, particularly those who are very dissatisfied with the direction our country is going.\\" Courting the African-American vote. Mississippi Conservatives, a super PAC founded by former Gov. Haley Barbour and his nephew, Henry, has taken the lead in courting votes from Democrats, especially in the African-American community. Cochran's allies are arguing the case that he has long been there for the voting bloc and would better represent their interests than McDaniel. The issue is so complicated that even Bland can hardly stomach what she's doing. She attended an event Monday featuring Republican Sen. John McCain, who called on voters to keep Cochran in Washington but also spent much of his speech blasting President Barack Obama. Bland, a supporter of the President, got up and left. Cochran acknowledged Monday he would likely benefit if a wide range of voters turn out for the runoff. \\"I've always reached out and benefited from support from the black community,\\" he said. \\"My responsibility as a United States senator has been to represent the people of the state of Mississippi, not just one party or one race or a select group of friends.\\" But another Mississippi political veteran labeled the vote courting a risky move. \\"It might get him some votes, but it might lose him some votes,\\" said former Republican Sen. Trent Lott. The ex-Senate majority leader not only served with Cochran for many years, but the two were competitors for the leadership position in 1996. Lott now describes Cochran as \\"a good friend\\" and said he's \\"very nervous\\" about the runoff.  It will be \\"difficult for Thad to overcome the momentum\\" by McDaniel, he predicted. Vote underway. Conservative groups are working with Christian Adams, a former Justice Department official, to train volunteers to monitor poll workers and make sure they check to see whether Democrats have already voted in their primary. Some critics question whether the effort might lead to voter intimidation. The Mississippi NAACP dispatched about 250 volunteers to watch poll stations and look for any signs of interference. They're supposed to call the state office if anyone is turned away, but enforcing the crossover primary rule may be hard to enforce. Wayne McDaniels, president the NAACP's Jackson City Branch, said the biggest concern is polling stations in rural areas. \\"There won't be much coverage as far as the news media out there, so those are the pockets where someone might figure they can get away with certain things,\\" he said. McDaniels said the state office hadn't yet receive any calls or suspicious reports from any of the volunteers in the field. CNN saw three people turned away by poll workers in Jackson because they voted in the Democratic primary. Monitoring crossover voters. Adams is overseeing the \\"election integrity project\\" for the conservative groups FreedomWorks, Tea Party Patriots and Senate Conservatives Fund, said Monday in a phone interview that volunteers won't be instructed to talk to voters or poll workers, but only monitor the process at polling stations across the state. \\"These are not negotiators,\\" he told CNN, stressing that they're \\"not activists urging people\\" to vote one way or the other. He said the volunteers will \\"observe what's going on and how to memorialize the events of the day in an observer report,\\" which will be reviewed by lawyers. But he refused to elaborate on who the lawyers are and who they work for. He also declined to be more specific about where exactly the volunteers would be working, saying only that they will be stationed at polling locations \\"across the state.\\"  Pressed on why he was providing few details about an effort that seeks transparency and honesty in an election process, Adams didn't give an answer. McDaniel, who chairs the elections committee in the state Senate, said Monday he approves of the monitoring effort and doubts intimidation will become an issue. \\"The issue is to make sure we have a fair process,\\" he said. He argued that a high Democratic turnout for Cochran would reveal the senator's true colors. \\"I'm not concerned about them being African-American. I'm concerned about them being liberal,\\" he told CNN. \\"That's always been my concern. If Senator Cochran is going to court liberal Democrats to save his seat, that's a good indication that he's abandoned conservatism in Mississippi.\\" Learning from last time. Since Cochran failed to defeat McDaniel in the primary, the senator and his campaign have been more aggressive about their ground game. Sources familiar with Cochran's campaign strategy say they hope that a lot of Republicans who stayed home during the primary, thinking Cochran would be fine, will show up at the polls. The senator has had a more active schedule for the runoff and his overall operation is more finely tuned. On Monday, he campaigned with McCain, who reiterated the pitch that an experienced senator is more beneficial for a state. McDaniel doubled down on his attack line against Cochran, saying his partnership with McCain further proves how out of touch the senator is with conservatives. Former Sen. Lott has also helped out Cochran by cutting an ad for his former colleague. He said he didn't do much for Cochran in the  primary because \\"I think they didn't think they needed me.\\" But the runoff's been different. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also pitched in for Cochran and produced an ad featuring retired NFL star Brett Favre, a Mississippi native. But Cochran isn't the only one with a celebrity endorsement. Longtime game show host Chuck Woolery headlined a bus tour organized by the Tea Party Express. While Cochran has tried to make the case that his near-four decades in the Senate brings wisdom and power, he's fighting an uphill battle against a younger politician and former talk radio host who paints himself as the candidate more principled and eager to help lead a conservative movement in the Senate. Jeremiah Boddy, 20, a student at the University of Southern Mississippi and a McDaniel supporter, showed up to a Cochran event Monday. \\"I feel like it's the same rhetoric, just washed and put in different clothes,\\" he told CNN. \\"I mean he has no charisma, and as far as I'm concerned, he couldn't sell you a brand new car, even if it was free.\\" Write highlights for this article.","output":"This article is about a lady named Jackie Bland who is supporting a Republican candidate named Thad Cochran.

Make this proper case","output":"Backgammon has always been a popular game for players in most parts of the world, and players have been gambling on the outcome of games for ages. This ancient board game, dating back almost 5,000 years, is believed to have originated in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) and then spread to Egypt, Persia, Rome, and beyond. It's been a beloved pastime throughout history, enjoyed by players from every societal stratum and across cultures. By the Middle Ages, backgammon had made its way to Europe, where it was promptly banned by the Church, only to gain immense popularity following this period. Backgammon is simple in concept yet offers depth and complexity that have captivated millions. Each player has a collection of 15 \\"checkers\\" which move on a board, according to the roll of two dice. The objective is to be the first to \\"bear off,\\" or remove all your checkers from the board, while hindering your opponent's progress at the same time. There's a balance between strategy and luck, as players plan their moves strategically, yet are also governed by the roll of the dice. Considering the element of chance involved with the dice, it's no surprise that gambling has long been associated with backgammon. During the game, players can choose to 'double' the stakes with the use of a 'doubling cube', taking the game's excitement to new heights. This introduces an additional level of strategy as players need to decide whether or not the game is favorable enough to accept a double or if it is time to concede.  Moreover, professional backgammon tournaments around the world often have substantial cash prizes, adding yet another gambling dimension to this already thrilling game. These tournaments test the skills and strategies of players in a highly competitive environment, while also fueling the gambling aspect of the game. In the modern era, backgammon maintains its popularity through online gaming platforms. These platforms have made it easier for fans around the world to not only play the game but also to bet on it. Many online platforms offer opportunities for betting similar to that in a live backgammon match. They have rekindled interest in this ancient game, attracting a new generation of players eager to test their skills and try their luck.  In conclusion, backgammon is deeply rooted in our global culture. Despite its age, it continues to intrigue and engage players worldwide and remains a popular choice for those who enjoy games with a balance of luck and strategy. Its association with gambling persists and has even evolved to fit the online sphere. Whether for fun, friendly competition, or the thrill of gambling, backgammon continues to endure as a beloved game across the globe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In one way of thinking, failure is part of life. In another way, failure may be a way towards success. The \\"spider-story\\" is often told. Robert Bruce, leader of the Scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a cave from the English. He watched a spider making a web . The spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock. He tried six times. On the seventh time he made it and went on to make his web. Bruce is said to have been encouraged by this and to have gone on to defeat the English. Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one. Once he was asked why he kept on trying to make a new type of battery when he had failed so often, he replied, \\"Failure? I have no failure. Now I know 50,000 ways it won't work.\\" So what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were conditions right? Were you in top form yourself? What can you change so things will go right next time? Second, is the goal you're trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be. Think about this question, \\"If I do succeed in this, where will it get me?\\" This may help you prevent failure in things you shouldn't be doing anyway. The third thing to keep in mind about failure is that it's a part of life. Learn to \\"live with yourself\\" even though you may have failed. Question: Even if we have failed we should   _  .

Here's the math problem we have: 162 - 6631 = -631 * i + 13723 First, let's simplify the left side of the equation. We need to subtract 6631 from 162. 162 - 6631 = -6469 Now our equation looks like this: -6469 = -631 * i + 13723 Next, let's move the 13723 from the right side to the left side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 13723 from both sides: -6469 - 13723 = -631 * i This simplifies to: -20192 = -631 * i Now we just need to find the value of 'i'. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -631: -20192 / -631 = i This gives us: 32 = i So the answer to the math problem is: i = 32.

Summarize this article: The warning - by campaigners - comes after inspectors revealed one in four care homes had been found to be failing on safety. For nursing homes, it was even worse - more than one in three. So how do you find the right one? For many, navigating a way around the care system can be incredibly difficult. The first thing you need to do is to find out whether you - or the person on whose behalf you are looking - can get help towards the costs. The local council is in charge of deciding this. You are entitled to ask them for an assessment. Only those with modest means - assets of below £23,250 - are given any help. And even if you are, you may find yourself paying a top-up fee to get the care home of your choice if it costs more than your council is willing to pay. You obviously have more choice if you have to pay for yourself. But the price can be much higher - the average cost of a care home for a self-funder is £618 a week, compared with £486 paid for by councils. You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating. average amount of care provided per week, by your council average paid per hour by your council, 2014-15 average paid per hour in your region if you pay for your own care, 2016 You live in a care home that provides round-the-clock support with everyday tasks. TBC pay for their own care You live in a care home which provides round-the-clock support for everyday tasks and nursing care. Depending on your medical needs, the NHS may contribute to your costs. TBC pay for their own care Savings, investments and income are assessed, along with the value of your home - unless you or a close relative live there. The move is permanent. Once in a care home, you are unlikely to be coming home. So experts suggest that people explore all the avenues before they take the plunge. There are a variety of options. High-intensity care in your own home for daily tasks such as washing, dressing and eating can avoid the need to move into a care home. Other avenues, which are growing in popularity, include getting live-in carers. There are about 150 shared-lives schemes in the country, two-thirds of which are run by councils. Then there are retirement villages where residents usually buy an apartment on the site, although in some schemes they can part-buy or even rent the property. People can pay for care and support services, which are on-site, as and when they need them. The properties on them have been designed to keep the individual living independently as long as possible and so can be kitted out with alarms, fall sensors and easily accessible showers. Such complexes are popular in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, but have yet to completely take off in the UK. There are fewer than 30,000 units in the UK. There are also many different types of sheltered-housing schemes. These have wardens, communal areas and, sometimes, run social events for residents. For those needing more support, extra-care sheltered housing may be available, where residents can have personal care and meals provided. If you do decide to move into a home, there are two choices - a residential care home or nursing home. Latest figures show there are 220,000 nursing home beds, compared with nearly 240,000 care home ones. If you have a medical condition that requires a lot of care, a nursing home could be for you and you may find you are entitled to some NHS funding to cover the costs. Residential care homes do not have to employ nurses, although that does not mean there will be no input from health staff. Community nurses and GPs should both provide support to residents as they would to anyone in their own homes. But it may be worth asking what support there is available. A diagnosis of dementia does not necessarily mean you will get NHS funding, so you might want to check what help can be provided and what training there is for staff for such conditions. It may also be worth considering that you may need nursing support as you get older - some care homes will also have wings with nursing beds. And end-of-life care should also be a consideration - most people die within two years of moving into a home and good palliative care can avoid the need for potentially distressing trips back-and-forth to hospital. One person who has found a great care home is Colin Coulson. He had to move his wife, Dot, 73, into a care home when her dementia worsened. Mr Coulson had been looking after her at home in Kent for five years before she needed to move into residential care. The first home she moved to was not good. \\"It was understaffed, and it just wasn't right for Dot,\\" he says. \\"She had been in hospital, and it was all a bit of a rush to be honest.\\" He quickly decided to look for another - and, with more time, found Brambling House in Dover, which, he says, was \\"lovely, friendly and welcoming\\" from the start. \\"I looked around on the internet. I read the inspection reports and looked at what support they could provide. \\"I then went to visit the home. When we first arrived, we received a lovely, friendly welcome, as if they had known us for years. The other residents looked very happy and content, and the home is laid out to look and feel so homely. \\"My wife was, of course, totally disorientated, but before we left, she had already been given a drink and a bowl of fruit salad. \\"Everywhere we went in the home it was clean and tidy, and the staff we met were polite and made us very welcome. \\"We were told by Sue, the manager, that their home was our home. \\"Now five weeks on, we were completely right. If I had any advice for others I would say, 'Do a bit of research, visit the place and then trust your gut feeling.'\\" A vital source of information is the library inspection reports produced by the Care Quality Commission. These - as well as a guide to which homes are close to you - can be found here. Each provides an overall rating and individual grades for safety, leadership, care, effectiveness and responsiveness. Andrea Sutcliffe, chief inspector of care homes, urges people to check them. \\"I ask my staff, when they are inspecting them, to apply the 'Mum test' - are they good enough for their mum or anyone they loved? \\"That has guided our approach to inspections, and so the reports should provided a clear picture about the performance of the care.\\" There are other sources of information too. A browse of the internet will bring up a number of different guides to care homes that can also provide a picture of what to expect. Nothing, of course, actually beats seeing the care home for yourself. Caroline Abraham, of Age UK, says: \\"Really take your time. Have a good walk around, talk to staff, families and managers. They will all provide you with a real insight into what it is like.\\" To help you, Age UK has produced a checklist of things to ask. Some of the suggested questions are: \\"Don't be afraid to ask awkward questions either - the answers will reveal a lot about the home,\\" says Ms Abrahams. Summary:","output":"Campaigners have warned that finding safe care homes for the elderly is becoming increasingly difficult as one in four care facilities has been reported as failing on safety. For nursing homes, the situation is even worse, with more than one in three found to be failing on safety. Navigating the care system can be complex, with multiple routes available (including care at home, retirement villages, sheltered-housing schemes, and extra-care sheltered housing) depending on individual requirements and means. For those requiring care homes, two primary options are available: residential care home and nursing home. Crucial information in the selection process includes inspection reports from the Care Quality Commission, which can provide details on the overall rating of homes and grades for safety, leadership, care, effectiveness, and responsiveness. Personal visits to the care homes and conversations with staff, families, and managers can also provide valuable insights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Does the sentence \\"The most powerful constitutional power was imperium.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What is considered to be the most authoritative constitutional power?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"The most powerful constitutional power was imperium.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"What is considered to be the most authoritative constitutional power?\\" However, it is essential to understand the context and background behind 'imperium' to fully appreciate why it was the most authoritative constitutional power.  Imperium, in ancient Rome, referred to the supreme executive authority held by certain high-ranking magistrates or officials, which included the power to command armies, administer provinces, and enforce laws. The concept of imperium emerged as a vital and authoritative constitutional power in Roman politics, symbolizing the undeniable strength and control held by the individual wielding it. Originally, imperium was bestowed upon consuls and praetors, the highest-ranking officials in the Roman Republic. Later, during the Roman Empire, the emperor also possessed imperium. The individuals holding this power had great authority and responsibility, including leading the military during warfare, maintaining the peace within provinces, and executing capital punishments when required. Imperium also conferred upon its holder the rights to celebrating a triumph after a successful military campaign and levying troops for wars. Wielding imperium allowed the ruler to create a sense of respect, obedience, and loyalty among the citizens and other officials. Furthermore, this power was not absolute or unrestricted, as overstepping its boundaries or using it for unjust purposes could lead to consequences imposed by the Senate. Various symbols signified imperium, including the fasces, a bundle of wooden rods surrounding an axe that represented strength through unity. The lictors, ceremonial bodyguards, would carry the fasces before a magistrate as a symbol of their authority. Additionally, holders of imperium were granted specific privileges, such as wearing the toga praetexta (a toga with a purple border) and having a curule chair, a kind of ornate folding chair designed for high-ranking individuals. While imperium was an authoritative power, checks and balances existed to prevent its excessive use or abuse. For example, a magistrate possessing imperium could not enter the city of Rome unless they formally relinquished this power, as the city was considered a sacred space where the power to enforce laws was restricted. Additionally, some instances existed in which the imperium of one magistrate could be subjected to the authority of another, known as 'imperium maius,' ensuring cooperation and the balance of power. In conclusion, the statement \\"The most powerful constitutional power was imperium\\" does indeed provide a valid answer to the question about the most authoritative constitutional power. It mainly refers to the context of ancient Rome, where high-ranking officials held imperium, granting them significant authority and responsibility. However, this power was regulated through various checks and balances, ensuring that harmony, stability, and transparency were maintained throughout the political hierarchy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In March 1977, when Simon was still in high school, Simon's father was one of a group of over 140 people held hostage (and later released) in Washington, D.C. by former national secretary of the Nation of Islam Hamaas Abdul Khaalis in the Hanafi Siege. Simon was raised in a Jewish family with roots that originated in Eastern Europe and Hungary (his maternal grandfather had changed his surname from \\"Leibowitz\\" to \\"Ligeti\\"). He has a brother, Gary Simon, and a sister, Linda Evans, who died in 1990. The publishers of Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets were eager for a screen adaptation and submitted it to numerous directors but there was little interest. Simon suggested that they send the book to Baltimore native and film director Barry Levinson. Levinson's assistant Gail Mutrux enjoyed the book and both she and Levinson became attached as producers. The project became the award-winning TV series Homicide: Life on the Street (1993-1999), on which Simon worked as a writer and producer.  Simon was asked by Mutrux to write the show's pilot episode but declined, feeling he did not have the necessary expertise. He collaborated with his old college friend David Mills to write the season two premiere \\"Bop Gun\\". The episode was based on a story by executive producer Tom Fontana and featured Robin Williams in a guest starring role that garnered the actor an Emmy nomination. Simon and Mills won the WGA Award for Best Writing in a Drama for the episode. Simon also received Austin Film Festival's Outstanding Television Writer Award in 2010.  Simon left his job with the Baltimore Sun in 1995 to work full-time on Homicide: Life on the Street during the production of the show's fourth season. Simon wrote the teleplay for the season four episodes \\"Justice: Part 2\\" and \\"Scene of the Crime\\" (with Anya Epstein). For season five he was the show's story editor and continued to contribute teleplays writing the episodes \\"Bad Medicine\\" and \\"Wu's on First?\\" (again with Epstein). He was credited as a producer on the show's sixth and seventh seasons. He wrote the teleplays for parts two and three of the sixth season premiere \\"Blood Ties\\" (the latter marking his third collaboration with Epstein) and provided the story for the later sixth season episodes \\"Full Court Press\\" and \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" (with James Yoshimura). He provided the story for the seventh season episodes \\"Shades of Gray\\" (with Julie Martin), \\"The Same Coin\\" (again with Yoshimura) and \\"Self Defense\\" (with Eric Overmyer). Simon wrote the story and teleplay for the seventh season episodes \\"The Twenty Percent Solution\\" and \\"Sideshow: Part 2\\". Simon, Martin and teleplay writer T. J.

However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies.

Weslake, who was laid off from his job, is working in a low-paying position at Garvey's pawn shop. Weslake has one friend nicknamed 'Turtle' who's homeless and is seen throughout the whole film searching for something to eat. One day, Dillard, who is an amateur musician, and Ramon, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who lives with his sister Maria, come to Garvey's shop. The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it's not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back. Their conversation is heard by a 'Boardwalk', a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again.

When a stiff turns up with pneumonic plague (a variant of bubonic plague), U.S. Public Health Service official Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) immediately quarantines everyone whom he knows was near the body. Unfortunately, the stiff got that way by being murdered, and there's a good chance that the murderer will start spreading the plague, leading to an epidemic. Enter Police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who is enlisted to track down the murderer as soon as possible and avert a possible national disaster. While Panic in the Streets is a quality film, it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling (my reason for bringing the score down to an eight). It wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster, police procedural, thriller and even romance. This is not director Elia Kazan's best work, but saying that is a bit disingenuous. Kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955), after all. This film predates those, but Kazan has said that he was already \\"untethered\\" by the studio. Taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl. The film is set in New Orleans, a city where Kazan \\"used to wander around . . . night and day so I knew it well\\". He wanted to exploit the environment. \\"It's so terrific and colorful. I wanted boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz joints--all of New Orleans\\". Kazan handles each genre of Panic in the Streets well, but they could be connected better. The film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods. The sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked. Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, \\"Quarantine\\" and \\"Some Like 'Em Cold\\". The gangster material, which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film, is probably the highlight. Not surprisingly, Kazan has said that he believes the villains are \\"more colorful--I never had much affection for the good guys anyway. I don't like puritans\\". A close second is the only material that approaches the \\"panic\\" of the title--the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed, inoculate them and contain the disease. While there is plenty of suspense during these two \\"moods\\", much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama, with pacing more typical of that genre. The dialogue throughout is excellent. The stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced. It is intelligent, delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character. Conflict isn't created by \\"dumb\\" decisions but smart moves; events and characters' actions are more like a chess game. When unusual stances are taken, such as Reed withholding the plague from the newspapers, he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions, which other characters argue over. In light of this, it's interesting that Kazan believed that \\"propriety, religion, ethics and the middle class are all murdering us\\". That idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm, or allowances away from it, made by the protagonists. For example, head gangster Blackie (Jack Palance in his first film role) is offered a \\"Get Out of Jail Free\\" card if he'll cooperate with combating the plague. The technical aspects of the film are fine, if nothing exceptional, but the real reasons to watch are the performances, the intriguing scenario and the well-written dialogue. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mixed, with a slight lean towards positive.

The reviewer's overall score for the film is 8 out of 10, indicating a generally positive view but with some reservations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

AJ A:","output":"Title: \\"Whispers of the Heart\\" Genre: Romantic Drama Synopsis: Claire Thompson, a talented young artist trying to find her place in the world, has always been in love with AJ Simmons, her childhood best friend and the boy next door. As they both start college and venture into adulthood, their bond is tested as they embark on different paths in life. Conflicting emotions, ambitions, and the revelation of a family secret threatens their affection and challenges their future. Act One: Growing up in the idyllic, picturesque town of Fairfield, Claire and AJ had spent most of their lives as inseparable friends. Encouraged by her supportive and loving parents, Claire pursued her passion for painting and writing, while AJ followed his dreams of becoming a musician. While they shared many interests, their polar opposite personalities both complemented and clashed with each other. Claire was an introvert, with a penchant for expressing her emotions through art. AJ, though caring and sensitive, wore his heart on his sleeve and inspired others through his voice and melodies. As their senior year of high school came to an end, the reality of potentially being separated by long distances and conflicting schedules started to sink in. Although Claire had been romantically attracted to AJ since they were teenagers, she could never find it within herself to express her feelings. AJ, on the other hand, remained blissfully unaware of her affections, as he was preoccupied with an on-again, off-again relationship with another high school classmate, Stephanie. Act Two: The tension between Claire and AJ begins to grow as they enter college. While Claire attends a prestigious art school in New York City, AJ enrolls in a renowned music program in Los Angeles. They promise to stay in touch and support each other's dreams, but the challenges of distance and their new environments strain their friendship. Claire's roommate, Emily, who instantly notices Claire's feelings for AJ, becomes her confidante and helps her navigate the complexities of love and friendship. With occasional visits and video calls keeping them connected, Claire starts to find new friends and flourish in her art career, but cannot let go of her love for AJ. Meanwhile, AJ starts gaining recognition as an up-and-coming musician, while his relationship with Stephanie finally ends as she cheats on him. Devastated, AJ finds solace in Claire’s calming words and becomes more aware of the bond they share. Act Three: Claire returns to Fairfield during winter break, where she and AJ rekindle their friendship and grow even closer. Just as Claire finally musters the courage to confess her feelings to him, she stumbles upon a secret that her mother, Grace, had kept hidden for years. Claire learns that AJ is, in fact, her half-brother, a child born from a secret affair between Grace and AJ’s dad, Thomas. Struggling to come to terms with this revelation, Claire's world implodes, but she decides to keep the secret from AJ to protect their families and their friendship. Torn between her love for AJ and the harrowing discovery, Claire starts seeing a therapist and leans on Emily for support. Act Four: As truth has a way of surfacing, the family secret ultimately comes to light, and it shatters the harmony of their lives, leaving both Claire and AJ feeling betrayed and heartbroken. The turmoil of emotions forces them to confront the reality of their newfound relationship and their true feelings for each other. Slowly coming to terms with the painful truth, Claire and AJ, with the help of their friends and family, learn to navigate their new reality. Although the romantic aspect of their love remains forbidden, they find solace in the fact that their connection has only grown stronger. They continue to support each other in their respective careers, believing that their unbreakable bond, despite the odds, whispers of the heart that refuses to be silenced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Six nights a week, The Social Club in downtown Nashville holds parties for couples and singles to dance, flirt and mingle. Sometimes they take the festivities upstairs — to the private beds, the love swings, the group play areas, the “Sybian” room or the dungeon. Yes, people have sex there. “Remember, we are all strangers until we meet!” is a motto at this private swingers group founded in 1980 for consenting adults to explore their sexual fantasies with and around each other. The swingers recently decided they were ready to move to the suburbs. The suburbs do not appear ready for the swingers. When the club purchased a building next to a Christian school, residents protested and threw zoning problems in its way. So the swingers have come up with a new plan to short-circuit the zoning static around their relocation: Their new club, they say, is a church — a church for swingers to meet, to mingle and to engage in the regular practice of their faith. If the city accuses them of running a sham church, the club’s longtime lawyer Larry Roberts says that the Constitution is on their side. Is it? And what defines a “religion,” anyway? The answer to that question is complicated — so complicated, it’s occupied U.S. courts for roughly two centuries now. “They can sue us and say they want an injunction to stop us from operating, and we can say we have some tenets of the church sort of like the Ten Commandments,” Roberts said over the phone. He listed a few. “Do not steal. Do not lie. Do not cheat. Do not commit any act that will be harmful to others. Do not commit adultery without the knowledge and consent of your spouse.” “That one’s a little bit different,” Roberts admitted. How the swingers sex club became a church For years, the swingers have been meeting at a nondescript brick building less than a mile south of Music City Center, in an area that once teemed with adult bookstores and gentleman’s clubs hidden in plain sight. Now the neighborhood is gentrifying quickly. Last fall, the group sold their complex for 1.3 million, more than double what they purchased it for in 1998. They bought an abandoned medical office in a quiet neighborhood north of Nashville called Madison. The 22,000-square-foot space, with private exam rooms that could easily become play rooms, was near perfect — except that it happened to sit between two churches and a posh private Christian academy. “It’s the biggest bunch of bigots that I would into run into except maybe at a Klu Klux Klan meeting,” Roberts said. “When my clients first began considering this, I said, ‘With this location, you’re going to create a firestorm of controversy.’ ” They did. Karen Bennett, who represents this neighborhood on the legislative council for Nashville and Davidson County, said that hundreds of parents — more than 400 by her count — came to each of the public hearings a few months ago. “Madison is a really good, solid, suburban community in Nashville, very family-based,” Bennett said. ”Most people feel like this would be a black eye to have this adult club. It’s not what they want for their community.” Bennett herself graduated from Goodpasture Christian School, which is across the street from the new club building. She’s concerned about having a club so close to a school. Think of the children, she says. “[The swingers] seem to think that they would be quiet neighbors, and I don’t think that’s really the case,” she said. “Kids ask questions and they want to know what is going on.” [This reality show about married swingers is crazy, but not for the reason you think] The neighbors demanded that something be done. “We’re going to pursue that at the highest level legally,” Goodpasture’s president told a local news broadcast in January. “We’re going to pursue it politically. Our goal is for them to never open their doors at 520 Lentz.” That meant that the townspeople were going to change the rules. When the swingers bought the old medical office, they had made sure that it was legal to hold events there. But Bennett soon introduced a new ordinance amending the zoning laws in Nashville and Davidson County. The swingers’ new property would no longer be able to host private clubs of any kind. The Metro Council passed that measure in late March. Soon after, Tennessee’s state legislature also unanimously approved a new law prohibiting private clubs where people can watch or have sex from operating within 1,000 feet of a school. It goes without saying that religious values animate a good deal of the public discourse in Tennessee, where cities are not allowed to have laws protecting gay people from discrimination, and where lawmakers this year sought to make the Bible the state book. Religious institutions are so powerful and protected in America, reasoned the swingers’ lawyer, that if the club couldn’t beat them — well, perhaps it would join them. “What is religion to you may not be to someone else; and what is religion to someone else may not be to you,” Roberts said. According to the club’s new renovation plans, the game room will become the fellowship hall. The north dungeon will be the choir room. The south dungeon will be the handbell room. There won’t be any sex at this church, Roberts said, but people could gather here, and take the party off-premises. “It may not be what they call a ‘full service’ club, but I think it will fulfill the function,” he said. Once the operation is up and running, the city might send inspectors to verify that it is acting as a church. It might issue a warrant asking the courts to adjudicate. (In practice, Nashville zoning administrator Bill Herbert said he’s never heard of a case involving “un-traditional types of churches.”) Roberts said he was the one who counseled the swingers to become a church. He believed that they needed the strong protections and freedoms that the government affords to religious groups. “It’s something that the government can’t control,” he said. “After all, isn’t that the reason America was established, or one of them?” A judge can’t divine which gods are real or false … The First Amendment says that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” But the Constitution is completely silent on the more fundamental question of what religion actually is. And centuries of legal debate haven’t resolved matters much. “Courts struggle with this,” said Alan Brownstein, a law professor at UC Davis. “We do not have an accepted working definition of religion in American legal jurisprudence.” It’s paradoxical, almost. How can a nation so concerned with religious freedom not agree on what constitutes a religion? How can we attach so many protections and privileges to something so legally amorphous? But religious liberty also implies religious diversity, and religious tolerance. The nation, indeed, was founded in part by refugees of a minority sect. In that spirit, the courts have been incredibly reluctant to rule on whether someone’s religion or religious beliefs are the real deal. “We’re worried that if we define religion too narrowly, we’ll end up excluding some belief systems that do deserve to be recognized,” Brownstein said. “It’s very hard to come up with a good definition of religion that includes everything we want to be covered and only excludes what we thinks should be excluded.” On occasions when courts have been forced to render judgement, they often defer to what a person says their religious beliefs are, even if those beliefs are out of the mainstream or idiosyncratic. “[R]eligious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection,” Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger famously wrote in the majority opinion for Thomas v. Review Board in 1981. [Eugene Volokh explains how the Hobby Lobby decision relied on Thomas v. Review Board] Eddie Thomas was a metal worker and a devout Jehovah’s Witness. In a job application for the Blaw-Knox Foundry and Machinery Co., he listed his hobbies as “Bible study” and “Bible reading.” A year after he joined, the company moved him to a position making tank turrets. Thomas felt this was against his religion. He quit and fought the state of Indiana for unemployment benefits. Thomas’s case, which ended up at the Supreme Court, hinged on whether his beliefs about pacifism were truly religious in nature. Thomas had struggled to define some of the moral principles of his religion. He admitted in court that his friend, also a Jehovah’s Witness, disagreed that their religion prohibited his employment in the tank turret department. In light of these contradictions, the lower court argued that Thomas’s views were a “personal philosophical choice,” lacking sufficient religious character. The Supreme Court brushed aside those concerns. “Courts are not arbiters of scriptural interpretation,” Burger wrote, setting a precedent that the legal system would gingerly handle questions of religious validity. So, for instance, the courts have recognized Wiccan covens (there is even one in Memphis); they have ruled in favor of a Santeria group that wanted to sacrifice animals. In the course of its work, the Internal Revenue Service also has to determine whether religions are valid or not. The IRS gives tax exemptions to churches in part because churches tend to serve the public good through education and charity work. To evaluate a church, it considers a range of criteria: whether the church has a creed, religious services, ordained ministers, religious literature and so forth. But these are just guidelines, and religious groups will sue if they think they were unfairly snubbed. The Church of Scientology, for instance, battled the IRS for years to gain tax-exempt status. In one famous lawsuit, the Ninth Circuit ruled that Scientology did not deserve tax breaks because it seemed to be organized like a business funneling profits to its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This violated an IRS rule that says nonprofits need to have some kind of charitable or public service purpose. That case avoided the much tougher question of whether Scientology was actually a religion — a question that the courts feel ill-equipped to answer. In the end, the matter was not decided in court anyway. As the famous story goes, Scientologists pressured the IRS to the point that it finally changed its mind. … but can the courts peer into your soul? And yet, it is also clearly unreasonable for anyone to be able to create a religion or claim newfound religious beliefs just to get special treatment. While courts tend to avoid rendering judgment on anyone’s religion, they are more comfortable ruling on whether someone holds their religious beliefs sincerely. This is the way that many religion-of-convenience lawsuits are decided, explains James Oleske, a law professor at Lewis and Clark. “In general, courts are very reluctant to question the validity of religious beliefs,” he said. “But they do ask if there really is a good-faith, religious belief that exists — that this isn’t a sham in order for people to get immunity for their secular practices.” [Supreme Court rules in favor of Arkansas Muslim inmate’s request to grow beard] There are several examples of courts denying people religious privileges by calling into question whether they actually believe what they say they believe. For instance, Oleske points to a 2010 New Mexico case involving a couple that created a church around sacrament of marijuana. Citing these religious beliefs, in conjunction with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Danuel and Mary Quaintance attempted to defend against criminal marijuana charges. The Tenth Circuit found theirs to be a flimsy argument. People testified that the Quaintances talked about their marijuana operation as a “business” not as a church. “[T]he record contains additional, overwhelming contrary evidence that the Quaintances were running a commercial marijuana business with a religious front,” judge Neil Gorsuch wrote in the 2010 decision. At this point, marijuana church arguments are known to be long shots. “We get these fraternities that call us up,” said Eric Rassbach, a lawyer at the Beckett Fund, a religious liberty defense organization. “Some group of guys on a college campus call us up and say: ‘We just invented this new church. Its sacrament is marijuana. Will you defend us?’ ” “We tell them no, sorry guys, you’re not the first to come up with this idea and you’re going to lose,” Rassbach said. (Sometimes, though it is rare, such an argument does win. Oleske notes that in 2013, the Minnesota Court of Appeals allowed a Rastafarian to keep his marijuana pipe because it had religious significance to him. The pipe reminded him to “perform what needs to be performed, which is smoking.”) Some of this may seem bizarre. Judges and juries lack telepathy. How can courts presume to evaluate how deeply someone believes? Who is to say what your intimate relationship to your god is? The process is difficult, Rassbach concedes, but the courts delve into people’s minds all the time, he said. “Courts cannot decide whether a religious belief is true, but they can decide whether it is truly held. That’s a state of mind question, and courts do that business day in, day out.” [How religious freedom laws were praised, then hated, then forgotten, then, finally, resurrected] A murder case, for instance, might depend on proving whether someone had intent to kill. A securities fraud case, Rassbach said, asks whether the defendants intentionally deceived investors. Courts look at evidence to gauge someone’s sincerity. How does someone behave? Do they make effort to adhere to the tenets of their faith? Have they practiced their religion in this way for a long time? How do they talk about their spirituality to their friends and family? And most importantly, might they have some ulterior motive for professing these religious beliefs? These questions sometimes get muddy. In the Hobby Lobby case before the Supreme Court, the justices had to look at the beliefs of the companies’ religious owners, who refused to pay for employee health insurance plans that included contraceptive coverage. That would go against their religion, the owners claimed. No one denied that these bosses were devout people — and yet, did they really believe that paying for this kind of insurance violated their religion? After all, they were not directly funding contraceptives — they were several times removed from the behavior that they found unholy. Did they sincerely believe this would be a stain on their conscience? But the Supreme Court did not treat this as an issue of religious sincerity; this question was treated as an issue of doctrinal interpretation, which is territory that the court treads lightly upon. “[I]t is not for us to say that their religious beliefs are mistaken or insubstantial,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority. “Instead, our ‘narrow function … in this context is to determine’ whether the line drawn reflects ‘an honest conviction,’ … and there is no dispute that it does.” What does this mean for the swingers church? Most of the religious scholars agreed that the swingers church would be in trouble if the city came and sued them for not being a real church. It does not look good that the swingers only started their church in response to being banned from opening their sex club at the same property. Ira “Chip” Lupu, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University, offered a different, non-religious defense. Lupu cited what has become known as the “Sister Wives” case. In 2011, the polygamous family featured on the TLC show “Sister Wives” challenged Utah’s anti-polygamy law after facing criminal charges for cohabitating. In 2013, the Federal District Court for Utah ruled that Utah’s anti-polygamy law was unconstitutional. The state could prevent people from holding two marriage licenses, but it can’t regulate what adults chose to do in private, wrote Judge Clark Waddoup. This was reasoning borrowed from Lawrence v. Texas, the landmark Supreme Court case that struck down anti-sodomy laws in 2003. (The case is being appealed.) A similar argument might prevail here, Lupu said. The key is that these activities are happening behind closed doors. “They’re a club. They screen members. They could do this in their house, except their house isn’t big enough or whatever.” Therefore, the swingers could argue that the government violated their right to sexual privacy when it zoned them out of their property. “I think they could make a pretty good case,” Lupu said. On Tuesday night, I called the main line at the The Social Club, which for now is still operating out of its old location downtown. The person who answered the phone called himself Peter, but declined to give his last name (“What we do — what my wife and I do privately, is between us, you know?”). Proving the old adage that there is no such thing as bad publicity, Peter said that the controversy had brought in scores of new members who either didn’t know the club existed, or thought it was illegal. “The parties have been huge since all this has happened,” he said. “It’s been outstanding, standing-room only.” Hello everyone! I’ll be reading and responding to comments today. To get the discussion started, let me ask you this: Where is the dividing line between secular beliefs and religious beliefs? Should we treat a Catholic with anti-abortion views differently from an atheist with anti-abortion views? Is that an unfair question to ask? And of course, feel free to e-mail me at jeff.guo at washpost.com What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article talks about a private swingers club in Nashville that has rebranded itself as a church so that it can get special treatment under the law. Some people in the community are unhappy about the club being near a Christian school, so they have made zoning problems for it. The club's lawyer argues that the Constitution is on their side, but the definition of a \\"religion\\" is complicated and has been debated in U.S. courts for a long time. The swingers club claims that as a church, they can have tenets similar to the Ten Commandments, like not stealing, not lying, and not cheating. Their lawyer believes that being a church will help protect them from government control since religious institutions have strong protections and freedoms in America. However, if the city tries to stop them from operating as a church, the case could be decided by whether the swingers sincerely believe their religious beliefs or are using it as a cover for their club."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which body of water held more dissolved oxygen?  Hint: The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold. Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on the larger scale. Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during warmest period of the day and during the summer months.

Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet. Choices: A). negative. B). positive. I think the answer is","output":"A). negative. This tweet embodies a negative sentiment due to several factors present in the text. Firstly, the author expresses a lack of desire to attend school by stating, \\"I don't want to go to school yet!\\" This demonstrates that the individual is not looking forward to engaging in their educational pursuits. Furthermore, they mention a \\"stupid typhoon,\\" indicating that they are unhappy about the typhoon's interference with their plans - presumably, they previously used the typhoon as a reason to avoid going to school, and are frustrated that it has moved on and classes have resumed. The author also states, \\"it's gone when you just need it to stop classes!\\" which further highlights their dissatisfaction with the fact that classes have resumed. Their use of an exclamation mark portrays an emotionally charged reaction to the situation, which in this context, comes off as negative. They mention that they \\"don't wanna loose you,\\" the \\"you\\" in this case, referring to the typhoon, suggesting that they wish the storm would reappear or last longer, and consequently, prolong the class suspension. Finally, the phrase \\"don't go\\" further emphasizes the individual's desire for the typhoon to remain, while appealing almost desperately to the fleeting weather phenomenon. This particular statement exposes an emotional vulnerability accompanied by the speaker's displeasure with the current circumstances – all of which contribute to conveying a negative sentiment in the tweet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Reverend Gustav Briegleb (Malkovich) publicizes Christine's plight and rails against the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for its incompetence, corruption and the extrajudicial punishment meted out by its \\"Gun Squad\\" led by Chief James E. Davis (Feore). Several months after Walter's disappearance, the LAPD tells Christine that he has been found alive. Believing the positive publicity will negate recent criticism of the department, the LAPD organizes a public reunion. Although \\"Walter\\" (Devon Conti) claims he is Christine's son, she says he is not. Captain J. J. Jones (Donovan), the head of the LAPD's Juvenile Division, insists the boy is Walter and pressures Christine into taking him home \\"on a trial basis\\". After Christine confronts Jones with physical discrepancies between \\"Walter\\" and her son, Jones arranges for a medical doctor to visit her. He tells Christine that \\"Walter\\" is three inches shorter than before his disappearance because trauma has shrunk his spine, and that the man who took Walter had him circumcised. A newspaper prints a story that implies Christine is an unfit mother; Briegleb tells Christine it was planted by police to discredit her.

Background: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator.  Paragraph: Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores.  The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers.

According to Buckley, \\"If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality.\\" In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, Bowie said, \\"It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me.\\" His first wife, Angie, supports his claim of bisexuality and alleges that Bowie had a relationship with Mick Jagger.In a 1983 interview with Rolling Stone, Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was \\"the biggest mistake I ever made\\" and \\"I was always a closet heterosexual.\\" On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings.Blender asked Bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake.

She struggles with the guilt of a tragedy from her past.  In the same town, Scottie Wilson (33) returns home after an eight-year tour as an Army medic. Haunted by the memories of those he couldn't save, he feels disconnected from his friends and family. Scottie starts working as a local mechanic and becomes known for his aloof demeanor. One day, as Judy's car breaks down, she brings it to the mechanic shop where Scottie works. Scottie, distracted by his thoughts, doesn't pay much attention to her at first. But over time, they're thrown together in various town events and develop a friendship. Act 2: Judy and Scottie discover they share a similar emotional pain, although the details aren't yet revealed. Judy feels a strong connection to Scottie, realizing he's the only person who can understand her past. Meanwhile, Scottie finds solace in Judy's warmth and ability to make him smile again. After months of friendship, Judy musters the courage to confess her secret to Scottie: in high school, she'd been in love with his younger brother, James, who died in a hit-and-run accident that Judy feels responsible for. Overcome with emotions, Scottie leaves. Act 3: Scottie struggles with the revelation, feeling unable to continue their friendship or forgive Judy for her role in his brother's death. Judy, heartbroken, writes a heartfelt letter to him, begging for his forgiveness and explaining that losing James changed her life forever. Scottie is forced to confront his own inability to forgive – not just Judy but also himself for the lives he couldn't save during his deployment. After seeking advice from his father, who shares his own story of forgiveness, Scottie decides to take a chance on forgiveness and healing. In the emotionally charged climax, Scottie finds Judy at the town's annual Memorial Day parade, where a bench with James' name engraved is being dedicated. As they sit together, he finally breaks his silence, forgiving her for the past and also acknowledging his own role in perpetuating pain by not letting go. Epilogue: Months later, Judy and Scottie's friendship has blossomed into a deeper romantic relationship. Together, they work to overcome their past traumas and build a loving, supportive life together in Willow Creek. The final scene shows them hand-in-hand, crossing the bridge where James' accident happened, symbolizing their journey toward forgiveness and true love."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Output:","output":"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors To come up with the answer, I carefully read the given sentence and looked for terms that could potentially represent a gene or protein. In the sentence, \\"Stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors modulates Jurkat T cell growth and adhesion to fibronectin,\\" the term \\"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors\\" stands out as a possible protein since it refers to receptors that enable cell communication and are involved in various biological processes."},{"instruction":"Question: Information:  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus.  - John the Apostle ( Koine Greek: ; Latin: \\"Ioannes\\") was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament, which refers to him as . He was the son of Zebedee and Salome. His brother was James, who was another of the Twelve Apostles. Christian tradition holds that he outlived the remaining apostles and that he was the only one to die of natural causes: Judas Iscariot died by suicide, while the other ten all are considered to have died a martyr's death. This is because the Church Fathers considered him the same person as John the Evangelist, John of Patmos, John the Elder and the Beloved Disciple, although modern theologians and scholars have not formed a consensus on the relative identities of these men. The traditions of most Christian denominations have held that John the Apostle is the author of several books of the New Testament.  - A gospel is an account describing the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. The most widely known examples are the four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John which are included in the New Testament, but the term can also used to refer to apocryphal, non-canonical, JewishChristian and gnostic gospels.  - Nazareth (\\"Narat\\" \\"Narath\\" \\"an-Nira\\") is the capital and the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. Nazareth is known as \\"the Arab capital of Israel\\". In its population was . The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian. Nazareth Illit (lit. \\"Upper Nazareth\\") is built alongside old Nazareth, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014. The Jewish sector was declared a separate city in June 1974.  - John the Evangelist is the name traditionally given to the author of the Gospel of John. Christians have traditionally identified him with John the Apostle, John of Patmos, and John the Presbyter, though this has been disputed by modern scholars.  - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived.  - The New Testament (Koine Greek:   , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.  - The Gospel of Peter (\\"kata Petrn euangelion\\"), or Gospel according to Peter, is one of the non-canonical gospels rejected as apocryphal by the Church Fathers and the Catholic Church's synods of Carthage and Rome, which established the New Testament canon. It was the first of the non-canonical gospels to be rediscovered, preserved in the dry sands of Egypt.  - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion.  - The Christian Church is a term generally used to refer to the whole group of people belonging to the Christian religious tradition throughout history. In this understanding, the \\"Christian Church\\" does not refer to a particular Christian denomination but to the body of all believers. Some Christians believe that the term \\"Christian Church\\" or \\"Church\\" applies only to a specific historic Christian institution (e.g., the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodoxy). The Four Marks of the Church first expressed in the Nicene Creed are unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity.  - John of Patmos (also called John the Revelator, John the Divine or John the Theologian; Greek:   ) is the name given to the author of the Book of Revelation, the apocalyptic text forming the final chapter of the New Testament. The text of Revelation states that the author is called John and that he lives on the Greek island of Patmos, where, by some, he is considered to be in exile as a result of anti-Christian persecution under the Roman emperor Domitian.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - Patmos (Greek, \\"\\";) is a small Greek island in the Aegean Sea, most famous for being the location of both the vision of and the writing of the Christian Bible's Book of Revelation.  - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books.  - Hebrew Bible or Hebrew Scriptures is the term used by biblical scholars to refer to the \\"Tanakh\\", the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is the common textual source of several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament. They are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others).  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - In Abrahamic religions, the Messiah or Messias is a saviour or liberator of a group of people, more specifically, the Jewish people.  - In Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah. This title derives from the Hebrew word ' , meaning \\"My Master\\" (irregular plural ' ), which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. The word \\"master\\" \\"\\" literally means \\"great one\\".  - John the Presbyter was an obscure figure of the early Church who is either distinguished from or identified with the Apostle John, by some also John the Divine. He appears in fragments from the church father Papias of Hierapolis as one of the author's sources and is first unequivocally distinguished from the Apostle by Eusebius of Caesarea. He is frequently proposed as an alternative author of some of the Johannine books in the New Testament.  - The First Epistle of John , often referred to as First John ( US ) or One John ( UK ) ( and written 1 John ) is a book of the New Testament . This fourth catholic or \`\` general '' epistle is attributed to John the Evangelist , traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two Epistles of John . This Epistle was probably written in Ephesus between the years 95 -- 110 . The work was written to counter docetism , which is the belief that Jesus did not come \`\` in the flesh '' , but only as a spirit . It also defined how Christians are to discern true teachers : by their ethics , their proclamation of Jesus in the flesh , and by their love .  - In Christian terminology, docetism (from the Greek \\"doken\\" (to seem) \\"dóksis\\" (apparition, phantom), according to Norbert Brox, is defined narrowly as \\"the doctrine according to which the phenomenon of Christ, his historical and bodily existence, and thus above all the human form of Jesus, was altogether mere semblance without any true reality.\\" Broadly it is taken as the belief that Jesus only seemed to be human, and that his human form was an illusion. The word \\"Doktaí\\" (illusionists) referring to early groups who denied Jesus' humanity, first occurred in a letter by Bishop Serapion of Antioch (197203), who discovered the doctrine in the Gospel of Peter, during a pastoral visit to a Christian community using it in Rhosus, and later condemned it as a forgery. It appears to have arisen over theological contentions concerning the meaning, figurative or literal, of a sentence from the Gospel of John: \\"the Word was made Flesh\\".  - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or   , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions.    What is the relationship between 'first epistle of john' and 'christianity'? Answer:","output":"The First Epistle of John is a book of the New Testament, which is a part of the Christian Bible. It is attributed to John the Evangelist, who is traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two Epistles of John. The First Epistle of John is an essential text in Christianity, as it addresses important themes like the belief in Jesus as the Son of God, the importance of love among Christians, and how to discern true teachers. It was written to counter docetism, a belief that Jesus did not come in the flesh but only as a spirit. Thus, the First Epistle of John plays a vital role in shaping Christian theology, beliefs, and practices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Luton and its near neighbours, Dunstable and Houghton Regis, form the Luton/Dunstable Urban Area with a population of about 258,000. It is located east of Aylesbury, west of Stevenage, north-northwest of London, and southeast of Milton Keynes.  - Bedfordshire (or /bdfd/; abbreviated Beds.) is a county in the East of England. It is a ceremonial county and a historic county, covered by three unitary authorities: Bedford, Central Bedfordshire, and Luton.  - Chicksands is a village in the Central Bedfordshire district of Bedfordshire, England, and part of the civil parish of Campton and Chicksands, whose population in 2007 was estimated to be 2,510. By the 2011 census the figure was accurately placed at being 1,699. The village is on the River Flit and close to its parish village of Campton and the town of Shefford.  - Chicksands Priory is a former monastic house at Chicksands in Bedfordshire .  - Central Bedfordshire is a unitary authority area in the ceremonial county of Bedfordshire, England. It was created from the merger of Mid Bedfordshire and South Bedfordshire District Councils on 1 April 2009. With a budget of £500m the unitary council provides over a hundred services to a quarter of a million people, and is responsible for schools, social services, rubbish collection, roads, planning, leisure centres, libraries, care homes and more.  - Campton and Chicksands is a civil parish in the English county of Bedfordshire.  - The River Flit is a short river in Bedfordshire, England. It flows through Flitwick, then past Greenfield and Flitton, then through Clophill, Chicksands, and Shefford, then past Stanford, before meeting the River Ivel at Langford. Its name is not ancient, but rather a back formation from Flitton.  - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority.

Essex has the highest population in the region.    What entity does 'chicksands priory' has the relation 'located in the administrative territorial entity' with? A:","output":"The entity 'Chicksands Priory' has the relation 'located in the administrative territorial entity' with 'Chicksands', which is a village in the Central Bedfordshire district of Bedfordshire, England. This village is part of the civil parish of Campton and Chicksands. The civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government in England, falling below districts and counties or their combined form, the unitary authority. In this case, the higher level of local government would be the unitary authority of Central Bedfordshire, which was created from the merger of Mid Bedfordshire and South Bedfordshire District Councils on 1 April 2009.  Notably, Central Bedfordshire, the larger territorial entity overseeing Chicksands, is a part of the ceremonial county of Bedfordshire. Ceremonial counties are geographic areas, often aligning closely with historic counties, that are used for the purposes of the lieutenancy, in other words, areas which have a Lord Lieutenant.  Bedfordshire is located in the East of England, a region comprising six ceremonial counties including Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. The East of England is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS - Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics - for statistical purposes. Furthermore, the River Flit flows through the village of Chicksands, adding another layer to the geographical context of Chicksands Priory. Thus, while the immediate administrative territorial entity that Chicksands Priory is located in would be the village of Chicksands within the civil parish of Campton and Chicksands, this in turn is contained within the wider network of territorial entities that include Central Bedfordshire, the ceremonial county of Bedfordshire, and the East of England region."},{"instruction":"Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

The Albanian Fascist Party (Albanian: \\"Partia Fashiste e Shqipërisë\\" , or PFSh) was a Fascist organization active during World War II which held nominal power in Albania from 1939, when the country was conquered by Italy, until 1943, when Italy capitulated to the Allies. Afterwards, Albania fell under German occupation, and the PFSh was replaced by the Guard of Greater Albania. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Albanian Fascist Party (Albanian: \\"Partia Fashiste e Shqipërisë\\" , or PFSh) was a Fascist organization.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the Albanian Fascist Party (Albanian: \\"Partia Fashiste e Shqipërisë\\", or PFSh) was indeed a Fascist organization. This conclusion is based on the historical context of the party, its political ideology, and its association with other Fascist regimes during World War II. The Albanian Fascist Party was formed as a result of the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939. Italy, under the leadership of Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party, aimed to create a Fascist regime in Albania that would be closely aligned with Italian interests. As such, the Albanian Fascist Party was founded on principles of totalitarianism, nationalism, anti-communism, and the glorification of the state, which were common elements in other Fascist movements of the time. The PFSh was led by Albanian politicians who were either supportive of or acquiescent to Italian domination, as they maintained close ties with the Italian authorities and actively promoted their Fascist ideology. The collaboration between the Italian Fascist regime and the PFSh allowed for the establishment of a Fascist government in Albania, under the nominal rule of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. This government, known as the \\"Kingdom of Albania,\\" imposed Fascist policies such as censorship, political repression, and discrimination against minorities. From 1939 to 1943, the PFSh's primary function was to maintain control over Albania on behalf of the Italian Fascist regime. However, when Italy capitulated to the Allies in 1943, the PFSh lost its role as a governing party, as Germany took over the occupation of Albania. In the following months, the PFSh was replaced by the Guard of Greater Albania, which was a collaborationist force supporting the German forces occupying the country. In conclusion, the Albanian Fascist Party was undoubtedly a Fascist organization. Established under the influence of the Italian Fascist regime, it adhered to many of the core principles of Fascism, such as totalitarianism, nationalism, and a centralized authority. Throughout its existence, the PFSh acted as an instrument of Italian Fascist domination in Albania until Italy's surrender and the subsequent German occupation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The complex, at a site known as Tel Burna, is made up of rooms surrounding a giant courtyard measuring 52 feet by 52 feet. It's not certain who the cult worshiped, but based on the \\"letters of Ugarit\\" (a site located in what is now Syria), experts figure it was probably the Canaanite storm god known as Baal. Canaanites, the International Business Times explains, were people living in the region between approximately the early Bronze Age and the beginning of the Common Era. The complex yielded an array of items including pieces of face masks, person-sized ceramic jars, and animal bones that may indicate animal sacrifices took place there. As for the masks, they \\"may suggest ceremonial processions that arrived or left from the complex,\\" a researcher tells LiveScience. In addition, archaeologists found three connected cups whose use they're unsure of, though they note \\"joint vessels similar in concept ... have been considered as cultic objects.\\" Other items found include figurines that appear to show half-human, half-animal beings, as well as an artifact called a scarab, which bears an Egyptian hieroglyph. The Science Times reports that the discoveries show possible religious links between ancient civilizations; though it describes the site as \\"relatively secluded,\\" both the cups and two large jars, for instance, appear to have originated in Cyprus. (In other archeological news out of Israel, a copper awl has prompted a rethinking of ancient history.)

He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife. I just got back into town about an hour ago, so I changed into my uniform, and I’m here for my shift! I learned later that this patrolman had taken it upon himself to contact the man’s wife and the only vehicle they owned was out of gas 200 miles away. So this officer stayed up all day after a working the midnight shift and used his own car for the 400 mile trip.

President Obama, who has said he would veto the House measure if it got as far as his desk, has spoken in favor of the bipartisan \\"Gang of Six\\" senators' deficit-reduction plan. Even as the measure reached the House floor, John Boehner said leaders were looking into a Plan B to raise the debt ceiling, the Hill notes. \\"I’m not going to give up hope on ‘cut, cap and balance,’ but I do think it’s responsible for us to look at what Plan B would look like,\\" he told reporters.","output":"Title: \\"Cut, Cap, and Balance\\" Plan Approved by House of Representatives; Uncertain Fate in Senate Today, the House of Representatives passed the \\"cut, cap and balance\\" plan, a financial regulation bill backed heavily by the Tea Party, a faction within the United States Republican Party known for their conservative fiscal ideologies. The measure, set to continue on to the Senate, is predicted to have a slim chance of gaining approval. The act requires the exacting execution of trillions of dollars in spending cuts and necessitates a balanced-budget amendment to the United States Constitution for any potential increase in the debt ceiling. The decision in the House was largely partisan. The majority of the votes in favor of the plan came from Republican representatives, showing party allegiance with the Tea Party's ideals. Nine Republicans, however, chose to abstain from the vote, hinting at the underlying complexities within the Republican Party. Notable amongst the abstainers were Representative Michele Bachmann and Representative Ron Paul, both staunch conservatives. In contrast, five democrats opted to cross party lines and voted in support of the majority GOP (Grand Old Party, commonly known as the Republican Party). Notably, AP reports indicate President Obama, who has openly stated his intention to veto the House's decision should it reach his desk, has instead expressed support for a bipartisan plan. The president is advocating for the \\"Gang of Six\\" senators' deficit-reduction plan, a proposal that differs significantly from the Tea Party-backed measure. As the \\"cut, cap and balance\\" plan was being debated in the House, Speaker John Boehner spoke to reporters, expressing that the legislative leaders were already contemplating a \\"Plan B\\" for raising the debt ceiling. \\"I’m not going to give up hope on 'cut, cap and balance', but I do think it’s responsible for us to look at what Plan B would look like,\\" Boehner said as reported by The Hill. Despite the approval received in the House, the future of the \\"cut, cap and balance\\" plan remains uncertain. Its progression depends heavily on its acceptance in the Senate and the possible veto threat from President Obama.

News article: Money, Math And Medicine The current state of drug research studies traces back to a 1975 phone call between an executive at what was then the world's largest drug company and a 30-year-old Brit with longish hair and bushy sideburns named Dennis Gillings. The drug giant Hoechst (now Sanofi-Aventis ( SNY - news - people )) hired Gillings, a statistician, to figure out why 56 West Germans had died while taking its diabetes pill. The side effects threatened to doom plans to sell the drug in the U.S. Gillings, then a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, quickly figured out the problem: Patients with kidney failure were building up toxic doses of the drug. The drug made it to the market with alerts about using lower doses in kidney patients. Gillings learned from the incident that there were things drug companies needed done that he could do better than they could. While drug companies were great at inventing new medicines, they were often in over their heads when it came to analyzing mountains of data from clinical trials. \\"It became apparent that there was the possibility of making the pharmaceuticals sector more efficient,\\" explains Gillings, now 66. Inspired by this realization, Gillings founded Quintiles Transnational in 1982 in a 1,000-square-foot house with only five employees. He began to think of drug testing as a process that could be broken down into standardized steps to make it faster. He created a network of doctors interested in enrolling patients in clinical trials. He sent out monitors to doctors conducting a trial to make sure they weren't taking any shortcuts that could cause problems with regulators later on. He hired dedicated data entry people who made sure that every relevant piece of patient information was correctly filed. \\"I don't think many people thought of it like that.\\" His thinking helped foment a revolution in drug development. Today Quintiles is the leader in a secretive and powerful 20 billion industry--outsourcing clinical trials. Over the past decade Gillings' company has conducted 4,700 trials in 2.7 million patients in over half the countries in the world. But exactly which trials is it doing? Quintiles won't say. It says its Big Pharma clients want this to remain a secret. Clinical research organizations (CROs) now have some role in almost all large clinical trials, compared with about a quarter in 1993. Quintiles doesn't disclose profits but has annual sales of 3 billion, 500 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and 400 million in free cash flow. While impressive, these revenues are far short of the 10 billion in sales Gillings predicted Quintiles would have by now in a 2001 FORBES article. Once traded on Nasdaq, Quintiles was taken private in 2003 by a consortium of investors led by Gillings for 1.7 billion. He owns a 24% stake that FORBES values at 700 million including debt. The two other main owners, the private equity firms Texas Pacific Group and Bain Capital, have similar stakes. The School of Public Health at UNC was renamed for Gillings and his wife, Joan, after they made a 50 million gift in 2008. These days Gillings' hair is short and he favors impeccably cut suits. But there is a backlash brewing against Quintiles and other CROs. They raise particular ire among the university doctors who compete with Quintiles for drug company trial business. \\"My view is that they're plagued by high turnover, low quality. I don't know of a single large pharmaceutical company or a large academic research center that's happy with CROs,\\" says Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. Drug companies use them because they save time and money. CROs complete trials an average of two to four weeks faster than those done in academia or industry alone, says the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development. Quintiles conducted a key safety study of the diabetes drug Avandia that was publicly savaged by a Food & Drug Administration reviewer in July. GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK - news - people ) contended that the trial showed that Avandia did not cause heart attacks. But the reviewer found crucial errors in case report forms. Major heart problems in as many as a dozen Avandia patients had never been counted, he concluded. In the wake of the new evidence an expert committee voted to severely restrict the drug's use. Quintiles points to other FDA reports that did not identify any \\"systemic or pervasive findings\\" that would undermine the data. It maintains its monitoring systems were satisfactory. CROs are \\"better than anyone\\" at compiling patient data, says Eric Topol, a Scripps Research Institute cardiologist who served on Quintiles' board of directors in the 1990s. But often \\"they overstep their bounds,\\" he says. CROs are too beholden to their drug company clients to be trusted with analyzing trial results, as they increasingly have been doing, he says.

(EW.com) -- Who had more money thrown at him this weekend? A bong-smoking teddy bear with a bad attitude or Channing Tatum in a sparkly G-string? Surprisingly, the stuffed animal proved the victor! Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane's raunchy comedy \\"Ted,\\" which stars Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, earned an impressive 54.1 million out of 3,239 theaters during its debut weekend -- the third-best debut ever for an R rated comedy behind the openings of \\"The Hangover Part II\\" (85.9 million) and \\"Sex and the City\\" (57 million) -- and the best debut ever for an original comedic storyline. What went right? According to Universal's President of Domestic Distribution Nikki Rocco, \\"The film. The marketing. The advertising -- that's what went right!\\" Still, \\"","output":"Magic Mike\\" didn't fare too poorly either. Steven Soderbergh's male-stripper dramedy, featuring the chiseled likes of Channing Tatum, Alex Pettyfer, and Matthew McConaughey, gyrated into second place with 39.2 million from 2,930 theaters. The film's performance exceeded expectations, as it was initially projected to earn around 20-25 million. While it may not have claimed the top spot, the film's success showcased the drawing power of Tatum and the appetite of audiences for fresh, unconventional storylines. As both films managed to find their niche, they continued to jostle for dominance at the box office. In the following weeks, \\"Ted\\" maintained a strong hold on the box office, despite facing competition from other R-rated comedies, such as \\"The Campaign,\\" as well as summer blockbusters like \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\" and \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\" The film went on to gross over 218 million domestically and 549 million worldwide, solidifying its status as a comedy hit and positioning MacFarlane as a sought-after filmmaker. \\"Magic Mike\\" also enjoyed an extended run at the box office, ultimately earning over 113 million domestically and 167 million worldwide. The film's solid performance eventually spawned a sequel, \\"Magic Mike XXL,\\" released in July 2015. As the summer rolled on, both \\"Ted\\" and \\"Magic Mike\\" remained popular in theaters, proving that originality and daring storytelling could coexist alongside established franchises and special-effects-driven spectacles. Both films carved their respective places in the pantheon of memorable cinematic experiences of the year, delighting and surprising critics and audiences alike. In the end, both \\"Ted\\" and \\"Magic Mike\\" managed to capture the hearts (and wallets) of millions of moviegoers, demonstrating that there's room for a wide range of stories and genres in cinema - from foul-mouthed animated toys to gyrating male dancers. Though vastly different in content and tone, these films helped pave the way for other storytellers and filmmakers to push the creative boundaries of their work. And perhaps, their combined success served as a reminder that amidst the familiar blockbuster sequels and reboots, some of the most cherished moments in cinema can still be found in the unruly, the unexpected, and the downright outrageous."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what kind of currency does cuba use?\\" A:","output":"A: Cuba operates with a dual currency system, consisting of the Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC) and the Cuban Peso (CUP). The usage of these currencies is specific to certain types of transactions and sectors within the country. The Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC) is pegged to the US Dollar, and it is mainly intended for transactions involving tourism and foreign trade. Visitors to Cuba typically use the CUC for purchasing goods and services like accommodations, tours, meals at restaurants, souvenirs, and transportation. By using the CUC, tourists contribute to the foreign exchange income of the country, which is essential for the Cuban economy. However, it is essential to note that due to recent regulations, US dollars are subject to a 10% penalty when exchanged to CUC. As a result, euros, pounds, and Canadian dollars are preferred options for tourists to bring into the country and convert at exchange houses called \\"CADECA.\\" On the other hand, the Cuban Peso (CUP) is the national currency utilized for domestic transactions by the Cuban population. It covers everyday expenses like groceries, utilities, transportation, and some cultural activities. The CUP is also used for salaries and pensions of the Cuban workforce, as well as in government transactions and subsidies. Additionally, some local food establishments and markets are starting to accept CUP from tourists, providing a more authentic Cuban experience for visitors. In recent years, there have been talks about currency unification, intending to reduce the complexities associated with the dual currency system. This process, however, is expected to be gradual and carefully managed by the Cuban government to minimize any potential socio-economic impacts. In summary, while visiting Cuba, it is common to use the Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC) for most transactions involving tourism and foreign trade, while the Cuban Peso (CUP) is principally used in domestic transactions by Cuban citizens. Understanding and adapting to this dual currency system is essential for experiencing the unique economic landscape of Cuba."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What was the last name of the person who used a powerful amplifier in Foo Fighters songs? is inside the article: Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers  and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".  In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\"., can you guess it ?

Q:Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long should athletes probably eat protein? Options: - All the time - even when they aren't working out - Only after working out - not enough information - Only before working out A:","output":"Based on the provided context, it does not specify a particular time when athletes should consume protein. However, it implies that a sufficient amount of protein intake is necessary for muscle growth and repair, which correlates with their training. Therefore, athletes should focus on maintaining a desirable protein intake throughout their diet, matching their specific body and training needs. The answer here would be \\"all the time - even when they aren't working out\\" as their bodies would need consistent protein intake for proper muscle maintenance and recovery even during periods of rest. This doesn't mean an excessive amount of protein but rather a sufficient intake as part of a balanced diet, based on their body weight and the intensity of their training. It's also important to account for factors such as the athlete's overall diet, energy needs, and specific requirements of their sport. Therefore, consultation with a nutritionist or dietitian may be beneficial to determine an individual athlete's specific protein needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The modern version of what code-breaking board game for two players, that resembles an old pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows, was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert?","output":"The modern code-breaking board game for two players invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert, is called Mastermind. This game is an adaptation of the older pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows, and it was designed to challenge the players' logic, deduction, and problem-solving skills. Mastermind, the commercial version of the game, offers a more tactile and visual experience than Bulls and Cows, as it involves a gameboard and pegs of various colors. The gameboard comprises a vertical board with holes for accommodating pegs, a shielded area where the codemaker creates the hidden pattern, and rows where the codebreaker makes their guesses. The objective of Mastermind is for the codebreaker to deduce a hidden color code created by the codemaker within a set number of tries. This hidden code consists of a sequence of colors, usually in a collection of four pegs, and is made up of six available colors (some versions have eight colors). Duplicate colors are allowed, and the player can use any combination they desire. The game proceeds in turns, with the codebreaker placing colored pegs on the board in an attempt to determine the positions and colors within the hidden code. After placing a guess, the codemaker provides feedback by placing smaller pegs (either black or white) in response to the codebreaker's attempt. A black peg represents a correct color in the correct position, while a white peg indicates a correct color in the wrong position. However, the codemaker does not reveal which of the guessed pegs corresponds to the smaller pegs placed, leaving it up to the codebreaker to deduce the information using logic and pattern recognition. The codebreaker continues to make guesses, placing new rows of pegs and receiving feedback from the codemaker until either the codebreaker successfully identifies the codemaker's hidden code or runs out of guessing turns (typically 10-12 turns in most versions). The codebreaker wins if they break the code within the allotted number of turns, while the codemaker wins if their code remains unbroken. Both players can then switch roles and play again, rewarding thoughtful and strategic thinking. Mastermind enjoyed immense popularity after its creation, becoming a bestselling game worldwide during the 1970s and 1980s, with numerous editions and variations being produced since then. In 1977, Invicta Plastics, the company that produced Mastermind, even released an expanded version called Super Mastermind, which increased the difficulty of the game by enlarging the secret code to five pegs and providing eight color choices. Various electronic and computer versions of the game have also been developed, ensuring that this timeless classic remains popular amongst different generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Dwyane Wade isn't 'cocky' enough for a Kobe-style retirement tour Kobe Bryant's retirement tour has consumed this entire Los Angeles Lakers season. Whenever they go on the road, he's serenaded with applause and saluted with gifts and pregame montage videos. The tribute is well deserved, but bloated. He's an all-time great player who deserves all the attention and adoration NBA fans across the world are giving him. That's 100 percent his right. But Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade doesn't think something like that will be for him when it comes time for the 34-year-old to say goodbye (via Sun-Sentinel): Wade said he could not envision himself in the same sphere as Bryant, playing to regular tributes before and after games. \\"I don't know,\\" he said. \\"I don't sit back and say, 'Oh, when I retire.' I'm not that cocky to say, 'I want a farewell tour when I retire.' For me, that's a little too cocky of a mindset to have, thinking I'm that important, that I should get a farewell tour.\\" Wade shouldn't have to worry about retirement for quite some time. Despite a noticeable drop in his night-to-night athleticism, Miami's starting shooting guard is averaging 19.1 points, 4.7 assists and 4.1 rebounds per game. He's shooting 45.3 percent from the floor and his free-throw rate is the same now as it was in 2012. That's remarkable. More importantly, the Heat are good! And so long as Wade keeps his salary down to a reasonable level when free agency negotiations get underway this summer, there's no reason why the team can't be even better next season—with improved youngsters like Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow in the mix, alongside a presumably healthy Chris Bosh, increasingly comfortable Goran Dragic and re-signed Hassan Whiteside. The Eastern Conference should be wide open next year, and Miami will be one squad looking to take it. Bryant is 37 years old and nowhere near his prime, but if there were even the slightest chance the Lakers could have made a deep playoff run over the next few months, there's no chance he'd have announced his retirement when and how he did. What was this article about?","output":"The article centers around the contrasting retirement approaches of two renowned National Basketball Association (NBA) players, Dwyane Wade and Kobe Bryant. Kobe Bryant's retirement was an upscale event that spanned a whole Los Angeles Lakers season, filled with broad public recognition, gifts, montage videos and applause, a tribute that the article deems well-deserved but excessive.  Meanwhile, Dwyane Wade, a Miami Heat guard, sees his own future retirement from a different perspective. He stated that he couldn't envision himself in the same circumstances as Bryant, playing amidst regular tributes before and after games. Wade expressed that planning for a retirement tour was too \\"cocky\\" of a mindset for him to adopt, as it would imply an exaggerated self-importance.  However, the article insinuates that Wade has nothing to worry about when it comes to retirement. Even with his diminishing athleticism, his performance remains strong. He's averaging 19.1 points, 4.7 assists, and 4.1 rebounds per match, shooting 45.3 percent from the floor, and his free-throw rate is the same as it was in 2012.  Moreover, the article highlights that Miami Heat is a good team and could be even better next season. This would be possible if Wade keeps his salary at a reasonable level during the free agency negotiations and if young talents such as Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow continue to improve and if Chris Bosh returns healthy. The team also looks forward to an increasingly comfortable Goran Dragic and a re-signed Hassan Whiteside.  Finally, the article suggests that Kobe Bryant's retirement announcement may have come differently if the Los Angeles Lakers had the slightest chance of making a deep playoff run in the months that followed. This is not the case, which may have influenced the grand retirement approach taken by Bryant, as opposed to Wade's humble approach to the idea of his future retirement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Make lemon water","output":"To make lemon water, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Gather ingredients and tools To make lemon water, you will need: - 1 lemon - Water (preferably filtered or spring water) - A glass or a bottle - A knife - A cutting board - Optional: a juicer for squeezing out more lemon juice - Optional: sweetener like honey, agave syrup, or stevia (if you prefer a slightly sweet taste) Step 2: Wash and prepare the lemon Thoroughly rinse the lemon under running water. This step is important to remove any dirt, bacteria, or pesticides that might be present on the lemon's skin. Step 3: Cut the lemon Place the lemon on the cutting board and, using the knife, carefully slice it in half. You can either cut it lengthwise or across, depending on your preference. Cutting lengthwise usually results in more juice while cutting across makes the lemon easier to squeeze by hand. Step 4: Squeeze the lemon Hold one lemon half over the glass or bottle, and gently squeeze it to release the juice into the container. You may use a juicer to extract more juice if you have one. Squeeze both halves of the lemon or only use one depending on how strong you want the lemon flavor to be. Keep in mind that more lemon juice will make the lemon water more acidic. Step 5: Add water Fill the glass or bottle with water (preferably cold). If you want to make warm lemon water, heat the water first in a kettle or microwave, then pour it over the lemon juice. Step 6: Sweeten (optional) If you prefer your lemon water slightly sweet, add a bit of your chosen sweetener (honey, agave syrup, or stevia) and mix well to dissolve it. Step 7: Stir and enjoy Stir the lemon water to ensure that the lemon juice and sweetener (if used) are well distributed. Your lemon water is now ready to enjoy. Drink it immediately for the freshest taste and maximum health benefits. Note: You can make lemon water in larger quantities and store it in the refrigerator for later use. However, it is recommended that you consume it within a day or two to maintain its freshness and nutrient content."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, given 2 input sentences, you must classify the relation between them.

The answer is:","output":"In order to provide the correct answer to the question \\"what makes the pupils sensitive?\\" considering the given information, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the question The question asks what makes the pupils sensitive. The term \\"sensitive\\" implies that pupils respond to certain stimuli or changes in the environment. Step 2: Analyze the given information The given information is that dilation makes the pupils sensitive. Dilation is the process by which the pupils widen to allow more light to enter the eye. Step 3: Determine the role of nerves In the context of pupil dilation, nerves are responsible for transmitting messages from the brain to the muscles that control the size of the pupils. As a result, nerves play a crucial role in making the pupils sensitive to changes in light levels. Step 4: Assess the role of nerves in relation to the given information Since nerves are involved in the process of controlling pupil size, it is logical to say that they contribute to the sensitivity of the pupils. Step 5: Provide the answer Based on the analysis, it is reasonable to say that the right answer to the question \\"what makes the pupils sensitive?\\" is \\"nerves\\", given that dilation (which is regulated by nerves) makes the pupils sensitive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"In the 1980 television film \\"This Year's Blonde,\\" the Russian-American talent agent Johnny Hyde is portrayed by actor Lloyd Bridges. This film, directed by John Erman, is a biographical drama based on the early life and career of Norma Jeane Dougherty, who would later become famed American actress and model Marilyn Monroe. The story primarily revolves around the relationship between Johnny Hyde and Marilyn Monroe as he helps her navigate the treacherous territory of Hollywood and builds her career, eventually turning her into a star. Lloyd Bridges, born in 1913, was an American actor with an extensive career spanning over six decades and encompassing over 150 film and television appearances. He started his career in acting during the 1930s, working primarily in theatre and transitioning to film and television later. He rose to prominence with his lead role in the television series \\"Sea Hunt\\" (1958-1961), where he played ex-Navy frogman and freelance scuba diver Mike Nelson. Throughout his career, Lloyd Bridges appeared in various well-known films, including \\"High Noon\\" (1952), \\"Airplane!\\" (1980), \\"Airplane II: The Sequel\\" (1982), and \\"Hot Shots!\\" (1991).

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. The answer to this question is:","output":"The answer to this question is Group Jones. Their cans had the air molecules inside move faster, leading to increased pressure and resulting in the cans exploding due to not venting them before heating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Samuel Cook (January 22, 1931 - December 11, 1964), known professionally as Sam Cooke, was an American singer, songwriter, and entrepreneur. Influential as both a singer and composer, he is commonly known as the King of Soul for his distinctive vocals and importance within popular music. He began singing as a child and joined The Soul Stirrers before moving to a solo career where he scored a string of hit songs like \\"You Send Me\\", \\"Wonderful World\\", \\"Chain Gang\\", and \\"Twistin' the Night Away\\". The first funeral service for Cooke was held on December 18, 1964, at A. R. Leak Funeral Home in Chicago; 200,000 fans lined up for more than four city blocks to view his body. Afterward, his body was flown back to Los Angeles for a second service, at the Mount Sinai Baptist Church on December 19, which included a much-heralded performance of \\"The Angels Keep Watching Over Me\\" by Ray Charles, who stood in for grief-stricken Bessie Griffin. Cooke was interred in the Garden of Honor, Lot 5728, Space 1, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.  Two singles and an album were released in the month after his death. One of the singles, \\"Shake\\", reached the top ten of both the pop and R&B charts. The B-side, \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\", is considered a classic protest song from the era of the Civil Rights Movement . It was a top 40 pop hit and a top 10 R&B hit. The album, also titled Shake, reached the number one spot for R&B albums. After Cooke's death, his widow, Barbara, married Bobby Womack. Cooke's daughter, Linda, later married Womack's brother, Cecil.  Bertha Franklin said she received numerous death threats after shooting Cooke. She left her position at the Hacienda Motel and did not publicly disclose where she had moved. After being cleared by the coroner's jury, she sued Cooke's estate, citing physical injuries and mental anguish suffered as a result of Cooke's attack. Her lawsuit sought US200,000 in compensatory and punitive damages. Barbara Womack countersued Franklin on behalf of the estate, seeking 7,000 in damages to cover Cooke's funeral expenses. Elisa Boyer provided testimony in support of Franklin in the case. In 1967, a jury ruled in favor of Franklin on both counts, awarding her 30,000 in damages. Was Cookes attack on her physical in nature","output":"Yes, according to available information, Sam Cooke's attack on Bertha Franklin was physical in nature. On the night of December 11, 1964, Cooke was involved in an altercation with the hotel's manager, Bertha Franklin, at Hacienda Motel in Los Angeles.  Various accounts of the events leading up to Cooke's death suggested that he had taken a woman named Elisa Boyer to the motel, who later ran off with his clothes, claiming that he had tried to rape her. In search of Boyer and his clothes, a frantic Cooke went to the motel office and forcefully entered the manager's office, where Bertha Franklin was present. Franklin testified that Cooke, wearing only a sports jacket and shoes, approached her in a threatening manner, demanding to know the whereabouts of the woman he was with earlier. Fearing for her life, Franklin attempted to restrain him by using a broomstick, eventually resorting to using a firearm. As a result of the ensuing altercation, Cooke was fatally shot. Franklin's account of the incident, in which she stated that Cooke had physically attacked her, was supported by evidence of her injuries and the fact that a struggle had occurred, alongside Elisa Boyer's testimony in court. In 1967, a jury ultimately ruled in favor of Bertha Franklin, awarding her damages in the lawsuit she filed against Cooke's estate for the physical injuries and mental anguish she suffered as a result of the attack."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both the man and the mask have a faint smile on their faces. The rest of the movie answers the questions posed by that enigmatic opening image.In a small town somewhere in Texas, the town kids are trick or treating except for one family sitting at the kitchen table talking about Halloween. The mother, Gladys Perry (Jennifer Griffin), explains that their religious beliefs put them on a higher plane where such activities are forbidden. Just then the doorbell rings and some children outside yell \\"trick or treat.\\" Gladys answers the door and explains they don't participate in the holiday because they are Jehovah's Witness.Meanwhile, Larry Billings, a prison guard, returns to the prison to get some paperwork to do at home even as the two prisoners in their cells (Butch and Terry) consult with an elderly inmate regarding where the vents go. Once Butch and Terry break through the vents, and it is clear that an escape is underway, Butch tells Terry that they will separate when they get free and reach the state line because he doesn't like Terry. And Terry agrees with that plan as their hatred for each other coalesces. Butch and Terry get past the guard at the gate in Larry's car with Larry at the wheel. Once they reach town they commandeer Larry's car and search for a new escape car. Terry is sidetracked by Gladys making breakfast. Terry breaks into the kitchen holding a gun and terrorizes her, grabbing her around the neck for a smooch.

Answer based on context: The Chargers began their season at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum for a Week 1 AFL Legacy duel with their AFC West rival, the Oakland Raiders, in the second game of an MNF doubleheader.  In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as Raiders running back Michael Bush got a 4-yard touchdown run.  The Chargers would strike back in the second quarter as running back LaDainian Tomlinson got a 1-yard touchdown run.  Oakland would respond with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 37-yard field goal.  San Diego would close out the half with kicker Nate Kaeding making a 47-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, the Raiders would retake the lead in the fourth quarter as Janikowski nailed a 35-yard field goal.  The Chargers would take the lead as quarterback Philip Rivers completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Vincent Jackson.  Oakland would respond with quarterback JaMarcus Russell completing a 57-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Louis Murphy, but San Diego came right back with a 5-yard touchdown run by running back Darren Sproles.

Back when James was single, he had numerous opportunities to engage in various activities and hobbies that he enjoyed. He could hang out with friends, attend parties, go on spontaneous road trips, and make last-minute plans without worrying about how it would affect his partner or household. The single life allowed him to discover new interests, meet new people, and gain valuable experiences that contributed to his continuous personal growth. One of the most appealing aspects of single life is the option to date and explore different kinds of relationships with various individuals. The thrill of sharing experiences with diverse partners, each with distinct personalities and quirks, allowed James to learn more about his own preferences and the qualities he values in a romantic partner. Moreover, the excitement of that initial attraction and the butterflies felt during the first dates or romantic encounters were unforgettable experiences that he cherished. Being single also provided James the independence to engage in self-reflection, work on his personal goals, and focus on advancing his career without any distractions. Making major life decisions without considering the repercussions on another person's life or future became a luxury that he could no longer afford in his domestic life. However, despite the excitement that single life provided, James's transition to domestic life brought about stability, emotional intimacy, and shared responsibilities with his partner.

The show documents RuPaul in the search for \\"America's next drag superstar.\\" RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. RuPaul's Drag Race employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews, Carson Kressley, and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. The first season of Drag Race was accompanied by a seven-episode web series, titled Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race. LOGOonline published a webisode of Under the Hood after each episode of Drag Race. In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the green room, replays pertinent moments from Drag Race, and airs deleted footage.  Starting with the second season of Drag Race in 2010, Logo reformatted Under the Hood, increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked. Logo broadcast an episode of Untucked after each episode of Drag Race. Untucked replaces the basic green room of Under the Hood with two decorated rooms that were until season 6 sponsored by Absolut Vodka and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season 6. These two backstage areas allow for separated group conversation.  At the start of the seventh season of the Drag Race, Untucked reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, Untucked was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on.

The lyrics were rearranged by the Lebanese singer Majida El Roumi and music was written by Kadim Al Sahir .","output":"No, these sentences are not paraphrases of each other. They have different meanings due to inaccurately interchanging the roles of Majida El Roumi and Kadim Al Sahir.  In the first sentence, it says that Majida El Roumi wrote the lyrics, and Kadim Al Sahir rearranged the music. It suggests that the original song lyrics were created by Majida El Roumi and Kadim Al Sahir took the existing music and modified it to create a new arrangement. The second sentence, on the other hand, claims that Majida El Roumi rearranged the lyrics, while Kadim Al Sahir wrote the music. This sentence implies that the original song lyrics were modified by Majida El Roumi, and Kadim Al Sahir composed the music for the song. The focus is shifted from Majida El Roumi's role in writing the lyrics to her role in rearranging them, which leads to a misunderstanding. A paraphrase of the first sentence should maintain the information about who wrote the lyrics and who rearranged the music without any alteration, and could be phrased like this: \\"Lebanese singer Majida El Roumi penned the lyrics, while the music was rearranged by Kadim Al Sahir.\\" In this paraphrase, you can see that the roles of Majida El Roumi and Kadim Al Sahir remain consistent with the original sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Women live longer than men partly because their immune systems age more slowly. Women live longer than men partly because their immune systems age more slowly, a new study has revealed. As their body defences weaken with the passing years, the increasing susceptibility of men to disease shortens their lives, it is claimed. Life expectancy in the UK is 79 years for men and 82 for women, according to the World Health Organisation. In Japan, where the research took place, the gap is wider. There, the average lifespan of men is the same as in the UK, but women live to 85.5. The study involved examining blood samples from healthy volunteers with a wide range of ages. Scientists tested the blood of 356 men and women aged between 20 and 90 and looked at levels of white blood cells and immune system signalling molecules called cytokines. In both sexes, the number of white blood cells per person decreased with age, but closer study revealed striking differences between men and women. The rate of decline of most T-cell and B-cell lymphocytes, two key elements of the immune system, was faster in men. Similarly, men showed a more rapid age-related decline in the two cytokines, IL-6 and IL-10. Two specific types of immune system cell that actively destroy foreign invaders, CD4 T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells, increased in number with age. In this case, the rate of increase was higher in women than in men. NK cells are believed to be one of the body's first lines of defence against cancer. The research, led by Professor Katsuiku Hirokawa, from Tokyo Medical and Dental University, appears in the online journal Immunity and Ageing. The scientists wrote: ‘Age-related changes in various immunological parameters differ between men and women. Our findings indicate that the slower rate of decline in these immunological parameters in women than in men is consistent with the fact that women live longer than do men.’ Immune system mechanisms not only protect the body from infection and cancer, but can cause disease when not properly regulated. In both sexes, the number of white blood cells per person decreased with age but the rate of decrease was quicker in men. Inflammation is a potentially damaging immune system response that contributes to heart and artery disease and could play a role in dementia. The cytokine IL-10 is an important regulator of inflammation, helping to put the brakes on the immune system to keep it under control. Its faster decline in men suggests that as men age they might more rapidly be affected by inflammatory conditions. Professor Hirokawa said: ‘The process of ageing is different for men and women for many reasons. Women have more oestrogen than men which seems to protect them from cardiovascular disease until menopause. Sex hormones also affect the immune system, especially certain types of lymphocytes. ‘Because people age at different rates, a person's immunological parameters could be used to provide an indication of their true biological age.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"1. Women's immune systems age more slowly than men's, contributing to their longer life expectancy. 2. The rate of decline of key immune system elements, T-cell and B-cell lymphocytes, is faster in men. 3. Men show a more rapid age-related decline in cytokines, IL-6 and IL-10, affecting their immune system response. 4. The increase in immune system cells (CD4 T-cells and natural killer cells) with age is higher in women. 5.

A. wait for  B. dress nice  C. go for haircut  D. bathe  E. shave  The best answer is A:","output":"The best answer is B. dress nice. In the given scenario, it appears that the individual is placing a significant amount of importance on the date, even though it may not be entirely necessary based on the person they are meeting (\\"it wasn't shaggy\\"). However, this eagerness and excitement for the date can be attributed to the individual's personal desire to make a good impression.  The remaining options are: A. Wait for C. Go for a haircut D. Bathe E. Shave Option A, \\"wait for,\\" is not an ideal choice, as waiting for something is not an active measure the individual can take to prepare for the date. Additionally, it is not contextually clear what the person might be waiting for in this instance. Option C, \\"go for a haircut,\\" does not seem to be a pressing concern based on the statement that their date is not \\"shaggy\\", indicating that the individual's hair is likely not unkempt or in need of significant grooming. Option D, \\"bathe,\\" is essential for general hygiene, but it is not particularly specific to the situation. It is a commonplace action that most people engage in before going on a date or attending an event. Option E, \\"shave,\\" might be related to personal grooming, but it seems less relevant in this context, as the focus is on the overall appearance and presentation. Therefore, the best answer is B: dress nice. Dressing nicely is an active choice that the individual can make to reflect the significance they place on the date.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In 1966,Allen and Beatrice Garden, two professors at the University of Nevada in Reno, had a bright idea.They were interested in the evolution of language and the language abilities of great apes  . Previous attempts to teach chimpanzees  to talk had ended in failure and the matter was considered by most people to be closed. But the Gardens realized that speech and the language are not the same thing. Many deaf people, for example, are unable to speak but are perfectly able to communicate by gestures that have all the features of spoken language. The Garders suspected that previous experiments had failed because chimpanzees are physically unable to speak.    They therefore decided to try teaching a chimpanzee to sign in the way that deaf people do. And their chosen  _ , a female chimpanzee named Washoe after the country in which the university is, proved to be a skillful pupil. Though there is still debate about whether what Washoe learned was really equal to human language, there is no doubt that she learned a lot of words. All of this, however, raises a second question. If Washoe can learn a complex vocabulary of gestures from people, do they have such vocabularies naturally ? To examine that possibility, Amy Pollick and Frans de Waal of Emory University have looked at gestures and expressions in chimpanzees,    Signaling by facial and oral expressions is common among primates  . Signaling by gestures is limited to great apes. The researchers supposed that the meaning of expressions has been fixed by evolution while the meaning of gestures is learnt. If that were true, particular sorts of facial and oral expressions would occur only in particular circumstances, and this would be the same across groups and even species. The same gestures, on the contrary, would be used in different circumstances. The researchers found exactly what they expected. Expressions almost always occurred in the same circumstances in different groups and different species. Gestures seemed to have completely different meanings.... Answer:","output":"Which statement is correct regarding the reasons behind Allen and Beatrice Garden's decision to teach chimpanzees sign language, based on the article? A. They believed that chimpanzees already had an innate ability to use sign language. B. They wanted to prove that chimpanzees were not intelligent enough to learn sign language. C. They knew that great apes naturally have complex vocabularies and wanted to build on that knowledge. D. They suspected that previous experiments had failed due to chimpanzees being physically unable to speak. In the article, Allen and Beatrice Garden, professors at the University of Nevada in Reno, decided to teach a chimpanzee to sign like deaf people because they realized that speech and language are not the same thing. They suspected that previous attempts to teach chimpanzees to talk had ended in failure because chimpanzees are physically unable to speak. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (; Hindustani: ['mo:h@nda:s 'k@r@mtS@nd 'ga:ndhi] ( listen); 2 October 1869 - 30 January 1948) was an Indian activist who was the leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule. In 1919, Gandhi then aged 49, after the World War I was over, sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917-18. Gandhi had already supported the British crown with resources and by recruiting Indian soldiers to fight the war in Europe on the British side. This effort of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I. The British government, instead of self government, had offered minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi. Gandhi announced his satyagraha (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the Rowlatt Act, to block Gandhi's movement. The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for \\"preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial\\".  Gandhi felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (ummah). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey.  The increasing Muslim support for Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt satyagraha demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature as the political leader to the British. His support for the Khilafat movement also helped him sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the satyagraha non-cooperation movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan.  By the end of 1922 the Khilafat movement had collapsed. Turkey's Ataturk had ended the Caliphate, Khilafat movement ended, and Muslim support for Gandhi largely evaporated. Muslim leaders and delegates abandoned Gandhi and his Congress. Hindu-Muslim communal conflicts reignited. Deadly religious riots re-appeared in numerous cities, with 91 in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh alone. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Is there anything you found particularly interesting?","output":"Yes, I found it interesting how Mohandas Gandhi, an important leader in India, tried to bring Hindu and Muslim communities together. He did this by supporting the Khilafat movement, which was important for many Muslims. For a while, this helped to stop violence between the two groups. But, later, the movement ended and unfortunately, the fighting between Hindu and Muslim people started again. It shows how difficult it can be to bring people together when they have different beliefs but also how leaders like Gandhi can have a big impact on people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- As royalty from different parts of the world converged on the Netherlands to watch the monarchy change hands, some of the guests there may have been thinking ahead to the day when they get the top job back home. In Europe, most monarchs are getting old and have been on their thrones for years. Their offspring are grown up and are now waiting in the wings to take their respective crowns. Britain's Prince Charles was in Amsterdam to watch Queen Beatrix hand over to her 46-year-old son Willem-Alexander. He was also in the Netherlands when Beatrix herself took the throne from her mother 33 years ago on Queen Juliana's abdication.

Article: When you exercise your option, you buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying stock at the price stated in the contract. If your options have value relative to the actual stock price, you are \\"in the money.\\"  A call option allows you to buy stock at the stated strike price. You'll make money if the stock is trading at a higher price than your stock price, because you can buy shares at your lower strike price. You could then turn around and sell those shares at the actual price to make money. If you have put options, you have the right to sell stock at the strike price listed on your contract. You'll make money if you exercise your options when the stock is selling at a much lower price on the open market. You are essentially forcing someone to buy shares at a higher price. You can then buy more shares at the lower price, or simply pocket the difference. For example, if you own a call option for stock at the strike price of 50, and the stock is currently selling at 100, you are \\"in the money\\" because you can buy the stock for half the price it's actually trading for. Likewise, if you owned put options for stock at the strike price of 100, and it is currently selling at 50, you are \\"in the money\\" because you can force someone to buy the stock at twice the price it's currently trading for. If you have American-style options, you can exercise them at any time – you don't have to wait until the expiration date. Exercising an option well before the expiration date means losing potential value. However, waiting it out comes with a risk that the stock price won't move the way you've predicted.  For example, suppose you are in the money on call options that don't expire for 6 months. You could exercise them now and buy the stock at your strike price. However, if the stock continues to rise, you could potentially make more money by exercising the option later. Even with American-style options, most options aren't exercised until close to their expiration date. This gives options holders the opportunity to maximize the time value of their options. To exercise a put option, you must first own the underlying stock. If you're exercising a call option, on the other hand, you need the resources to purchase the underlying stock at the strike price. Your broker may have its own rules about how much money you need to have in your account to exercise your options. Call customer service or check the educational resources on your broker's website for specific rules. You can't trade options without a broker. If you have an online broker, you may not have to do anything more than click a button. Your broker will take several steps behind the scenes to exercise your options for you.  The process is somewhat complex, but in reality it typically only takes a few minutes. You don't have any sort of relationship with the investor who is assigned the options you exercise. In fact, you likely won't even know who they are. The process is done electronically by the relevant options clearing house. When your options have been exercised, your broker will deposit your profits (less fees and commissions) into your account. For a put option, you'll have a cash deposit. For a call option, you'll have shares in the underlying stock. Commissions and fees for the transaction will be deducted from your account. If you exercised a call option, the commissions and fees will come out of the cash in your account, not from selling the shares of stock you purchased through your options contracts. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is: When you exercise an option, you can buy (call) or sell (put) a stock at a specific price stated in the contract. If the stock price is more favorable than your contract price, you are \\"in the money.\\" Call options let you buy shares at a lower price, while put options let you sell shares at a higher price. Exercising options comes with risks and potential rewards, so it's usually done close to the expiration date. To exercise options, you need a broker and enough resources to buy or sell the stock. Your broker takes care of the process, and your profits (minus fees) are deposited into your account."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer: Income includes wages and salaries, unemployment insurance, disability payments, child support payments received, regular rental receipts, as well as any personal business, investment, or other kinds of income received routinely. Question: what is the average american income The answer is:","output":"The concept of household income encompasses various sources of earnings, as indicated in the original question, inclusive of wages, salaries, unemployment insurance, disability payments, child support payments received, regular rental receipts, and income derived from personal businesses, investments, or other routine sources. When it comes to determining the average American income, it is essential to consider different aspects, such as the median household income, mean (average) household income, and even individual income. The most commonly referenced metric for understanding average American income is median household income. This represents the midpoint of all household incomes, meaning that half of the households earn above this level and half earn below. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey (the most recent data available at the time of writing), the median household income in the United States was 68,700. However, if you want to focus on the mean (average) household income rather than the median, the statistics are slightly different. Mean household income is calculated by dividing the total income of households by the number of households. This value can sometimes be skewed by higher-income households, causing the average to be somewhat higher than the median. For 2019, the U.S. Census Bureau reported a mean household income of approximately 94,700. It's also important to consider individual income, which refers to the income earned per person in a household, regardless of the number of earners. According to the 2019 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median personal income for all American workers (both full and part-time) was around 41,950, while the mean personal income was approximately 55,790. It's important to note that these figures are likely to vary depending on age, education, occupation, and a range of other factors. In conclusion, the concept of \\"average American income\\" can be assessed through multiple perspectives. While median household income at 68,700 offers a good overall measure of the financial standing of American households, it is equally important to consider other aspects such as mean household income (94,700) and individual income (median 41,950 and mean 55,790) to gain a thorough understanding of the income distribution in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: myanmar junta chief sets ground rules for polls Text:","output":"In a recent development, the Myanmar junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, has established the ground rules for the upcoming polls in the country. This follows the military coup in February 2021, which led to the overthrow of the democratically elected government and imprisonment of its leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The junta chief's gesture is seen as an attempt to pave the way for the military to maintain control over the political landscape, while providing a semblance of democratic procedure. The ground rules set forth greatly impact the country's electoral process, as they directly influence the conduct and outcomes of the polls. Firstly, these ground rules outline the basic criteria for political parties and candidates. All participants must adhere to the guidelines set by the military, which may potentially limit the freedom of expression and choice for those involved in the elections. Furthermore, the military retains the power to disqualify any political party or candidate that fails to comply with the established regulations, which could result in a biased representation of the people's will. Secondly, the junta chief's ground rules emphasize the importance of maintaining order and security during the electoral period. This involves deploying military forces to monitor the conduct of the polls and ensure compliance with the regulations. While this measure claims to protect the integrity of the election process, it may also instill fear and intimidation among voters and political activists, thereby suppressing the true voice of the people. Lastly, the ground rules specify that the election commission will be responsible for counting and validating the votes. However, critics argue that the military's influence over the commission may lead to discrepancies in the electoral results. This lack of transparency and independence can potentially undermine the legitimacy of the polls. In conclusion, the Myanmar junta chief's announcement of ground rules for the upcoming polls marks a contentious development in the country's political landscape. These regulations, while claiming to be democratic, may inadvertently serve the interests of the military regime, hindering the restoration of representative democracy in Myanmar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the world's biggest selling copyrighted board game????","output":"The world's biggest selling copyrighted board game is Monopoly. Monopoly was first published by Parker Brothers, now a subsidiary of Hasbro, in 1935. It's regarded as the most commercially successful board game in U.S. board game history. The game is named after the economic concept of monopoly—the domination of a market by a single entity. Monopoly Gameplay: The game is designed to be played by two to eight players. Players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels, borrowing money from the bank, and collecting rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them all into bankruptcy, leaving one monopolist in control of the economy. The game board represents a miniaturized, stylized version of a city. Traditionally, the city has been Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the United States, but versions of the game have been created based on multiple cities around the world. Historical Background: The origins of Monopoly can be traced back to 1903, when Elizabeth Magie, a feminist, engineer, and writer, created a board game called 'The Landlord's Game'. The game was designed to demonstrate the economic ill effects of land monopolism and the use of land value tax as a remedy for them. In 1935, Charles Darrow, an unemployed domestic heater salesman, claimed the idea as his own and sold it to Parker Brothers. Impact and Sales: Over more than eight decades, Monopoly has been published in 47 languages and sold in 114 countries. More than 275 million game sets have been sold worldwide. In regards to digital versions, they have been developed for platforms like iOS, Android, and gaming consoles. Versions of Monopoly: Over time, different versions and themes of Monopoly have been produced, ranging from the likes of Star Wars Monopoly to Disney Monopoly. Special editions like Monopoly: Fortnite Edition have also been wildly popular among fans. Monopoly has also been made into slot and lottery games, reality TV shows, and video games.  Monopoly, with its common experience of tense family gameplay, has become a cultural icon, symbolizing the pitfalls and triumphs of capitalism. Its longevity and adaptability to new platforms have ensured its place as the world's biggest selling copyrighted board game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What if the wind does not blow? What if the blowing pollen does not land on another flower? The wind could even blow the pollen over the ocean where it is wasted. Giving free nectar is costly. It is not a good use of the plants energy. A plant uses a lot of energy to produce nectar. Some animals may just drink the nectar. They may not carry off any pollen in return. To improve their chances, plants evolved special traits. For example, they developed ways to hide their nectar. Only certain animals were able to get at the plants hidden nectar.

Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"toxins.\\" When you burn green plants, they can be used to produce electricity through a process called biomass energy conversion. Biomass refers to any organic material derived from plants or animals that can be used to generate energy. When green plants or other biomass sources are burned, their stored chemical energy is released as heat. This heat can be used to produce steam, which then drives a turbine to generate electricity. While burning plants does release some pollutants like carbon dioxide and other particulate matter, it is inappropriate to say that the main product is toxins.

Gossip website TheDirty.com claims to have acquired more sexually explicit online chats between Anthony Weiner and a young woman — chats that the site claims took place after Weiner resigned from Congress in disgrace in 2011. The site claims Weiner used the laughable name \\"Carlos Danger\\" in some of his messages and sent sexually-charged messages as late as last summer.      Weiner responded to the allegations, saying, \\"while some things that have been posted today are true and some are not, there is no question that what I did was wrong.\\" Read the full statement.      Update, 5:40 p.m.: At a press conference this evening, standing next to his wife Huma Abedin, Weiner began by reading his earlier statement. He introduced himself as a Democratic candidate for Mayor. \\"In many ways, things are not that much different than they were yesterday,\\" he continued, repeating his assertion that he expected more such communications to emerge.      He also addressed the timing of the revelations. Some of them, he stated, happened before he resigned from office, some after — though he wasn't clear which messages to the anonymous person fell into which category.      Weiner then turned the podium over to his wife. \\"Our marriage, like many others, has had a lot of ups and downs,\\" she said. \\"Anthony's made some horrible mistakes, both before he resigned from Congress and after. … But I do very strongly believe that that's between us.\\" She concluded: \\"I love him. I have forgiven him. I believe in him.\\"      \\"As I've said, it's in our rear view mirror — but it's not far,\\" he said toward the end of the press conference. Asked when the last text or message was, Weiner said it occurred last summer, after he and his wife gave an interview to People magazine. That article, which introduced his newborn child to the world, included this line:      \\"Anthony has spent every day since [the scandal] trying to be the best dad and husband he can be,\\" [Huma] says of her husband, who does all the laundry. \\"I'm proud to be married to him.\\"      Weiner then stopped answering questions, insisting that he wouldn't get into a back-and-forth with anyone presenting new messages.      Original story: In three posts, The Dirty shares screenshots from chats allegedly involving Weiner. One is from Facebook, with Weiner asking the unidentified woman to delete her chats. Another contains chats from Formspring.com in which a user named \\"Dangr33\\" makes sexually explicit comments. (The avatar for that account, apparently of a model named \\"Krysta Kaos,\\" is at left.) The third includes a Facebook message checking in after \\"the onslaught\\" to see if \\"we are ok.\\" That post also includes a censored photograph purportedly including Weiner's penis.      Here's what we know about this mystery person, whom The Dirty refers to as a \\"young female girl.\\" The site says that she and Weiner had a relationship for six months; in a statement, she says she was 22 at the time. That relationship, the site claims, was primarily centered around phone sex — they spoke \\"daily multiple times a day.\\" At one point, Weiner offers to propose that she be included in a panel of bloggers organized by Politico, implying she works in media. (Politico's events page doesn't include any such panel.) Her Formspring account name appears to start with an \\"s\\" and end with an \\"o.\\" Not much to go on.      There are several reasons to be skeptical of the claim that this was a relationship that happened after Weiner's behavior became public — if it happened at all. None of the screenshots include information about the date, but only the time of day. The only mention of the scandal involving Weiner, from that third message, seems to clearly indicate that Weiner and the recipient of the message knew each other before the scandal became public. The Dirty indicates that Weiner contacted her last August to help her get a condo in Chicago, but it's, again, not clear how that timeline lined up with the explicit relationship. If any: The explicit messages are all from the \\"Carlos Danger\\" account.      Update, 1:30 p.m.: We have at least one indication that the person involved in some Facebook messages was, in fact, candidate Anthony Weiner. One exchange included the following reference to Weiner's cats.      At the time that Weiner's original exchanges came to light, the image at right was included among them. It shows Weiner seated on a couch with two cats. Someone who worked closely with Weiner in the past contacted us and attested that Weiner does indeed have a cat with one eye. So there's that.      Update, 3:00 p.m.: A new post at The Dirty offers a timeline from the recipient of Weiner's messages. According to her:      The two began communicating last July.      On July 19, Weiner started following her on Formspring.      By August, the two were exchanging explicit messages over email and Formspring. At this point, Weiner allegedly offered to get the condo in Chicago.      By November, the relationship had all but ended.      When The Times' profile of Weiner came out in April (see below), he sent her a Facebook message to ask what she thought.      Again, these details haven't been confirmed.      When he announced his candidacy for mayor of New York City, Weiner did warn that additional texts might come out. That campaign has been largely predicated on asking city residents whether or not he deserves the benefit of the doubt on the whole affair. In an interview with The New York Times in April — which also mentions the two cats — he said:      \\"I want to ask people to give me a second chance. I do want to have that conversation with people whom I let down and with people who put their faith in me and who wanted to support me. I think to some degree I do want to say to them, 'Give me another chance.'\\"      Whether or not he gets the benefit of the doubt in this case could decide if he gets that chance. It could be the point on which his future ambitions hinge.      Update, 2:25 p.m.: Anthony Weiner issued a statement in response.      I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out, and today they have. As I have said in the past, these things that I did were wrong and hurtful to my wife and caused us to go through challenges in our marriage that extended past my resignation from Congress. While some things that have been posted today are true and some are not, there is no question that what I did was wrong. This behavior is behind me. I've apologized to Huma and am grateful that she has worked through these issues with me and for her forgiveness. I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption that this has caused. As my wife and I have said, we are focused on moving forward.      Want to add to this story? Let us know in comments or send an email to the author at pbump at theatlantic dot com.

Rodent models are an indispensable tool for studying etiology and progress of depression. Since interrelated systems of neurotrophic factors and cytokines comprise major regulatory mechanisms controlling normal brain plasticity, impairments of these systems form the basis for development of cerebral pathologies, including mental diseases. The present review focuses on the numerous experimental rodent models of depression induced by different stress factors (exteroceptive and interoceptive) during early life (including prenatal period) or adulthood, giving emphasis to the data on the changes of neurotrophic factors and neuroinflammatory indices in the brain. These parameters are closely related to behavioral depression-like symptoms and impairments of neuronal plasticity and are both gender- and genotype-dependent. Stress-related changes in expression of neurotrophins and cytokines in rodent brain are region-specific. Some contradictory data reported by different groups may be a consequence of differences of stress paradigms or their realization in different laboratories. Like all experimental models, stress-induced depression-like conditions are experimental simplification of clinical depression states; however, they are suitable for understanding the involvement of neurotrophic factors and cytokines in the pathogenesis of the disease-a goal unachievable in the clinical reality. These major regulatory systems may be important targets for therapeutic measures as well as for development of drugs for treatment of depression states.","output":"Title: Exploring Stress-Induced Rodent Models of Depression: Neurotrophic Factors, Neuroinflammation, and Implications for Treatment"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If there isn't one, give me your opinion on why this  analyst would say such a stupid thing. Second, give me one reason why the  lead is journalistically incorrect, and one why it is gramatically  unattractive. Then you get details. Kate  Write a subject line for this email.","output":"Subject: Understanding the Difference Between Overcharges and Excessive Charges, Analyzing ISO's Statement, and Evaluating the Lead of the Article Dear Kate, Thank you for sharing the article with me and seeking clarification on the points raised in the news piece. The difference between \\"overcharges\\" and \\"excessive\\" charges can be subtle, but it may carry important implications in certain contexts. Here's a detailed explanation of these terms and an analysis of the quote from the ISO market analyst. 1. Difference between \\"overcharges\\" and \\"excessive\\" charges:    - Overcharges: This term generally implies that a customer has been billed more than what they should have been, with the assumption that a mistake or an intentional act led to a higher price than the agreed-upon or reasonable rate. In this context, it often carries an implication of misconduct or a breach of contract.    - Excessive charges: This term, on the other hand, is broader and typically refers to high prices that might be deemed unreasonable but not necessarily incorrect. A charge can be excessive even if technically correct, like high prices due to natural market fluctuations or unforeseen circumstances. In the article, when the analyst says, \\"We are not saying now that these are overcharges,\\" it seems that they are trying to avoid accusations of misconduct or impropriety on the part of generators and suppliers. However, their use of the term \\"excessive\\" acknowledges that the charges are higher than what the system operator believes is reasonable. 2. Journalistic and Grammatical analysis of the lead:    - Journalistically incorrect: This lead might be considered journalistically incorrect due to the way it frames the situation. The use of the word \\"stunning\\" in reference to the 6.2 billion in refunds implies that the story is biased or editorialized. As per journalistic principles, a news report should strive for objectivity, and by labeling the sum \\"stunning,\\" the reporter may have failed to maintain the required impartiality.    - Grammatically unattractive: From a grammatical perspective, the lead seems to be constructed of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction, making it a compound sentence. However, the sentence structure and punctuation can be improved for better readability. For instance, it would be more grammatically attractive to rephrase the lead as follows: \\"The California Independent System Operator significantly increased its demands on Thursday by telling the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that 21 generators and suppliers should refund the state a staggering 6.2 billion for electricity sold since last May.\\" In conclusion, it's crucial to understand the nuance between \\"overcharges\\" and \\"excessive\\" charges and evaluate the analyst's statement from that perspective. Furthermore, while the lead of the article does raise concerns regarding journalistic accuracy and grammatical appeal, rephrasing it can improve its overall quality. Please feel free to reach out if you have any more questions or require further clarification on this topic.

I was intrigued with how cool the place seemed overall but a bit apprehensive since she has steered me down the wrong path once.  At this place, they offered a bunch of typical breakfast fare with a sort of a modern fusion twist.  That is the best that I can describe it.  Be prepared, the portions are HUGE!  I like to think that I have a hearty appetite, but this is enough to share for two--at least for breakfast.  Dinner or lunch might be a bit different.  SERVICE We showed up on a Monday morning and the place was hopping at 10:30.  We didn't have to wait too long before our table became readily available.  Overall, the service was great and friendly.  We were checked upon often and coffee cups were always refilled.  FOOD The food was really good and impressed with how fresh things tasted.  No Krusteaz Costco pancake mix here!  Here is a breakdown of what we ordered. - Banana Brown Sugar Pancake: Holy moly!  They serve up a whopping huge pancake that is almost served up on a serving platter.  I would say that the pancake is about 1.5 feet in diameter.  My husband could only tear through about half of it.  The brown sugar was a nice touch as it was added to the top of the pancake and then browned to almost caramel.  OH!  They also have different flavors of pancakes, different fruits, coconut mango, snickers and more! - Bacon Waffle: If you are a fan of the salty sweet.  This is a must try.  When I ordered it, I thought that there would be sprinkles of bacon throughout the waffle.  Instead, there were actual strips which crisscrossed throughout the waffle.  Fancy.  TIP #1: Come hungry.  Do not order any sides since all portions are literally super sized.  TIP #2: If you can, come on a weekday vs. a weekend.  This place gets ridiculously crazy busy.

Which entity is this text about? Haruki Murakami (Cun Shang  Chun Shu , Murakami Haruki, born January 12, 1949) is a Japanese writer. His books and stories have been bestsellers in Japan as well as internationally, with his work being translated into 50 languages and selling millions of copies outside his native country. The critical acclaim for his fiction and non-fiction has led to numerous awards, in Japan and internationally, including the World Fantasy Award (2006) and the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award (2006). His oeuvre received, for example, the Franz Kafka Prize (2006) and the Jerusalem Prize (2009). Sputnik Sweetheart was first published in 1999, followed by Kafka on the Shore in 2002, with the English translation following in 2005. Kafka on the Shore won the World Fantasy Award for Novels in 2006. The English version of his novel After Dark was released in May 2007. It was chosen by The New York Times as a \\"notable book of the year\\". In late 2005, Murakami published a collection of short stories titled Tokyo Kitanshu, or Dong Jing Qi Tan Ji , which translates loosely as \\"Mysteries of Tokyo.\\" A collection of the English versions of twenty-four short stories, titled Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman, was published in August 2006. This collection includes both older works from the 1980s as well as some of Murakami's more recent short stories, including all five that appear in Tokyo Kitanshu.  In 2002, Murakami published the anthology Birthday Stories, which collects short stories on the theme of birthdays. The collection includes work by Russell Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Claire Keegan, Andrea Lee, Daniel Lyons, Lynda Sexson, Paul Theroux, and William Trevor, as well as a story by Murakami himself. What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, containing tales about his experience as a marathon runner and a triathlete, was published in Japan in 2007, with English translations released in the U.K. and the U.S. in 2008. The title is a play on that of Raymond Carver's short story collection, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.  Shinchosha Publishing published Murakami's novel 1Q84 in Japan on May 29, 2009. 1Q84 is pronounced \\"ichi kyu hachi yon\\", the same as 1984, as 9 is also pronounced \\"kyu\\" in Japanese. The book was longlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize in 2011. However, after the 2012 anti-Japanese demonstrations in China, Murakami's books were removed from sale there, along with those of other Japanese authors. Murakami criticized the China-Japan political territorial dispute, characterizing the overwrought nationalistic response as \\"cheap liquor\\" which politicians were giving to the public. In April 2013, he published his novel \\"Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage\\". It became an international best seller but received mixed reviews.","output":"This text is about Haruki Murakami, a famous Japanese writer.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted.  Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer.  As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows. The answer to this question is:","output":"Professor Kristan's mother was bitten by a vampire bat in Africa while she was hiding in a cave along with a group of explorers. The context reveals that she was pregnant at the time of the bite, and due to the events that unfolded in the film, it is suggested that the traits of vampirism were passed down to her son, Professor Kristan, through Lamarckism. This inheritance ultimately led to the series of mysterious murders committed by Kristan in his trance-like state, instigated by his mother's fateful encounter with the vampire bat in Africa."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Three of the women have been linked to a website that accepts ads for escort services, police have said. In the latest case, one of the two women found early Christmas Day in the trunk of a car that had been set afire was identified as Vernithea McCrary, 28, the investigator said. The second victim remains unidentified, said the investigator, who asked not to be identified because he is not allowed to speak on the record to the news media. The bodies of two other women found December 19 have been identified as Demesha Hunt, 24, and Renisha Landers, 23. They were found in the trunk of Landers' Chrysler 300. Causes of death for the four women were pending toxicology results, which typically take six to eight weeks to be completed, the investigator said. The process of identification can be difficult. \\"People hear of someone that is discovered that we bring down here and they call down here and inform us that someone is missing,\\" the investigator said. \\"They give us a description and then they come down if they can be viewed and are recognizable.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: 1634: The Bavarian Crisis, precededBy, \\"DeMarce short stories in the The Grantville Gazettes\\". Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The data provided refers to a historical event, a book, and associated short stories which are all set within the same literary universe. In order to offer a comprehensive understanding of this information, it is necessary to explore each aspect individually and then establish their connection to each other. 1. 1634: The Bavarian Crisis This historical event is the backdrop for a novel of the same name, written by Virginia DeMarce and Eric Flint. Published in 2007 as part of the 1632 book series, which Flint kicked off in 2000, the novel is an alternate history tale that presents a divergent course of European history. Set in the year 1634, this particular novel focuses on the various political and military challenges faced by the European countries during the Thirty Years War (1618-1648). The key plot driver is a crisis in Bavaria, which reaches its climax when an attempt to abduct the Swedish queen, Maria Eleonora, fails. 2. Preceded By: DeMarce Short Stories in the Grantville Gazettes The data suggests that 1634: The Bavarian Crisis is preceded by short stories written by Virginia DeMarce that have appeared in the \\"Grantville Gazettes\\". The Grantville Gazettes, edited by Eric Flint, are official online magazines which allow both established and new authors to contribute short stories, articles, and essays set within the 1632 book series universe. These short stories provide readers with additional context and background information for the main novel series. In this case, specific short stories from the Gazettes written by DeMarce have likely laid the groundwork for the events and characters depicted in \\"1634: The Bavarian Crisis\\". 3. Connection Between the Data Points The connection between the historical event (\\"1634: The Bavarian Crisis\\") and the short stories by Virginia DeMarce in the Grantville Gazettes can be analyzed from two perspectives: a. Chronological Link: The short stories by DeMarce in the Grantville Gazettes logically precede the events in 1634: The Bavarian Crisis, providing valuable background information and setting the stage for the novel. In this sense, readers who have been following the Gazettes would apprehend the events in the book with increased clarity and understanding thanks to the familiarity gained from the short stories. b. Literary Collaboration: Eric Flint and Virginia DeMarce have a history of collaboration within the 1632 book series universe. Flint is the series creator, while DeMarce has been a contributing author to several volumes, including the Bavarian Crisis. The short stories in the Grantville Gazettes, therefore, also serve as a platform for DeMarce to hone her craft and establish her unique voice within the series. Moreover, it is an opportunity for the two authors to collaborate further and build the rich alternate historical universe introduced in the main 1632 series. In conclusion, the data provided encompasses a historical event (\\"1634: The Bavarian Crisis\\") from an alternate history novel co-written by Eric Flint and Virginia DeMarce, which in turn is preceded by a series of short stories contributed by DeMarce in the \\"Grantville Gazettes.\\" These short stories extend the depth and detail of the 1632 universe and influence the progression of the main novel series, with special emphasis on \\"1634: The Bavarian Crisis\\" as a pivotal moment in this fascinating alternate-history reinterpretation of early modern Europe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Maneuvering slowly through grassy Cambodian terrain, a caravan of 20 men and women is on a search-and-rescue mission. Dressed in military fatigues, they are guided by a fearless leader who calculates every step and ensures the safest path for his comrades. It takes just minutes for the unit to confront the first of many hidden targets: a muddied 20-year-old land mine buried a few inches beneath the ground. \\"This is an active land mine made from Russia. [If] we step on [it] ... it explodes and cuts the leg off,\\" says Aki Ra, leader of the Cambodian Self Help Demining team. He and his group are working to make their country safer by clearing land mines -- many of which Aki Ra planted himself years ago. Aki Ra, a Cambodian native who does not recall his birth year, was a child soldier during the communist Khmer Rouge regime, a genocidal crusade responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Cambodians during the 1970s. He was raised by the army after being separated from his family during the internal conflict. Around age 10, Aki Ra estimates, he was given a rifle that measured his own height. Soon after, he was taught to lay land mines. For three years, Aki Ra worked as a mine layer for the Khmer Rouge. He then did the same job for the Vietnamese army that overthrew his village. \\"I maybe planted 4,000 to 5,000 land mines in a [single] month,\\" said Aki Ra, who says he's about 40 years old now. \\"We planted them all over the place.\\" Watch a slideshow of some young land-mine victims Aki Ra has helped. According to the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority, an estimated 4 million to 6 million land mines were laid in Cambodia during three decades of conflict. The mines were planted to defend strategic military locations, target warring opponents and deny the use of roads. \\"I had [bad] feelings, because sometimes we were fighting against our friends and relatives,\\" Aki Ra said. \\"I felt sad when I saw a lot of people were killed. A lot of people were suffering from land mines. [But] I did not know what to do, [because] we were under orders.\\" Approximately 63,000 civilians and soldiers have been in accidents involving land mines and other explosive weapons, according to the Cambodian Mine Victim Information System. Nearly 19,000 of them were killed. Today, Cambodia reportedly has one amputee for every 290 people, one of the highest ratios in the world. When the United Nations came in the early 1990s to help restore peace to Cambodia, Aki Ra saw an opportunity to begin undoing the damage he and others had done. He started training with the U.N. and helping them clear mines. It was around this time he got the name he goes by today. He was born Eoun Yeak, but he was so skilled at clearing mines that his supervisors began comparing him to AKIRA, a heavy-duty appliance company in Japan. One reportedly commented, \\"He works just like an AKIRA.\\" The name stuck. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes. In 1993, one year after working with the U.N., Aki Ra decided to begin clearing mines alone. \\"Some of the areas I was clearing were places where I used to plant mines before,\\" he said. \\"I didn't have any equipment. ... I clear by knife, by stick.\\" For Aki Ra, this bare-hands technique \\"wasn't dangerous. It was easy.\\" But easy didn't mean legal. The method was not in accordance with international standards, which requires protective gear and other professional equipment. So in 2005, he went to the United Kingdom to receive formal training and accreditation. In 2008, Aki Ra formed his nonprofit demining organization. Comprised of native Cambodians, it includes former soldiers and war crime victims. One of the workers is an amputee who lost a leg to a land mine. \\"[Our] goal is to clear land mines in rural villages for the people who need the land for building houses or farming or building schools,\\" Aki Ra said. Aki Ra and his organization devote all of their donated funds to clearing Cambodia's rural \\"low-priority\\" villages. These villages, populated primarily by poor farmers, do not always receive first dibs for minefield clearance projects because of their remoteness and limited traffic. At times, they're completely overlooked. \\"Villagers report land mines every day, and they ask us to destroy [them],\\" Aki Ra said. \\"The people are afraid of mines. Whether there are a lot of land mines or only a few, [we] still have to clear the area so that the people in the village can be safe.\\" Kuot Visoth, chief of Prey Thom village, was relieved when the team arrived in early July to clear his village. \\"I know the area around the school has a lot of land mines, and I am afraid that when the children come to school and play, they will step on them, or the villagers' buffaloes grazing in the area would be killed,\\" Visoth said. Aki Ra estimates that he and his group have cleared more than 50,000 land mines and unexploded war weapons such as bombs and grenades. The Cambodian government says there are 3 million to 5 million mines still undiscovered. Many of Aki Ra's recovered land mines and unexploded weapons are on display at a museum in Siem Reap. For 2, visitors can touch defused mines and bombs as well as AK-47 rifles and war uniforms. \\"I had an idea to open a land mine museum to teach people to understand about war, land mines,\\" he said. \\"Even though the war [is] finished, [these explosives] still kill people, and the land cannot be used.\\" Also at the museum is an orphanage that Aki Ra and his wife, Hourt, opened about a decade ago. Roughly 100 children, some injured by land mines, have been cared for over the years. The orphanage provides food and shelter for the children and sends them to public school. \\"I brought them to the museum because I could provide them with [a] better situation,\\" Aki Ra said. \\"If I didn't help them, they would have a very difficult life.\\" The orphanage's first resident, Sot \\"Tol\\" Visay, lost a leg to a mine. He was living on the street when Aki Ra was demining in his province. Aki Ra offered Visay a home, and Visay has spent the past seven years living there. \\"This place has been very good to me,\\" said Visay, now 21. \\"Mr. Aki Ra does not want anything from me. Instead, he encourages all people here to study, to gain knowledge.\\" Hourt died last year from a stroke, leaving Aki Ra to care for his three biological children and 27 orphans ages 10 to 20. Aki Ra is thankful to have caretakers, teachers, a chef and a driver who help look after the children during his demining missions, which can last up to 25 consecutive days every month. \\"All the children living in my center I consider as my own children. They call me father,\\" said Aki Ra, whose efforts in Cambodia will be highlighted in an upcoming documentary, \\"A Perfect Soldier.\\" \\"I have told them about my personal life. They understand all about my history. I tell the children that they should study hard, do good acts and love each other.\\" Want to get involved?

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Gothic Revival (also referred to as Victorian Gothic, Neo-Gothic or Jigsaw Gothic, and when used for school, college, and university buildings as Collegiate Gothic) is an architectural movement that began in the late 1740s in England. Its popularity grew rapidly in the early 19th century, when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture, in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time. Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style, including decorative patterns, finials, scalloping, lancet windows, hood mouldings, and label stops.  - A finial or hip-knob is an element marking the top or end of some object, often formed to be a decorative feature. In architecture it is a decorative device, typically carved in stone, employed decoratively to emphasize the apex of a dome, spire, tower, roof, or gable or any of various distinctive ornaments at the top, end, or corner of a building or structure. Where there are several such elements they may be called pinnacles. Smaller finials in materials such as metal or wood are used as a decorative ornament on the tops or ends of poles or rods such as tent-poles or curtain rods or any object such as a piece of furniture. These are frequently seen on top of bed posts or clocks. Decorative finials are also commonly used to fasten lampshades, and as an ornamental element at the end of the handles of souvenir spoons. The charm at the end of a pull chain (such as for a ceiling fan or a lamp) is also known as a finial.  - Collegiate Gothic was an architectural style subgenre of Gothic Revival architecture, popular in the late-19th and early-20th centuries for college and high school buildings in the United States and Canada, and to a certain extent Europe. A form of historicist architecture, it took its inspiration from English Tudor and Gothic buildings.  - Gothic architecture is a style of architecture that flourished in Europe during the high and late medieval period. It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. Originating in 12th-century France and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as \\"\\" (\\"French work\\") with the term \\"Gothic\\" first appearing during the later part of the Renaissance. Its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault (which evolved from the joint vaulting of romanesque architecture) and the flying buttress. Gothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great cathedrals, abbeys and churches of Europe. It is also the architecture of many castles, palaces, town halls, guild halls, universities and to a less prominent extent, private dwellings, such as dorms and rooms.  - A lancet window is a tall, narrow window with a pointed arch at its top. It acquired the \\"lancet\\" name from its resemblance to a lance. Instances of this architectural motif are typical of Gothic church edifices of the earliest period. Lancet windows may occur singly, or paired under a single moulding, or grouped in an odd number with the tallest window at the centre.   - Gothic Revival architecture in Canada is an historically influential style , with many prominent examples . The Gothic Revival was imported to Canada from Britain and the United States in the early 19th century , and rose to become the most popular style for major projects throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries . The Gothic Revival period lasted longer and was more thoroughly embraced in Canada than in either Britain or the United States , only falling out of style in the 1930s . The late 19th and early 20th centuries was also the period when many major Canadian institutions were founded . Throughout Canada many of the most prominent religious , civic , and scholastic institutions are housed in Gothic Revival style buildings . In the 1960s and 1970s several scholars , most notably Alan Gowans , embraced Canadian Gothic Revival architecture as one of the nation 's signature styles and as an integral part of Canadian nationalism . While largely abandoned in the modernist period , several postmodern architects have embraced Canada 's neo-Gothic past .

We have: 4191 * o + 1991 = 4242 * o + 614 First, we want to get all the \\"o\\" terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. To do that, let's subtract 4191 * o from both sides: 1991 = (4242 - 4191) * o + 614 Now, it looks like this: 1991 = 51 * o + 614 Next, let's move the 614 to the left side by subtracting it from both sides: (1991 - 614) = 51 * o This becomes: 1377 = 51 * o Now, we just need to find out what \\"o\\" is.

Q: Text: first post ever... technically this fuck up took place last night. at least i think it was before midnight...  this fuck up starts as i was finishing my shift at the pub yesterday. we get a complimentary shift drink and meal for every shift we work. and since i work in the kitchen, i \\"sample\\" almost all the meals i cook. so after snacking all day, i was thirsty. really thirsty! i usually have a beer or maybe a shot of whiskey before i go home and have my daily six pack. usually... but yesterday was different. it was my friday. and there were some exceptionally generous customers hanging out. said generous customers decided that instead of just one drink, i needed three.  i came up with a delicious concoction of tequila, orange juice, cranberry juice, pineapple juice and tropical redbull. and since i know the bartender, it's always a little heavy on the tequila. fast forward to not wanting to go home and drink alone. i called a female friend i've know most of my adult life. she and her husband are hosting a gaggle of house guests. including his brother, his brothers wife and their three kids. bed time rolls around and all six kids go to their crashing post. all's well so far. the adults go out back and smoke a bowl and a cigarette. we all have a beer or glass of wine. so far it's a pretty chill evening. then my buddy remembers that he has a bottle in the freezer and demands we all do shots with him... this is about checkout time for me! i vaguely remember taking that one shot.  i wake up at around 4am on their couch with a small baby blanket over my legs. and decide that it's a good time for me to slip out since i undoubtedly was snoring like a rhino after i passed out.  foggy headed, i drive the short distance home, strip and fall into my own bed. successful friday night done and over without major catastrophe... or so i thought. i wake up at 8 and text my female friend thanking her for the blanket and apologizing for passing out on her couch. she has a new baby so she generally doesn't respond unless a response is required or prompted. today was different. immediately she replies: \\"you're a fucking punk! you owe me!!\\" i was a little more than confused... how much could have happened after i stopped remembering things?? well... after we took that shot, they broke out their new set of cards against humanity. and we did what any self respecting adults full of booze and weed would do. we sat at the kitchen table and played a wholesome game of cards. none of this is within my memory. so after texting her for a bit, i discover that at one point, i whipped out my member and was showing it to the group. as if that isn't embarrassing enough... shortly before i passed out, i whipped it out for a second time. this time it wasn't to show it off. this time i had to piss. i threw my cards at the table, got up, whipped it out, and pissed right there at the base of the chair i was just sitting in. to make things worse, i pissed on the cards that weren't fortunate enough to actually land on the table. supposedly i turned my back and went straight to the couch. leaving everyone stunned and horrified by what i had just done.    update: talked to my friends... they weren't happy about my stunt. although they assured me that it was only 11:00pm when i passed out. and my short drive home was less than 6 blocks. i'm sure that if i'd been stopped by a police officer, i would have been in trouble for duii. i've always know reddit to be a generally kind and caring community... but never expected so much kind and concerned advice from complete strangers. thank you reddit! i've known for some time now that i am indeed an alcoholic. you're kind words and the sheer embarrassment of my actions have brought me to the conclusion that i need to stop drinking. but i know myself well enough to know that i will not be able to turn it off over night. i have been alcohol free since that night. and am giving up all hard alcohol. from now on, i will be a beer only man. this far in life, i've never been able to consume enough beer to act the way i did that night. i know it's not a perfect plan. but it's the first attempt at what will certainly be a long road. thanks again reddit!

Please answer the following question: -  Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of this process, which describes the formation of fossils through a method called permineralization, is the eventual solidification of the minerals and uncovering of the fossil after millions of years. To elaborate on this final step, after the organic materials of the remains have decomposed and left only trace amounts, minerals carried by groundwater gradually infiltrate the pores and cavities within the plant or animal's remains. Over time, these minerals precipitate and begin to solidify, effectively turning the organic remains into stone. This process preserves the original structure of the remains, creating a detailed fossil that can provide valuable information about the organism's appearance, behavior, and environment. As sediment continues to accumulate on top of the fossil, pressure and heat gradually increase, facilitating further mineralization of the remains and helping to solidify the surrounding rock. Over the course of millions of years, the various layers of sediment may transform into sedimentary rock, such as sandstone, limestone, or shale. Tectonic forces and natural erosional processes (e.g., rain, wind, glaciers, and the actions of rivers and oceans) can eventually expose the fossil to the surface—either by uplifting the rock layers or by eroding away the overlying material. At this point, the fossil may be discovered by happenstance or through targeted scientific expeditions. In summary, the last step in the permineralization process is the solidification of the mineral deposits that have replaced the organism's remains and the eventual uncovering of the fossil through geological forces and erosional processes. This culmination of the fossilization process reveals a beautiful and informative snapshot of the planet's ancient history, preserving vital information about extinct species and past ecosystems for future generations to study and appreciate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Okay, let me explain this in a simple way for you.  Alexis de Tocqueville was a man from France who lived a long time ago, from 1805 to 1859. He was important because he thought a lot about how people can live together and help each other, especially in big groups like in a country. He wrote two very famous books. The first book was called \\"Democracy in America.\\" He wrote it after visiting the United States. In this book, he tried to explain why people in America could live happily and peacefully even though they come from different places. He also looked at how people can work together to make decisions. The second book was called \\"The Old Regime and the Revolution.\\" In this book, he talked about a big event in France called the French Revolution. He thought that the reason why it happened was because people wanted to change how their country was run, but they didn't know exactly how to do it. Tocqueville believed in something called \\"parliamentary government,\\" which means having a group of people who talk together and make decisions for everyone in the country. He thought that too much democracy, where everyone makes decisions, might not always be the best thing. So, basically, Alexis de Tocqueville was a smart man who wrote books to help people understand how to live together happily and peacefully in a big group like a country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In many situations, you'll need to blend in if for nothing else than to keep the wildlife from scurrying away from you so you can study it (in addition to protecting yourself!) Master how to build a fire. This one is pretty basic: you need heat and you need to cook food (at least to keep up your morale). You can also keep wild animals at bay if need be with fire. Be able to collect water. If your stash runs out, you'll be in dire straits unless you're able to collect water naturally. Knowing you have this as an option will let you breathe easier. Learn how to build shelter. To keep away from animals, bugs, and bad weather, you'll need a shelter. It will also be nice to have a place to call home. Master basic first aid.

If you're not, you'll go through the time spent on your trip not coming back with a thing. This project is all about being attentive. If you're going with a team, make sure you're utilizing numbers as much as possible. Everyone should have their own area they're covering to make sure no stone goes unturned. In exploring, it’s a good idea to have a plan. However, will you stick to that plan? Likely never. When you notice something intriguing that takes you away from it, go for it. It’s sometimes the littlest of things that lead to the biggest adventures. This is where your mapping and tracking skills will come in handy. When you go off course, you'll need to be able to get yourself back on it. Be sure you leave a trail you can take back, and/or plot your new course on a map as accurately as possible. What good is exploring if you come back and can’t fully remember what you’ve seen, heard, and done? You want to keep your memories as vivid as possible – so write it down! You'll need these for the project when you get back.  Make charts, too. They're vivid and more illustrative of what it is you're experiencing – and they're quicker than writing out an essay about every little detail you're seeing. You can also reference these later to look for anomalies and patterns. Take time out of the day (or night) to do this. You don’t want to constantly have your head stuck in a book – or you might miss exactly what it is you went looking for. Take a broken branch on the ground. On the outside, it’s pretty insignificant. But if you actually think about where it came from and how it got there, it can lead you to a number of conclusions. Is a wild animal nearby? Was there a fierce storm recently? Is the tree dying? Take even the smallest things, put them together, and you may find answers. This trip, in the end, will be about conclusions. You'll need to take everything you've seen and piece it together until it becomes one giant, coherent puzzle (ideally, of course). In piecing it together, you'll be able to see what sticks out and deserves attention. In addition to going out there with gusto and taking the world by storm, sometimes you just have to sit back and let it take you by storm. Be still. Observe.

Premise: \\"They want coal and oil.\\"\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"They want fossil fuels.\\" true? Options: (i) yes; (ii) it is not possible to tell; (iii) no;","output":"(i) Yes Based on the premise \\"They want coal and oil,\\" it is reasonable to assume that the hypothesis \\"They want fossil fuels\\" is true. Here's a detailed explanation as to why this is the case. Fossil fuels are a category of energy sources that were formed from the remnants of ancient plants and animals over millions of years. The most well-known and widely used fossil fuels are coal, oil, and natural gas. These energy sources derive their energy from the sun and are released when they are burned. In the premise, it is stated that \\"they\\" want coal and oil, which are both types of fossil fuels. The specific mention of coal and oil implies an interest in energy sources that belong to the category of fossil fuels. There are no other sources of energy mentioned in the premise, so it is safe to assume that the interest is exclusively in fossil fuels. The hypothesis \\"They want fossil fuels\\" encompasses the desire for coal and oil, as these are two prime examples of fossil fuel energy sources. When considering that these energy sources are being sought out in the premise, it strengthens the validity of the hypothesis. Moreover, the premise narrows down explicitly which fossil fuels \\"they\\" want, further supporting the idea that the overarching hypothesis is accurate. Since coal and oil are both mentioned, and there is no indication that any other energy sources are being considered, the hypothesis can be considered true based on the given information. In conclusion, based on the premise \\"They want coal and oil,\\" the hypothesis \\"They want fossil fuels\\" is true. The specific mention of coal and oil supports the hypothesis, as both of these energy sources fall under the category of fossil fuels. Without any conflicting information or mention of alternative energy sources, it is safe to assume that the hypothesis is accurate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt . In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished.","output":"Tim, who studied males during puberty, observed that the growth spurt is triggered by testosterone.

Hillary Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday, but Clinton's narrow victory in Indiana will likely send the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on to the next round of primaries. Sen. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, greet supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina. As polls closed in Indiana, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Obama, but by the end of the evening, Clinton's lead had shrunk, dragging the race out until early Wednesday. A clear winner did not emerge until 1:15 a.m. Wednesday -- seven hours after the polls closed -- because results were slow to come in from Lake County, a Chicago suburb in northwestern Indiana with several precincts that went strongly for Obama.

Say this using Spanish","output":"Con los conflictos ahora internacionalizados, es necesario buscar mecanismos democráticos a nivel planetario. En los tiempos actuales, donde los problemas y desafíos ya no se limitan a las fronteras nacionales, es fundamental reinventar y adaptar los sistemas democráticos existentes para abordar estos asuntos de manera más eficiente y sostenible. Uno de los primeros pasos para lograr esto es promover la cooperación y el diálogo entre los países y sus líderes. El establecimiento de foros globales, donde las distintas naciones puedan expresar y discutir sus inquietudes y objetivos, puede ayudar en la creación de soluciones multilaterales y consensuadas.  Además, es vital que haya una mayor participación ciudadana en la toma de decisiones internacionales. Facilitar la involucración de la sociedad civil en organismos internacionales, como las Naciones Unidas y sus múltiples organismos, permitiría a los ciudadanos influir en las políticas y regulaciones que afectan a todo el planeta. También es esencial promover la educación y la concienciación sobre los asuntos globales entre la población, para que las personas puedan tomar decisiones informadas en cuestiones que trascienden las fronteras nacionales. Una alternativa para garantizar una representación más equilibrada de los intereses a nivel mundial es la creación de instituciones supranacionales democráticas. Estas organizaciones podrían concentrarse en áreas específicas y funcionar de manera similar a los sistemas democráticos nacionales, pero abordando cuestiones en una escala global, tales como el medio ambiente, la economía y la justicia social. Asimismo, debemos recordar que una democracia planetaria no puede ser uniforme en todos los países, sino que debe ser inclusiva y respetuosa de las diferencias culturales, políticas y sociales existentes en el mundo. Es importante buscar y diseñar modelos democráticos adaptativos, que puedan integrar la diversidad de enfoques, valores y sistemas de gobierno sin imponer un único modelo ideal. Por último, no debemos olvidar el papel de las tecnologías en este proceso. La era de la información y la comunicación ofrece una oportunidad única para replantear y mejorar los sistemas democráticos existentes. La creación de plataformas digitales y el uso de herramientas tecnológicas para facilitar y ampliar la participación ciudadana a nivel global, podría permitir un acercamiento más directo y accesible a la democracia planetaria. En resumen, en una época donde los conflictos y desafíos trascienden las fronteras nacionales, resulta imprescindible buscar y poner en marcha mecanismos democráticos que permitan abordar estos asuntos a nivel planetario. La cooperación internacional, la participación ciudadana, el respeto a la diversidad, el fortalecimiento de instituciones supranacionales y el aprovechamiento de las tecnologías son aspectos clave en este proceso de construcción de una democracia planetaria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place.

Article: In 1969, Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross published a book called \\"Death and Dying\\" about her work with terminally ill patients. She developed a model for what she called the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Everyone grieves differently, and these stages do not necessarily unfold in a set order—but the model may give you perspective on your own process. The first reaction to learning of the death of a loved one is to deny the reality of the situation. It is a normal reaction to rationalize overwhelming emotions; indeed, denial is a defense mechanism that dulls the immediate shock. This carries you through the first wave of pain and bewilderment. As the masking effects of denial begin to wear down, you may be flooded by the painful reality of the situation. If you aren't ready for this pain, you may subconsciously deflect it toward others: friends, family, strangers, or inanimate objects. Try to maintain perspective and recognize this deflection. You can't help what you feel, but you choose whether or not to let these feelings control you. Many people react to feelings of helplessness and vulnerability by attempting to regain control. In terminal patients, this often takes the form of desperate measures to cling to life. In mourning, this often manifests as rumination: If only I had been there for her... If only we had gotten to the hospital sooner... If only, if only, if only. When the desperate bargaining subsides, you may be unable to avoid the reality of the situation. You may worry about the cost of the burial or feel an acute sense of regret. You may feel empty, sad, alone; you may despair at ever moving on with your life. This is part of the healing process. Take your time. The final stage of grief unfolds as you begin to move on. This stage is characterized by withdrawal and calm. Accept that your loved one has moved on, and acknowledge that you, too, must move on. Embrace the present as the new reality, and come to terms with the permanence of what has happened. Acceptance does not happen overnight. It does not necessarily mean that you are happy—only that you have moved beyond the denial, the anger, the bargaining, and the depression. Just like a forest that has burned slowly heals, sprouts, and blooms again, your life will bloom again with new hope. Give it time. What is a summary?","output":"In 1969, Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross introduced the five stages of grief in her book \\"Death and Dying.\\" The stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, and they offer perspective on the grieving process.

Often, the hardest part about opening up to your parents is starting the conversation. Take some time and decide what you want to say.","output":"If you are a teenager experiencing emotional or mental health challenges, seeking therapy can be an important step in improving your well-being. As a teen, it can be challenging to communicate your thoughts, feelings, and concerns to others, particularly your parents. Here are some steps you can follow to seek therapy and open a discussion with your parents: 1. Reflect on your reasons for seeking therapy: Whether you are struggling with anxiety, depression, self-esteem issues, or relationship problems, take some time to honestly evaluate your thoughts and feelings. Understanding your specific needs for therapy can help you communicate your concerns more effectively to your parents. 2. Do your research: Before you speak to your parents, do some research on different types of therapy that may be beneficial for you. This could include individual counseling, group therapy, or specific treatments such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). If possible, also gather information on local therapists, their specialties, and potential costs. 3. Choose the right time, place, and setting: Plan when and where you would like to have this conversation with your parents. Choose a comfortable and quiet place where you won't be interrupted. It's also essential to pick a time when your parents are likely to be relaxed and receptive. 4. Communicate with honesty and openness: In your conversation, try to express your feelings as honestly as possible. You may want to use \\"I\\" statements to describe your emotions, thoughts, and experiences. Be prepared to provide examples of situations or instances that have led you to believe therapy can be beneficial. 5. Be persistent: It's possible that your parents may not immediately understand or support your decision to seek therapy. If this is the case, remain calm and continue to communicate your reasons for wanting to speak to a professional. It might take some time for them to accept and support your decision, so be patient. 6. Address concerns and ask for support: Your parents may have questions about the therapy process or may not fully understand why you need therapy. Recognize and address their concerns. Explain the potential benefits of therapy and how it can help you work through your issues. Request their support during your therapy journey, whether that support comes in the form of locating a suitable therapist, setting appointments, or helping with finances. 7. Make a plan together: If your parents are supportive of your decision, work together to find a therapist that is right for you. Discuss logistics such as the frequency of sessions, transportation, and how therapy will be financed. 8. Follow up: Keep the lines of communication open with your parents as you embark on your therapy journey. Update them on your progress and share your experiences. This will not only help to maintain their support but also keep them involved in your emotional and mental well-being. Remember that seeking therapy as a teenager is a brave and responsible act. By following these steps, you can effectively communicate with your parents and gain their support in taking control of your mental health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Caroline, Countess of Derby is one of Baron Braybrooke's daughters. Undoubtedly the Earl of Grantham would sympathise with his predicament. An elderly baron with eight daughters and a 6,000-acre estate faces his title being passed to a distant cousin – because he has no sons. The dilemma echoes the plot of ITV series Downton Abbey, where the Earl of Grantham grapples with the problem of having three daughters but no male heir. But in the real-life drama, the case of the 10th Baron Braybrooke has prompted a campaign to change the ancient law that stops daughters from inheriting titles. Peers are asking the Government – which is already legislating so that if the Duke and Duchess  of Cambridge’s firstborn is a girl she can accede the throne – to make an amendment to the rules covering hereditary titles. His eldest daughter, Amanda Murray, scaled down her business as an interior designer to take over the reins at the vast estate. But when her father dies, his title – created in 1788 – will pass to a distant cousin she has never met, because peerages can only go to male heirs. Mrs Murray, 50, said she was aware the predicament of herself and her sisters – who include Caroline, Countess of Derby – might arouse public irritation rather than sympathy, but added: ‘It boils down to this: if I was a boy, I would be sitting pretty. ‘My poor father had no son, just lots of daughters. In this day and age, with supposed equality, why am I not allowed to inherit my father’s title? It is discriminatory. ‘I am managing the estate, including the steam railway, so I am already doing a man’s job.’ It was a similar scenario in the ITV drama when the Earl of Grantham, played by Hugh Bonneville, was horrified to discover that Downton Abbey would pass on his death to distant cousin – and ‘country solicitor’ – Matthew Crawley, played by Dan Stevens. But in the series, the problem was solved when Matthew fell  in love with and married Lady Mary, the eldest of the Earl’s  three daughters. A similar problem also affected Elizabeth Bennett and her four sisters in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. They faced being left penniless because, with no male heir, their fortune was due to pass to cousin William Collins, whom none of them wanted to marry. In real life, upon the 10th Baron Braybrooke’s death his title will pass to Richard Neville, a fourth cousin once removed. Mr Neville, 35, is single and owns a flat above a hairdressing salon in South-West London. Mrs Murray said she knew nothing about him, although Mr Neville has said he has met the baron and some of his other daughters, and rode on the Audley End miniature railway in the 1980s. The entrepreneur, who has a stake in events and venue website thehandbook.com, has declined to discuss the baronetcy. Real life dilemma: Baron Braybrooke (pictured centre with his wife, right, and one of his daughters, Amanda Murray second from left) will leave his estate to a distant cousin they barely know. Heir apparent: Richard Neville (pictured with an unknown woman), a fourth cousin once removed, is set to inherit the 6,000-acre estate. He currently lives in a flat above a hairdressing salon in South-West London. But while he will inherit the title, it remains unclear whether he will automatically gain ownership of the estate. Audley End is a 17th century country house and renowned as one of the finest Jacobean houses in England. It was requisitioned during the Second World War and used by the Special Operations Executive, the forerunner of MI6. Mrs Murray said her father had. examined whether the title could skip a generation and pass to her son,. who is 20 – but the law is clear that it may not. Stately home: The Jacobean-style  Audley End House. Powerless: In Downton Abbey, the Earl of Grantham's daughters (pictured) cannot inherit the estate because they are girls. Heir: The character of Matthew Crawley (pictured) was set to inherit Downton Abbey, even though he is a distant cousin. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Baron Braybrooke has a big problem because he has no sons, only daughters. He owns a huge estate, but when he dies, his title and possibly his estate will go to a distant cousin, not to his daughters. This is because of an old law that says only boys can inherit titles. Many people think this law is not fair because girls should be allowed to inherit titles too. This situation is similar to the story in the TV show Downton Abbey, where the daughters cannot inherit their father's title. Baron Braybrooke's daughters, including Caroline, Countess of Derby, think the law should be changed to let girls inherit titles as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.  I am facing a new situation today: John is a soil scientist. He has been studying the lands near Mississippi delta. He noticed cases of hypoxia in that are. He labeled that study as case A. To compare that to other areas he visited Arizona. There he didn't see any occurrence of hypoxia. He labeled that case as case B.

Please answer the following question: If the amount of daylight is caused by the tilt of the earth's axis, then what determines the amount of daylight earth gets?  Answer choices: - Heat energy  - The darkness it gets  - The bending of a ray of light  - The tilt of the axis  - The tilt of the sun's axis  - electromagnetic energy  - The brightness of the earth  - rain or sun shine A:","output":"The amount of daylight Earth gets is primarily determined by the tilt of the Earth's axis. This tilt, which is approximately 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun, is responsible for the varying daylight hours we experience throughout the year. The tilt causes different parts of the Earth to receive varying amounts of sunlight during the course of its orbit, leading to the change in daylight hours and the changing seasons. Here's a breakdown of the answer choices: - Heat energy: While heat energy from the Sun does play a role in Earth's climate, it does not directly determine the amount of daylight Earth gets. - The darkness it gets: The amount of darkness is determined by the absence of daylight, so this is not a direct determinant of the amount of daylight. - The bending of a ray of light: Light bending occurs due to the Earth's atmosphere, but it does not significantly impact the overall amount of daylight the Earth receives. - The tilt of the axis (correct answer): As mentioned earlier, the tilt of Earth's axis is the primary factor influencing the amount of daylight received. - The tilt of the sun's axis: This has no direct impact on the amount of daylight Earth gets. - Electromagnetic energy: While sunlight is a form of electromagnetic energy, this term is broader than just sunlight and does not directly determine the amount of daylight Earth gets. - The brightness of the earth: Earth's brightness or albedo can affect how much solar radiation is absorbed or reflected back into space, but it doesn't determine the amount of daylight. - Rain or sunshine: These are weather conditions and do not determine the amount of daylight Earth receives. In summary, the tilt of the Earth's axis is the main factor that determines the amount of daylight Earth gets. It causes variations in sunlight exposure and leads to changing seasons, with longer days in summer and shorter days in winter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In June 2009, Ray Davies told The Independent that while a full-fledged reunion was unlikely, \\"I will continue to play with ex-band members like Mick Avory from time to time. With Dave, a lot of it is psychological. I'll guide him in, and coerce and nurture him, and when the time is right I suppose I'll even shout at him again.\\" When asked about a possible reunion in an interview that year, Avory stated, \\"A reunion would not be possible with the originals, for a start due to ill health. But it would be possible with the Kast Off Kinks plus Ray. In any event Ray would record new material. We have some old tracks from the 80s as well.\\" In March 2010, Avory reported that the band were planning on releasing an album of unreleased and new material. He stated that they had \\"eight tracks\\" ready for the album, but that the Davies brothers had to settle their differences before the project could progress.Quaife, who had been receiving kidney dialysis for more than ten years, died on 23 June 2010, aged 66. Two days after the bassist's death, Dave Davies posted a statement on his message board expressing deep sorrow over the passing of his former band mate and stating that Quaife \\"was never really given the credit he deserved for his contribution and involvement [sic] [with The Kinks]\\".

Who appeared as Jareth in the film Labyrinth?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \\"God Only Knows\\". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \\"Blue Jean\\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \\"Dancing in the Street\\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \\"This Is Not America\\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \\"Absolute Beginners\\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits \\"Day-In, Day-Out\\" (his 60th single), \\"Time Will Crawl\\", and \\"Never Let Me Down\\". Bowie later described it as his \\"nadir\\", calling it \\"an awful album\\". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although years after the tour's conclusion, critics acknowledged that the tour influenced how other artists performed concerts, including...","output":"The English musician and actor David Bowie appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth. Directed by Jim Henson and produced by George Lucas, the movie was a unique collaboration between these creative talents. In addition to his acting role, Bowie also contributed to the film's soundtrack by writing and performing five songs.  In the 1980s, Bowie was involved in a variety of projects that showcased his diverse interests and talents. Along with film work and music collaborations with other artists such as Tina Turner and Iggy Pop, Bowie released several successful albums like Tonight (1984) and Never Let Me Down (1987).  Although his performance as Jareth in Labyrinth was not his first acting role, it is considered one of his most iconic and memorable parts. Here, Bowie played a powerful and enigmatic character who ruled over a labyrinthine world filled with strange creatures and puzzling challenges. He used his unique voice, commanding presence, and magnetic charisma to bring the character to life, making Jareth both captivating and repellant, as well as undeniably appealing. In terms of Bowie's career, his work on Labyrinth represented a successful fusion of his musical and acting talents. Furthermore, it demonstrated his willingness to branch out into different artistic mediums and genres. Although the film was not a major box office hit upon its release, it achieved cult status over time and continues to resonate with audiences today. Bowie's captivating portrayal of Jareth is a significant reason for Labyrinth's enduring appeal, and the film remains an important part of his artistic legacy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The two-day funeral was planned by Ali in the years before his death, according to a family spokesman. Ali wanted the Muslim prayer service, known as a Jenazah, to be \\"a teaching moment\\", according to Imam Zaid Shakir, who led the service. Muhammad Ali, \\"The Greatest\\", died on Friday aged 74. More than 14,000 people had tickets to the event at the site of Ali's last fight in Louisville in 1961. Obituary: Muhammad Ali The man who changed his sport and country Muhammad Ali - in his own words World pays tribute to boxing legend Ali's love affair with Africa American Muslims attending the service and watching on TV said they hoped that the public prayers would help Americans to become more familiar with Islam and its practices. In 1964, Ali famously converted to Islam, changing his name from Cassius Clay, which he called his \\"slave name\\". He first joined the Nation of Islam, a controversial black separatist movement, before later converting to mainstream Islam. He travelled the world as a boxer and speaker, and inspired Muslims around the world. Abdul Rafay Basheer, 25, travelled from Chicago for the service and said he saw Ali as an ambassador for Muslims. He said the prayer service would help to demystify his religion. That was a theme taken up by Dawud Walid from the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \\"In a political climate in which Islamophobia is front and centre, his funeral will counterpunch the ridiculous notion that being a good Muslim and a good American are at odds,\\" he said. Ali \\"was willing to sacrifice the fame, the lights, the money, the glamour, all of that, for his beliefs and his principles,\\" Imam Shakir said in his address to the packed auditorium after reciting prayers over Ali's coffin. The funeral will continue on Friday with an interfaith memorial service and procession through Louisville passing key locations such as Ali's childhood home, and a museum dedicated to him. Tickets to attend the Friday service ran out only one hour after they became available. World leaders and celebrities will attend, including former US President Bill Clinton and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  President Barack Obama will not be able to attend due to his eldest daughter's graduation on the same day. Speaking after Jenazah prayers, Dr Sherman Jackson, an Islamic scholar, used a boxing term to describe how \\"Ali put the question of whether a person can be a Muslim and an American to rest. Indeed, he KO'ed that question.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"Muhammad Ali was a famous boxer who passed away at 74 years old. Before he died, he planned a special two-day funeral for himself. The first part was a Muslim prayer service called Jenazah. Ali wanted this service to teach people about the Muslim religion. Ali was not always Muslim, but he converted in 1964 and changed his name from Cassius Clay. Many people hope that this special service will help others learn more about Islam and show that someone can be both Muslim and American at the same time. The next day, there will be a big memorial service and a procession through Louisville, where Ali grew up. Some famous people like former US President Bill Clinton will attend the service."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the first sentence, \\"Forward Rob Blake was replaced by defender Patrick Marleau as team captain\\", it states that Rob Blake, who is a forward player, was replaced by Patrick Marleau, who is a defender player, in the position of team captain.

William James, the great psychologist , said that most men are \\"old fogies at twenty-five\\". He was right. Most men at twenty-five are satisfied with their jobs. They have closed their minds to all new ideas; they have stopped to grow. The minute a man stops to grow -no matter what his years -that minute he begins to be old. On the other hand, the really great man never grows old. Goethe passed away at eighty-three, and finished his only a few years earlier; Gladstone took up a new language when he was seventy. Laplace, the astronomer, was still at work when death caught up with him at seventy-eight. He died crying, \\"What we know is nothing; what we do not know is immense (extremely large).\\" And there you have the real answer to the question, \\"When is a man old?\\" Laplace at seventy-eight died young. He was still unsatisfied, still sure that he had a lot to learn. As long as a man can keep himself in that attitude of mind, as long as he can look back on every year and say, \\"I grew\\", he is still young. The minute he ceases (stops) to grow, the minute he says to himself, \\"I know all that I need to know,\\" -that day youth stops. He may be twenty-five or seventy-five; it makes no difference. On that day he begins to be old. Answer the following questions: 1. Who is William James? 2. And what did he say about most men? 3. Is he right? 4. How so? 5. What about those who don't? 6. What did Gladstone do? 7. At what age? 8. How did Laplace feel when he died? 9. Why? 10. Did he believe that we knew anything?","output":"1. William James is a renowned psychologist. 2. He said that most men are \\"old fogies at twenty-five,\\" meaning they have closed their minds to new ideas and stopped growing intellectually. 3. Yes, he is right in the sense that many people tend to become content with their knowledge and stop actively pursuing personal growth at a certain point in their lives, which can be as early as their mid-twenties. 4. This statement alludes to the fact that people often become satisfied with their jobs and current level of knowledge, which leads them to close their minds to new ideas and stop growing intellectually. 5. Those who don't fall into this category continue to learn, grow, and challenge themselves throughout their lives, remaining intellectually and mentally young. 6. Gladstone took up a new language. 7. He did this at the age of seventy. 8. Laplace felt a sense of dissatisfaction and a continued hunger for knowledge when he died. 9. This was because he believed there was still so much more to learn in his field, and he saw his own knowledge as lacking in comparison. 10. While Laplace acknowledged the knowledge he had accumulated, he also understood that it was minimal compared to the vast amount of knowledge still out there. He died with the words, \\"What we know is nothing; what we do not know is immense (extremely large),\\" emphasizing the need for continuous learning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A mobile phone is a mobile phone. But can you combine the two to do something for your local environment? As early as next year it may well be possible. When you have finished with your mobile phone you will be able to bury   it in the garden and wait for it to flower . A biodegradable   mobile phone was, this month, introduced by scientists. It is hoped that the new type of phone will encourage users to recycle. Scientists have come up with a new material over the last five years. It looks like any other plastic and can be hard or soft, and able to change shape. Overtime it can also break down into the soil without giving out any poisonous chemicals. British researchers used the new material to develop a phone cover that includes a sunflower seed .When this new type of cover turns into waste, it forms nitrates  . These feed the seed and help the flower grow. Engineers have designed a small transparent   window to hold the seed. They have made sure it only grows when the phone is thrown away. \\"We've only put sunflower seeds into the cover so far. But we are working with scientists to find out which flowers would perform best. Maybe we could put roses in next time.\\" said one scientist. As phone technology is developing so quickly, people are constantly throwing their mobiles away. This means producers are under pressure to find ways of recycling them. Some 650 million mobile phones have been sold this year. Most of them will be thrown away within two years, adding plastic, heavy metal and chemical waste to the environment. A biodegradable cover can change this, according to the scientists. ,A, B, C, D,. (10) After you have finished using the new type of mobile phone,   _  . A) the phone will do harm to the environment B) the phone cover will break down easily in the soil you bury it C) it will be recycled by the producers D) it can be sent back to the shops. A:","output":"After you have finished using the new type of mobile phone, B) the phone cover will break down easily in the soil you bury it. Reasoning: The passage states that the new biodegradable mobile phone cover is designed to break down into the soil without giving out any poisonous chemicals, and when it turns into waste, it forms nitrates which help feed the seed and help the flower grow. This information aligns with option B, stating that the phone cover will break down easily in the soil when buried, and does not support options A, C, or D."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An effigy of President Barack Obama is burnt by Filipino activists during a rally as a 10-year pact was signed. The presence of foreign troops is a sensitive issue in the Philippines, a former American colony. The Philippine Senate voted in 1991 to close down U.S. bases at Subic and Clark, northwest of Manila. However, it ratified a pact with the United States allowing temporary visits by American forces in 1999, four years after China seized a reef the Philippines contests. Following the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, hundreds of U.S. forces descended in the southern Philippines under that accord to hold counter terrorism exercises with Filipino troops fighting Muslim militants. However this time, the focus of the Philippines and its underfunded military has increasingly turned to external threats as territorial spats with China in the potentially oil and gas-rich South China Sea heated up in recent years.

U.S. Ambassador Philip Goldberg and Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin signed the agreement at the main military camp in the capital, Manila, ahead of Obama's stop and portrayed it is as a central part of his weeklong Asia trip. The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement will give American forces temporary access to selected military camps and allow them to preposition fighter jets and ships. The deal was signed hours before Obama arrived in Manila on the last leg of a four-country Asian tour, following stops in Japan, South Korea and Malaysia. Goldberg said the agreement will 'promote peace and security in the region,' and allow U.S. and Philippine forces to respond faster to disasters and other contingencies. It is not known how many additional U.S. troops would be deployed 'on temporary and rotational basis.'

With. its small military, the Philippines has struggled to bolster its. territorial defense amid China's increasingly assertive behavior in the. disputed South China Sea.

'The Philippines' immediate and urgent motivation is to strengthen itself and look for a security shield with its pitiful military,' Manila-based political analyst Ramon Casiple said. 'The U.S. is looking for a re-entry to Asia, where its superpower status has been put in doubt.' The convergence could work to deter China's increasingly assertive stance in disputed territories, Casiple said. However, it could further antagonise Beijing, which sees such tactical alliance as a U.S. strategy to contain its rise, and encourage China to intensify its massive military buildup, he said. Hundreds of American military personnel have been deployed in the southern Philippines since 2002 to provide counterterrorism training and serve as advisers to Filipino soldiers, who have battled Muslim militants for decades.

The agreement says the U.S. will 'not establish a permanent military presence or base in the Philippines' in compliance with Manila's constitution. A Filipino base commander will have access to areas to be shared with American forces, according to the primer. Disagreements over Philippine access to designated U.S. areas within local camps hampered negotiations for the agreement last year. The agreement will increase coordination between U.S. and Filipino forces, boost the 120,000-strong Philippine military's capability to monitor and secure the country's territory and respond more rapidly to natural disasters and other emergencies.

Chinese paramilitary ships took effective control of the disputed Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing ground off the northwestern Philippines, in 2012. Last year, Chinese coast guard ships surrounded another contested offshore South China Sea territory, the Second Thomas Shoal, where they have been trying to block food supplies and rotation of Filipino marines aboard a grounded Philippine navy ship in the remote coral outcrops.
