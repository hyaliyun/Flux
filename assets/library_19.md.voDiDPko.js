Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? chillingly  Options are:  * negative  * positive","output":"The sentiment of the word \\"chillingly\\" in the given sentence is negative. Now let's examine why this is the case. \\"Chillingly\\" is an adverb that is derived from the adjective \\"chilling,\\" which in turn comes from the verb \\"chill.\\" \\"Chill\\" has several meanings, but in the context of describing a feeling or atmosphere, it usually conveys a sense of coldness, both literally and metaphorically. When something is described as \\"chilling\\" or \\"chillingly,\\" it implies that it causes a feeling of fear, apprehension, or discomfort. In a literal sense, \\"chilling\\" might be used to describe cold weather, a freezing breeze, or a frigid environment. For example, you might say \\"The wind was chilling to the bone\\" when talking about a particularly cold day. In a metaphorical sense, \\"chilling\\" or \\"chillingly\\" is often used to describe a situation, experience, or atmosphere that evokes a feeling of unease, discomfort, or even horror. For instance, you might describe a scary book, movie, or real-life event as \\"chilling\\" if it makes you feel afraid, shocked, or disturbed. Examples of this might include \\"The book had a chillingly realistic portrayal of a dystopian society\\" or \\"The details of the crime were chilling.\\" Given that negative emotions of fear, unease, and discomfort are usually associated with \\"chillingly,\\" it's evident that the sentiment of this word is negative. Please note that without a specific sentence or context, we can only analyze the sentiment of the word \\"chillingly\\" itself. The sentiment of the entire sentence would depend on the surrounding context and the subject matter. However, based on the information provided, the sentiment of the word \\"chillingly\\" is negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Given the background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.  and the situation: David was visiting the natural history museum. He noticed two charts that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two time periods, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's overall climate in the sixteenth century when there were less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And time B showed earth's overall climate in the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. David found some interesting differences between these two charts.  Answer the following question: In which time global temperature would less likey be in equilibrium, time A or time B? The answer is:","output":"Time B would be less likely to have global temperature in equilibrium compared to Time A. This conclusion can be drawn based on the information provided in the background and the situation described. In Time A, which represents the sixteenth century, there were fewer greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. During this period, the concentration of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane was lower than today. This implies that the absorption and trapping of the Earth's infrared radiation by the greenhouse gases would have been less pronounced, allowing more heat to escape back into space, keeping the Earth's temperature relatively stable and closer to a state of equilibrium. However, in Time B, which represents the present century, the situation is different. The levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have significantly increased due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, among others. The higher concentration of these gases leads to a more effective absorption and trapping of the Earth's infrared radiation, resulting in less heat being able to escape back into space. This increased heat trapping disrupts the equilibrium between the incoming solar energy and the outgoing terrestrial energy. Consequently, global temperatures rise, leading to climate change and a host of related consequences such as more frequent extreme weather events, melting ice caps, and rising sea levels, among others. Therefore, Time B, represented by the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, would be less likely to have a global temperature in equilibrium compared to Time A, the sixteenth century when greenhouse gases were comparatively lower in the atmosphere. This divergence from equilibrium highlights the urgent need for actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change on the Earth's ecosystems and human societies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Why did Kenny fall asleep holding George's gun? Movie title: A Single Man Movie plot: Taking place over the course of a single day, November 30, 1962, a month after the Cuban missile crisis, A Single Man is the story of George Falconer (Colin Firth), a middle-aged English college professor living in Los Angeles. George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode), at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening. George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley (Julianne Moore), who projects lightheartedness despite her being equally miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. Throughout, there are flashbacks to George and Jim's sixteen-year-long relationship. During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter (Nicholas Hoult), who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos (Jon Kortajarena). That evening George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim angers George. George goes to a bar and discovers that Kenny has followed him. They get a round of drinks, go skinny dipping, and then return to George's house and continue drinking. George passes out and wakes up alone in bed with Kenny asleep in another room. George gets up and while watching Kenny discovers that he had fallen asleep holding George's gun, taken from the desktop, to keep George from committing suicide. George locks the gun away, burns his suicide notes and in a closing voiceover explains how he has rediscovered the ability \\"to feel, rather than think\\". As he... Answer:","output":"Kenny fell asleep holding George's gun because he discovered George's intention to commit suicide. Throughout the movie, Kenny has shown interest in George and has overstepped the conventional boundaries of their student-professor relationship, symbolising a closeness, concern or need to protect George. After their night together, Kenny found George's gun on the desktop and took it, falling asleep with it in his possession. His likely intent was to ensure George couldn't access it in his depressive and suicidal state. This action by Kenny seems to convey his care for George's well-being and his wish to prevent George from ending his life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In a technologically-advanced 1939, the zeppelin Hindenburg III moors itself atop the Empire State Building. Aboard the airship is Dr. Jorge Vargas, a scientist who arranges for a package containing two vials to be delivered to Dr. Walter Jennings. The courier looks back while leaving with the vials, to see that Dr. Vargas has vanished. Polly Perkins, a reporter for The Chronicle, is looking into the disappearances of Vargas and five other renowned scientists. A cryptic message leads her to Radio City Music Hall, against the warnings of her editor, Mr. Paley, where she meets Dr. Jennings during a showing of The Wizard of Oz. He tells her that a Dr. Totenkopf is coming for him next. Suddenly, seemingly indestructible robots attack the city. Clearly outmatched, the authorities call for \\"Sky Captain\\" Joe Sullivan, the city's hero and Perkins' ex-lover and the commander of the private air force the Flying Legion. While Joe engages the robots with his modified Curtiss P-40 pursuit fighter, Perkins photographs from the street with little regard for her personal safety.

Chinese people \\"cross roads without thinking about traffic lights, so long as they are part of a crowd\\", said a post on Sina Weibo. A CCTV news program showed that in only an hour, more than 600 people ran red lights when crossing a road in Shijiazhuang, Hebei. Many people say that they jaywalk   because the red light lasts too long. Such an opinion is supported by a research team at Tongji University. The team did research on people's waiting times at different road crossings from 2008 to 2010. They found that Chinese people would wait for 70 to 90 seconds before they lost their patience. \\"People are likely to run the red light when the waiting time is longer than they can bear  ,\\"said Ni Ying, a member of the research team. However, a survey on Sina Weibo shows that nearly half of respondents   believe that people jaywalk mainly because they disregard   rules. \\"I always obey  traffic rules.

The answer is:","output":"The missing first step of the given process of fossil formation is: 1. Organism dies and becomes buried in sediment. To provide a comprehensive understanding, below is the entire process, including the missing first step and the provided steps, with detailed explanations: 1. Organism dies and becomes buried in sediment: This is the initial crucial stage of fossilization. When an organism dies, it can either decompose entirely or be preserved, leading to the possibility of fossil formation. For fossilization to occur, rapid burial in sediment is necessary, such as in environments like riverbanks, ocean floors, or lake beds. The sediment protects the remains from oxygen and other decomposers, thereby slowing down the decay process. 2. Water seeps into the remains: Following the burial, water that is rich in dissolved minerals and ions starts to seep into the remains of the organism. This groundwater permeates the porous spaces of the bones, shells, or other hard parts of the organism's remains. 3. Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals: As the mineral-rich water seeps into the organism's remains, the dissolved minerals gradually start to precipitate and form crystals within the gaps or empty spaces of the remains. This crystallization process is called permineralization. Common minerals that are involved in this process include quartz, calcite, and pyrite. 4. Crystallized minerals cause the remains to harden: Over time, the minerals in the form of crystals continue to accumulate and eventually replace the organic material of the remains. As more and more minerals infiltrate the remains, the process of petrification takes place, wherein the original structure of the organism's remains hardens due to the presence of the mineral crystals, preserving the original shape and form of the organism. 5. The minerals form a fossil: After the entire fossilization process has taken place, and all the organic material has been replaced by minerals, a fossil is formed. The hardened remains now serve as a permanent record of the organism's existence in the geologic past, providing valuable information about its morphology and history in the evolutionary timeline. This entire process can take thousands to millions of years, depending on the geological conditions and type of organism that is being fossilized. Through the study of fossils, scientists can better understand the Earth's history and the evolution of various species over time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices:  - kaleidoscope  - rainbow  - spots  - spectrum  A: Answer:","output":"A: If you look at a star through a prism, you will see a spectrum.  When light passes through a prism, it is refracted or bent, which causes the various wavelengths of light to spread out and display a range of colors. This is known as dispersion. A star, like our Sun, emits light across a wide range of wavelengths, including visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation. When the starlight passes through a prism, these wavelengths are further separated, creating a spectrum. The spectrum you would observe from looking at a star through a prism is composed of a series of colors, typically spanning from red to violet, which is the range of visible light. These colors represent the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the star at different energies. Each color corresponds to a specific wavelength, and the distribution of colors will depend on the star's temperature, composition, and other factors. This visible spectrum is often referred to as a continuous spectrum because it consists of a continuous range of colors without any gaps. However, the star spectrum might also exhibit dark lines or bands known as absorption lines, which are the result of certain elements present in the star's outer layers absorbing specific wavelengths of light. These dark lines are key to understanding the chemical composition of a star, as each element creates a unique pattern of absorption lines. For instance, the presence of hydrogen in a star absorbs light at specific wavelengths, leading to the formation of hydrogen lines or the Balmer series in the visible spectrum. Analyzing these spectral lines allows astronomers to determine the chemical makeup of a star, its temperature, and other physical properties. To sum up, when you look at a star through a prism, you will see a spectrum rather than a kaleidoscope, rainbow, or spots. This spectrum is a representation of the star's emitted light, which is dispersed by the prism into its various wavelengths. Studying this spectrum gives astronomers valuable information about the properties and elements present in the star."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Step 3: Ensure the number is preserved - There are no specific numbers in the Hindi sentence to be preserved in the English translation. Step 4: Assess the translation's overall quality and correctness - The English translation captures the meaning of the original Hindi sentence.

These are virtually still images revealing the key elements of the film: Justine (Kirsten Dunst) the bride in deep melancholy with birds falling behind her; of a lawn with trees and a sundial with two different shadows; Pieter Breughel's Hunters in the Snow (often used as interpretation of an idealised nostalgia) the non existent 19th hole (limbo) and the Black Horse collapsing catastrophically in slow motion (id/ego battle); Justine as a bride being swept along by a river; and her being held back by her wedding dress; and finally Justine and her nephew building their magic cave before the earth crashes into Melancholia becoming one. The film continues in two parts.Part One: \\"Justine\\" is of an ideal and perfect wedding that sweeps bride Justine along and which clashes with Justines fragile world.This act begins with an clumsy, oversized wedding vehicle unable to negotiate a curve in the road.Newlyweds Justine and Michael (Alexander Skarsgård) arrive two hours late to their own reception at the family estate where Justine's sister Claire and her husband John reside. Justine happens to notice a particularly bright red star in the twilight sky which John identifies as Antares.During the course of the wedding we realise that each of the characters represent a metaphor. These metaphors are developed during the night of the wedding reception. Her brother-in-law, John, represents sacrifice (cost of the wedding) and social conformity. Her dad is hedonistic and selfish therefore unable to connect at a meaningful level with Justine. Her mother ,Gaby (honesty) is brutally; ruthlessly and pathologically honest which gets her thrown out of the wedding. However Justines sister ,Claire, who represents order urges Justine to dishonestly hide her debilitating melancholy from her bland, gormless, doting husband, Michael, (This is highlighted by his wedding speech) and anyway...

One day in a trial a new-hatched defence attorney tried to make me seem neglectful because I hadn't sent the prints from the crime scene to the FBI for verification. The FBI will not look at prints that have already been identified locally. I tried to get that across to him. Finally I said, “Sir, you don't understand. I don't ask the FBI for help. The FBI asks me for help.” The courtroom went dead silent. The lawyer choked a bit and looked frantically at the judge, who knew me quite well. The judge slowly nodded. The lawyer choked a few more times, said, “No further questions,” and returned to his seat. I was the only person in the five-state area in which the silver burglar was hitting who got him on fingerprint evidence. He never left fingerprint evidence . . . except when he did. Every other police agency quit looking, because his MO was unmistakable. We didn't. A detective got prints from a bamboo tree he had used to climb in a window, and I got several prints from items he had handled inside the house.

Scene: Witnesses say 22-year-old mother got out of her car and stopped in the middle of Simontown Road in Pemberton Township, New Jersey, on Friday night and burned the child alive. 'It was just mind-boggling. It was a nightmare even if you have a strong heart. Hopefully she'll pay for it,' said Joseph. Dorvilier was arrested at the scene.

Article: Cartoon Network’s satirical, smart Rick and Morty is huge among millennials, but an attempt by fast-food giant McDonald’s to capitalize on one of the show’s running gags appears to be backfiring.      The backstory here is appropriately absurd. Rick and Morty, co-created by Community mastermind Dan Harmon, chronicles the adventures of an alcoholic superscientist and his mostly inept grandson, mixing absurd catchphrases, fantastic alien worlds, and extremely sharp storytelling into a cocktail that’s ripe for the internet age. One of the show’s gags had Rick obsessively questing for McDonald’s Szechuan nugget sauce, a promotional flavor briefly offered in conjunction with the Disney film Mulan 20 years ago.      The show’s cultish fanbase responded en masse, starting a petition to bring back the sauce and talking it up endlessly online. McDonald’s execs hinted they might do just that, and made it official this week, saying the sauce would be available for just one day – today, October 7th – as part of a promotion for the chain’s new Buttermilk Crispy Tenders.      Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.      But there are signs that the promotion is going south, with fans and news outlets reporting that supplies of the ironically prized sauce are running out almost instantly at the select locations where it was supposed to be available. On Twitter, some customers are claiming stores reported receiving only 20 cups of the prized sauce. Other customers are claiming stores haven’t received promised supplies at all.      Though the fast-food chain was clear that supplies would be limited, fans on social media are nonetheless extremely frustrated with the situation.      . @McDonalds I’m at the Merrimack,NH location for the Szechuan Sauce!

McDonald’s has acknowledged customers’ frustration, but without offering any real remedy. Fortune has reached out for further comment.      The best fans in the multiverse showed us what they got today. We hear you & we're sorry not everyone could get some super-limited Szechuan. — McDonald's (@McDonalds) October 7, 2017      A relaunch of an old McDonald’s nugget sauce might not seem like a big deal to most people, but this could turn into something serious for McDonald’s. Fans of Rick and Morty are passionate, and some mimic the show’s more acerbic elements by displaying a mean streak so broad it has included harassing the show’s own female writers. Mix that with internet savvy and a target as big as the Golden Arches, and you’ve got a recipe for spicy disaster. ||||| “I want that Mulan McNugget sauce, Morty,” says Rick at the end of season premiere. “That’s my series arc, Morty! If it takes nine seasons!”      So last week, after fans petitioned and pressured the chain, McDonald’s finally gave in. Unfortunately the event was mostly a letdown, and “Rick and Morty” fans let everyone know how angry they were on Twitter. ||||| McDonald's is receiving major backlash after a failed attempt at bringing back a cult-favorite sauce.      As previously reported, McDonald’s had agreed to bring back the discontinued Szechuan sauce following pleas from Cartoon Network’s adult cartoon, “Rick and Morty.”      McDonald’s announced last week that for one-day only, the fast food restaurant would carry the Szechuan sauce for customers at participating locations.      BURGER KING ITEM HITS GROCERY STORES      That one day – Saturday, October 7 – “Rick and Morty” and Szechuan sauce fans gathered outside McDonald’s restaurants nationwide. Thousands lined up hours before the packets were allowed to be sold, all clamoring for the sweet plum sauce.      However, McDonald’s failed to mention in any of their widespread promos that only 20 packets of the highly anticipated sauce would be available at the stores. The Huffington Post reported that some locations listed online as participating stores didn’t actually have the sauce packets at all or some had sold out before the authorized selling time.      Once the fans realized that the sauce had been sold out after waiting in line for hours, they were outraged. So much so that the police had to be called to disband an angry crowd surrounding a Wellington, Fl. McDonald’s.      At another McDonald’s, a mob chanting, “we want sauce,” formed, and the police had to push them back.      Other locations, adults left angry and kids left crying.      The disgruntled customers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations at the chain, claiming false advertising and calling for both a “class action lawsuit” and a “boycott.” The latter became a trending hashtag for the day, #boycottMcDonalds.      FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS      McDonald’s responded to the outrage, issuing a public apology on their Twitter account.      “The best fans in the multiverse showed us what they got today,” McDonald’s tweeted. “We hear you & we’re sorry not everyone could get some super-limited Szechuan.”      Fans weren’t buying it, and accused the hamburger joint of just wanting the publicity.      The fast-food giant later released a second apology on Facebook, and promised that there would be more sauce on the horizon.      \\"...Our super limited batch, though well-intentioned, clearly wasn't enough to meet that demand,\\" reads the statement. \\"...So, we are going to make this right. ... Szechuan Sauce is coming back again this winter.\\" ||||| Image copyright Twitter Image caption McDonalds sent the out-of production sauce to the show's creators before announcing its return      A McDonald's PR stunt to bring back a rare dipping sauce left thousands of fans disappointed, with police called to some US restaurants on Saturday.      The Szechuan sauce, which was only made in 1998 to promote the film Mulan, has become well known after featuring in the popular cartoon Rick and Morty.      In July the chain sent a large bottle of the sauce to the show's creators.      They then announced it would come back for one day on 7 October, but fans were left disappointed after stores ran out.      In one video, police can be seen holding back people chanting \\"we want sauce\\".      Officers also attended other stores because hundreds of people turned up.      The sauce became a meme among fans of the adult animated science-fiction series after it was featured in the third series.      McDonald's announced the Szechuan's return last week, describing it as a \\"really, really limited release\\" to special locations in the US.      But fans online said some restaurants claimed they were only given 20 pots of the sauce per venue, while others received none.      Fans took to social media to vent their frustrations after being unable to get their hands on the out-of-production dip.      One couple posted that they had driven for four hours to a restaurant stocking the sauce, but were left disappointed.      The global fast food chain apologised to fans on social media but repeated their warning that the release was going to be \\"super limited\\".      Pots of the sauce are now listed for sale on online auction websites for hundreds of dollars.      Angry customers posted pictures of breaded chicken and dipping sauces from other fast-food chains in protest at the stunt.      Others posted pictures of large bowls of the sauce they had made for themselves at home. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

McDonald's had promised to distribute the sauce, which was first made in 1998 and was referenced in an episode of the show, on 7 October at specific locations in the US. Fans complained that some stores only received 20 pots of the sauce while others did not have any at all. McDonald’s later used social media to tell fans that it was sorry for the incident and that the sauce would return in a larger quantity this winter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Estonian language When Estonia was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union in World War II, the status of the Estonian language changed to the first of two official languages (Russian being the other one). As with Latvia many immigrants entered Estonia under Soviet encouragement. In the second half of the 1970s, the pressure of bilingualism (for Estonians) intensified, resulting in widespread knowledge of Russian throughout the country. The Russian language was termed as ‘the language of friendship of nations’ and was taught to Estonian children, sometimes as early as in kindergarten. Although teaching Estonian to non-Estonians in schools was compulsory, in practice learning the language was often considered unnecessary.

Article:The Foxes, who are now level on points with leaders Arsenal, looked like they were heading for a fourth league game without a goal until unmarked Huth headed home Christian Fuchs' corner. Harry Kane had Spurs' best chance when his effort was touched on to the bar by keeper Kasper Schmeichel. Foxes striker Jamie Vardy returned from groin surgery but had a quiet game. It was the second of three meetings between the clubs in 10 days, following Sunday's 2-2 FA Cup draw - with their replay to be shown on BBC One, next Wednesday. Relive Leicester's win over Tottenham. Listen: 'Leicester would be devastated not to make Champions League now' Football Daily podcast - Does anyone want to win the league? Media playback is not supported on this device There had been fears Leicester's slide was beginning after three games without scoring - and they looked like making that four in a row before Huth's late goal. But this win - which takes them seven points above fourth-placed Spurs and eight clear of West Ham in fifth - will give them real hope of finishing in the Champions League places, if not higher. They were characteristically short of possession with only 39% - their average of 40.62% is the third lowest in the league - but they have shown they are far from a two-man team with Riyad Mahrez and Vardy, their two stars of the campaign, subdued throughout. Maybe, but it was wasteful finishing rather than the lack of a second striker that cost Spurs against the Foxes. Manager Mauricio Pochettino has continually insisted it is not urgent they sign a new striker to partner Kane, who is their top scorer with 11 league goals. The England international was their sole striker against Leicester but Spurs' formation meant Erik Lamela, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli got forward to support him regularly. Those four had a combined 18 shots, although Kane's effort which Schmeichel touched on to the bar was one of only five shots on target the team managed. Former England captain Alan Shearer on Match of the Day: \\"It's a remarkable story for Leicester. Only Manchester City have scored more goals than them. \\"It was a good old-fashioned proper plant your feet, arch your back and get your neck muscles going header from Huth. Look at the power. Boof.\\" Ex-Germany midfielder Dietmar Hamann: \\"It's a blip for Spurs. They're still in a good position and favourites to reach the Champions League. The worry is the lack of form from Christian Eriksen, who hasn't scored in the league since October. They are over-reliant on Harry Kane. If he gets injured they'll be in trouble.\\" Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri told BBC Match of the Day: \\"We wanted to win but we knew it was a difficult match. Tottenham started very well and put us under pressure but we didn't lose our confidence or shape and it was difficult for them. \\"In the second half it was an open match. We both had chances and we scored the goal. Unfortunately it's January, not May. There's so much work to do. We have to remain calm and believe in what we're doing.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino: \\"I'm disappointed. We created the better chances. You need to score. We need to keep calm and try to improve. \\"All the stats are positive for us. It's difficult to explain - we deserved more and to win the game.

Solve -10*r + 629 = 326 + 343 for r.","output":"To solve the equation -10*r + 629 = 326 + 343 for r, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify both sides of the equation On the left side of the equation, we have -10*r + 629. On the right side of the equation, we can simplify the expression 326 + 343 by summing those numbers: 326 + 343 = 669 So, the equation now looks like this: -10*r + 629 = 669 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable (r) Now, we want to isolate the term with the variable r on one side of the equation.  To do this, let's subtract 629 from both sides of the equation: -10*r + 629 - 629 = 669 - 629 This simplifies to: -10*r = 40 Step 3: Solve for the variable (r) Now we have an equation with just one term containing the variable r. To solve for r, we simply need to divide both sides of the equation by -10: (-10*r) / -10 = 40 / -10 This simplifies to: r = -4 So, the solution to the equation -10*r + 629 = 326 + 343 for r is: r = -4"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: -  Acid rain leaches aluminum from clay particles in soil - Aluminum flows into streams and lakes - Acid rain dissolves minerals and nutrients in soil - Washes them away so plants can&#x27;t benefit from them - PH in soil and water gets affected which can kill plants and animals  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process could be the disruption of entire ecosystems, biodiversity loss, and adverse impact on human activities and well-being.  When the pH in the soil and water is altered due to acid rain, it can have fatal consequences for plants and aquatic organisms. This imbalance in pH levels affects the overall health of these living organisms, making them more susceptible to diseases, limiting their growth, and potentially causing their demise. As a result, there is a decline in the populations of affected species, leading to an imbalance in the food chain. The food chain is an interconnected web of organisms, where each species relies on another for sustenance. The disruption of one species can have further reaching implications on other dependent species, leading to a cascade effect that negatively impacts the entire ecosystem. The loss of biodiversity can lead to reduced ecosystem resilience, as fewer species are available to perform essential roles such as pollination, regulation of pests, and nutrient cycling. The impacts of acid rain are not limited to natural ecosystems but can extend to human activities as well. The leaching of essential minerals and nutrients from the soil can reduce agricultural productivity, leading to decreased crop yields and food supply. This can have detrimental social and economic consequences, particularly for communities that heavily rely on agriculture as their primary source of income and sustenance. Furthermore, the contamination of freshwater resources due to the influx of aluminum and other pollutants can result in the deterioration of water quality. This can make the water unsafe for human consumption, posing health risks and necessitating expensive water treatment processes. Moreover, it can impact other human activities such as industries, power generation, and recreational activities, all of which rely on clean water. In conclusion, the last step of the process initiated by acid rain leaching aluminum from clay particles in the soil can be the disruption of entire ecosystems, biodiversity loss, and adverse impact on human activities and well-being. To mitigate these effects and preserve the balance of our natural environment, it is crucial to address the primary sources of acid rain, such as the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants, industries, and transportation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Jewish community had challenged the ban, introduced in 2013, saying that it was discriminatory. The Constitutional Court had previously ruled that it was against Polish law to allow animals to be killed without first being stunned. But to produce kosher and halal meat, animals must be uninjured before death. The ban had been challenged by the Union of Jewish Religious Communities on the grounds that it impacted on their constitutional right to practise their religion and prevented minority communities from following their traditions. The court ruled that the ritual slaughter of animals should be allowed on the grounds of religious freedom. The ritual slaughter of animals had been practised in Poland for centuries by both Jews and Muslims, the court's judge said. Under Jewish and Islamic law, animals must be healthy and uninjured at the time of death, which usually rules out normal stunning methods that involve electrocution or shooting the animal with a metal bolt. Animals are traditionally slaughtered with a single, rapid cut to the throat in Muslim and Jewish communities. Before the ban, Poland had been a major exporter of kosher and halal meat and poultry to the Middle East. The reversal of the ban also allows for a resumption of exports, Jewish leaders say. Animal rights groups had welcomed the ban, saying the practice caused animals unnecessary suffering. Israel, however, criticised it, noting that the Nazis had done the same thing during their occupation of Poland during World War Two.

A:","output":"Given the two facts provided, the soil and mud changed by extreme heat and pressure over long periods of time can be identified as the formation of peat in bogs. Fact 1 mentions that being buried under soil and mud changes vegetation into peat through extreme heat and pressure in a swamp over an extended period of time. This process involves the accumulation of dead plant material, particularly in wetland ecosystems, and the transformation of this material into peat due to anaerobic conditions, pressure, and high temperatures. Fact 2 states that bogs are characterized by cushion-like vegetation and an accumulation of peat. Bogs are a specific type of wetland ecosystem, formed in areas with low nutrient availability and acidic-water content, generating a unique vegetation composition. The saturated conditions, coupled with relatively low oxygen levels, result in slow decomposition of dead plant material, leading to the gradual buildup of peat.

Q:Given the following context:  Metallica opted for extensive touring instead of releasing a single or video to promote the album. Metallica spent March to August 1986 touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath, which Osbourne perceived as a mockery toward him. Referring to that occasion, Ulrich stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for its excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname \\"Alcoholica\\". The band members occasionally wore satirical T-shirts reading \\"Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All\\". The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore.

Title: The Amazing Mr Blunden Movie plot: The film begins in 1918,[2] where a war widow, Mrs. Allen (Dorothy Alison) and her children, Lucy (Lynne Frederick), Jamie (Garry Miller) and baby Benjamin are reduced to living in a squalid, Camden Town flat. Just before Christmas, a mysterious old man, Mr. Frederick Percival Blunden (Laurence Naismith) visits the family, introducing himself as a representative of a firm of solicitors.[2] The family are told there is an opportunity to become the caretakers of a derelict country mansion in the Home Counties named Langley Park, which was gutted by fire years before, and is now in the charge of the solicitors. Mrs. Allen takes the post despite rumours that the house is haunted, her instructions to care for the property until such time as the heirs to the estate can be traced. The air of mystery deepens when the children see a portrait at the solicitors office of a man they believe to be Mr Blunden. The solicitor confirms this, but reveals that the portrait is of a man called Mr Blunden, but who has been dead for a hundred years.[6] After they have settled into the new post, Lucy and Jamie see two ghostly figures in the grounds of the house: a teenage girl, Sara Latimer (Rosalyn Landor), and her younger brother, Georgie (Marc Granger). They are two children who lived in the house a century earlier.[7] Sara tells them that she and her brother are orphans, under the care of their dissolute and hapless Uncle Bertie (James Villiers) and the solicitor Mr. Blunden, until Georgie comes of age. Bertie marries a music hall performer, Bella Wickens[8] and her parents then move into Langley Park, ostensibly as the housekeeper and game keeper.[8] The children come to suspect that Mrs. Wickens (Diana Dors) and her disturbed (and often violent) husband are plotting to kill them to get hold of Georgie's inheritance.

Today, we are going to talk about some big changes that are happening for firefighters in a place called Greater Manchester.

A group of people called a \\"union\\" is saying that all the firefighters in Greater Manchester are going to lose their jobs. That sounds sad, right? But don't worry! They can get their jobs back. How can they do that? Well, they have to agree to work a new schedule called a 12-hour shift rota. Now, let's talk about what this 12-hour shift rota means. It's a new way for firefighters to plan their work hours. Right now, firefighters work for a certain number of hours and then have some time off. With the new plan, they would work for 12 hours and then have the rest of the day off. Why are these changes happening? The people in charge think that this new schedule will help firefighters do their jobs better and keep people in Greater Manchester safer. The union, however, is not sure about this change and they want to talk to the people in charge to make sure it's a good idea. So, kids, that's what's happening to the firefighters in Greater Manchester.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process is when the star, specifically a red giant, begins to run out of fuel in its core. Due to the lack of fuel, the star cannot generate enough energy through nuclear fusion to maintain a balance against the force of gravity, which is constantly trying to compress the star. The core's decreased mass and increased gravitational pressure trigger hydrogen fusion in a shell outside the core, and this causes the star's outer layers to expand and heat up. The increase in temperature leads to a higher core temperature, setting the stage for the subsequent steps in the evolution of the star ultimately resulting in the formation of a white dwarf."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who does Catherine start a relationship with? Movie title: Jules and Jim Movie plot: The film is set before, during and after the Great War in several different parts of France, Austria, and Germany. Jules (Oskar Werner) is a shy writer from Austria who forges a friendship with the more extroverted Frenchman Jim (Henri Serre). They share an interest in the world of the arts and the Bohemian lifestyle. At a slide show, they become entranced with a bust of a goddess and her serene smile, and travel to see the ancient statue on an island in the Adriatic Sea. After encounters with several women, they meet the free-spirited, capricious Catherine (Jeanne Moreau), a doppelgÃ¤nger for the statue with the serene smile. The three hang out together. Although she begins a relationship with Jules, both men are affected by her presence and her attitude toward life. Jim continues to be involved with Gilberte, usually seeing her apart from the others. A few days before war is declared, Jules and Catherine move to Austria to get married. Both men serve during the war, on the opposing sides; each fears throughout the conflict the potential for facing the other or learning that he might have killed his friend. After the wartime separation, Jim visits, and later stays with, Jules and Catherine in their house in the Black Forest. Jules and Catherine by then have a young daughter, Sabine. Jules confides the tensions in their marriage. He tells Jim that Catherine torments and punishes him at times with numerous affairs, and she once left him and Sabine for six months. She flirts with and attempts to seduce Jim, who has never forgotten her. Jules, desperate that Catherine might leave him forever, gives his blessing for Jim to marry Catherine so that he may continue to visit them and see her.

Is the following review positive or negative? I expected better for the price.","output":"The given statement \\"I expected better for the price\\" appears to be a negative review. It seems that the reviewer had some expectations and anticipated a higher quality, better value, or superior service, given the price they paid. However, it implies that the product or service did not meet these expectations, leaving the reviewer disappointed and possibly dissatisfied. The negative sentiment in this review is primarily driven by the word \\"better,\\" which in this case highlights the discrepancy between what was expected and what was actually received. Moreover, the mention of \\"price\\" implies that the expense might have been a major factor in the formation of these expectations, as higher-priced items or services often come with the assumption of superior quality, performance, or convenience. Additionally, the use of a comparison term \\"better\\" suggests that the reviewer might have previous experiences or knowledge regarding similar products or services. The fact that they are comparing the quality to their prior expectations or experiences further emphasizes the dissatisfaction expressed in their statement. While the review is not overly critical or scathing, it does give other potential buyers or clients an indication that they might want to reconsider or look for alternatives before investing their money into this particular product or service. The reviewer does not provide specific details, which could be beneficial in understanding the exact reasons for their disappointment, yet the overall sentiment of the review is clearly negative. It may encourage the company to consider revising their product, service, or pricing structure to improve future customer satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Two coastal communities  on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to  bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment.  Which village was less thoughtful about the environment? Answer:","output":"The village of Forx was less thoughtful about the environment in comparison to Davin village. While both communities aimed to bring more money into the local economy, they adopted different approaches that had contrasting impacts on the environment. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, which are traditional and sustainable economic activities that usually have minimal impacts on the environment when practiced responsibly and with proper management systems in place. For example, maintaining appropriate fishing limits helps maintain fish populations, and utilizing eco-friendly agricultural practices supports soil health and reduces water pollution from nutrient run-off. In contrast, the village of Forx opted to mine sand from the nearby dunes, which they found to be very profitable. However, they did not consider the potential environmental consequences of their actions. Sand mining, particularly when carried out irresponsibly and without proper environmental safeguards, can cause significant environmental problems such as: 1. Disruption of local ecosystems: Sand mining can lead to the loss of habitat for various plant and animal species, reducing biodiversity and damaging ecosystems that play vital roles in maintaining environmental balance. 2. Soil erosion and sedimentation: Mining sand can cause the removal of the protective topsoil layer, which can lead to increased erosion and sedimentation in nearby water bodies. As a result, water quality declines, and the sediment can smother aquatic life, leading to long-term changes in the composition and structure of these ecosystems. 3. Groundwater depletion: Extensive sand mining can lead to the depletion of local groundwater resources, particularly when it lowers the water table. This can, in turn, affect the availability of water for human consumption, agriculture, and other uses. 4. Coastal changes: The removal of sand from dunes can lead to changes in the coastal landscape, increasing susceptibility to erosion, flooding, and storm surges. These changes can have adverse consequences not only for the environment but also for local economies, infrastructure, and the safety of the residents. Considering the outlined environmental consequences of sand mining and the more sustainable approach taken by Davin village through commercial fishing and agriculture, it becomes clear that the village of Forx was less thoughtful about the environment in their pursuit of economic growth. If Forx had considered the long-term consequences and externalities of their actions, they might have implemented more eco-friendly strategies or regulations to minimize the negative impacts of their sand mining activities. Therefore, this case highlights the importance of considering not only economic gains but also the environmental consequences when making decisions for the development of local economies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Maelgwn Gwynedd (Latin: Maglocunus; died c. 547) was king of Gwynedd during the early 6th century. Surviving records suggest he held a pre-eminent position among the Brythonic kings in Wales and their allies in the \\"Old North\\" along the Scottish coast. Maelgwn was a generous supporter of Christianity, funding the foundation of churches throughout Wales and even far beyond the bounds of his own kingdom. Nonetheless, his principal legacy today is the scathing account of his behavior recorded in De excidio In his work On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain written c. 540, Gildas makes an allegorical condemnation of 5 British kings by likening them to the beasts of the Book of Revelation, 13-2: the lion, leopard, bear, and dragon, with the dragon supreme among them. He says that Maelgwn is the \\"dragon of the island\\", and goes on with a litany of moral accusations, in the process describing him almost as a regional high king over the other kings (the power-giving dragon of the Apocalypse). The Isle of Anglesey was the base of power of the kings of Gwynedd, so describing Maelgwn as the \\"dragon of the island\\" is appropriate.  Gildas restricts his attention to the kings of Gwynedd (Maelgwn), Dyfed (Vortiporius), Penllyn (probable, as its king Cuneglasus/Cynlas appears in royal genealogies associated with the region), Damnonia/Alt Clud (Constantine), and the unknown region associated with Caninus. The Welsh kingdoms are all associated with the conquest of the Gaels by Cunedda, while Alt Clud had a long and ongoing relationship with Gwynedd and its kings.  In the course of his condemnations, Gildas makes passing reference to the other beasts mentioned in the Apocalypse, such as the eagle, serpent, calf, and wolf. The reason for Gildas' disaffection for these individuals is unknown. He was selective in his choice of kings, as he had no comments concerning the kings of the other British kingdoms that were thriving at the time, such as Rheged, Gododdin, Elmet, Pengwern/Powys, or the kingdoms of modern-day southern England. That he chose only the kings associated with one king's pre-eminence (Maelgwn, the \\"dragon\\") suggests a reason other than his claim of moral outrage over personal depravity. Neither outrage nor a doctrinal dispute would seem to justify beginning the condemnation of the five kings with a personal attack against the mother of one of the kings, calling her an \\"unclean lioness\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What suggests this?","output":"Maelgwn Gwynedd was a king in Wales a long, long time ago, around the early 6th century. He was very important and helped other kings in nearby areas. He also really liked the Christian religion and gave a lot of money to build churches. A man named Gildas wrote a book, and in the book, he compared Maelgwn to a dragon from a story in the Bible. Gildas said Maelgwn was the strongest and most important king, like the dragon. He also talked about other kings, but he didn't like some of them and said mean things about their families. This helps us understand that Maelgwn was an important king and that Gildas thought he was powerful, like a dragon in a storybook."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: The Hunchback of Notre Dame Movie plot: Quasimodo being offered water by Esmeralda. The story is set in Paris in 1482. Quasimodo is a deaf, half-blind, hunchbacked bell-ringer of the famous Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. His master Jehan, the evil brother of Notre Dame's saintly archdeacon Don Claudio, prevails upon the hunchback to kidnap the fair Esmeralda, a dancing gypsy girl (and the adopted daughter of Clopin, the king of the oppressed beggars of Paris' underworld). The dashing Captain Phoebus rescues Esmeralda from Quasimodo, while Jehan abandons him and flees. At first seeking a casual romance, Phoebus becomes entranced by Esmeralda, and takes her under his wing. Quasimodo is sentenced to be lashed in the public square. After being whipped, he begs for water. Esmeralda pities him, and brings him some. To their dismay, Jehan and Clopin both learn that Phoebus hopes to marry Esmeralda, despite being engaged to Fleur de Lys. Phoebus persuades Esmeralda to accompany him to a ball celebrating his appointment as Captain of the Guard by King Louis XI. He provides her with rich garments and introduces her to their hostess, Madame de Gondelaurier, as a Princess of Egypt. Clopin, accompanied by his beggars, crashes the festivities and demands Esmeralda be returned. To avoid bloodshed, Esmeralda says that she does not belong with the aristocracy. Later, however, Esmeralda sends the street poet Pierre Gringoire to give Phoebus a note, arranging a rendezvous at Notre Dame to say goodbye to him. Before Phoebus arrives, he is stabbed in the back by Jehan. After Esmeralda is falsely sentenced to death for the crime, she is rescued from the gallows by Quasimodo and carried inside the cathedral, where he and Don Claudio grants her sanctuary.     Don Claudio restrains Quasimodo from violence. Later that night, Clopin leads the whole of the underworld to storm the cathedral, and Jehan attempts to take Esmeralda, first by guile (telling her that Phoebus's dying wish was for him to take care of her), then by force. Quasimodo holds off the invaders with rocks... Answer:","output":"Quasimodo helped Esmeralda to escape.

The undershirt makes the baby look bigger and not the shirt because the  Available choices:  (1). undershirt is thick.;  (2). shirt is thick.;","output":"The undershirt makes the baby look bigger and not the shirt because the undershirt is thick. To understand why this is the case, let's explore the significant role undershirts play in a baby's wardrobe and how the thickness of the undershirt can affect the appearance of the baby when worn under a shirt. Undershirts, also known as vests or singlets, are the innermost layers of clothing worn by babies, providing comfort, warmth, and protection. They serve as the barrier between their sensitive skin and any possible irritants, such as zippers or buttons from their outer clothes like shirts, rompers, or dresses. Moreover, they absorb any excess sweat, preventing moisture from coming into contact with the baby's delicate skin. Babies can wear undershirts made of varying thickness, depending on factors such as the weather, the baby's activity level, and personal preference. A thicker undershirt provides additional warmth and insulation, making it suitable for colder climates, winter months, or babies who tend to feel cold easily. On the other hand, when a baby wears a thick undershirt under a shirt, it creates a fuller and bulkier appearance. This is because the thick material adds extra volume to the baby's silhouette, especially around the chest, shoulders, and arms. Consequently, it can give the illusion that the baby is bigger when wearing the undershirt, even if the shirt is also thick. In contrast, if a baby were to wear a thin undershirt under a thick shirt, the overall bulkiness would be primarily attributed to the shirt (option 2). However, since we are discussing that the undershirt makes the baby look bigger and not the shirt, it is evident that the undershirt is predominantly thick in this case (option 1). Moreover, a thick undershirt can often result in a snugger fit for the baby, especially when worn under clothes that are sized appropriately. This tight fit can cause the baby's features to be more pronounced, making the baby appear bigger. In contrast, a thin undershirt might lay flatter against the baby's body, producing a sleeker appearance, regardless of the shirt's thickness. In conclusion, the reason why the undershirt makes the baby look bigger and not the shirt is that the undershirt is thick. A thick undershirt adds extra volume and warmth to a baby's attire, creating a bulkier appearance when used as the innermost layer. This can give the illusion of a bigger-sized baby, regardless of whether the shirt worn over it is thick or not."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

For each inner list, use the 'max()' function to find the maximum number among its elements. 3. Append the maximum number to a new empty list named 'result'. 4. Continue this process for all inner lists. 5. After the loop is done, the 'result' list will contain all the maximum numbers from each inner list and will maintain the order of the original list. Using the example from the problem: input_list = [[-88, -143, -41], [72, -2]] 1. Start iterating through input_list:     First inner list: [-88, -143, -41] 2. Find the maximum number in this inner list using max() function: max([-88, -143, -41]) = -41 3. Append the maximum number to result: result = [-41] 4. Move to the next inner list in input_list: [72, -2] 5. Find the maximum number in this inner list: max([72, -2]) = 72 6. Append the maximum number to result: result = [-41, 72] 7.

Article: Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \\"Zhejiang model\\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \\"Zhejiang spirit\\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%. The per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan (US1,465), a real growth of 8.1% year-on-year.

The sentence \\"In those 2 years, awards totaling 17\\" tells us that the money from the awards added up to 17 in two years.

With 17, you can buy that toy and still have 7 left. In this case, 17 might not be a very small amount.

He wants her by hook or by crook, even peeking into private journal, so he dances his way into her heart by learning that she has always wanted to learn how to dance. He takes lessons from his friend, and gives Piya lessons. The two finally fall in love. But then later, Piya finds out that he looked in her private journal and she yells at him. He leaves, but leaves her his number in case she changes her mind. While at their new home, at an early hour in the morning, Ajay calls his friends to come to his house. While driving there, we see how Ajay has tried to win Piya back by getting her favourite dog (even though he hates them) and other things. When they go inside, they find Piya and Ajay, getting married. They are all surprised and delighted. Ajay and Piya love each other, and they soon start a wish list, which they write on their bedroom wall. The first wish is to go on a cruise on their 25th anniversary.

Premise: \\"The rules are judgmental, not probabilistic.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The rules are more probabilistic than they are judgemental.\\"?","output":"1. First, let's analyze the given premise: \\"The rules are judgmental, not probabilistic.\\" This statement asserts that the nature of the rules is based on judgment or evaluation, as opposed to being based on probabilities or likelihoods. 2. Now, let's look at the hypothesis we are investigating: \\"The rules are more probabilistic than they are judgmental.\\" This statement suggests that the rules favor a probabilistic approach over a judgmental one. 3. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we must evaluate whether accepting the premise as true would necessarily lead to the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, we must examine if the premise confirming that rules are judgmental and not probabilistic would lead to the conclusion that rules are more probabilistic than judgmental. 4. Analyzing the relationship between the two statements, we can see that they are conflicting in nature. The premise asserts the rules are judgmental, not probabilistic, while the hypothesis proposes that the rules are more probabilistic than judgmental. 5. Since accepting the premise as true means that the rules are fundamentally based on judgment rather than probabilities, this directly contradicts the hypothesis, which claims the opposite: that the rules are more probabilistic. 6. Therefore, the given premise does not entail the hypothesis. Accepting the premise as true would not lead to the conclusion of the hypothesis, and in fact, it contradicts it."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

In 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at 125 million. Forbes placed Jackson's annual income at 35 million in 1996 and 20 million in 1997. In the year after his death, more than 8.2 million of Jackson's albums sold in the US, and 35 million albums worldwide, more than any other artist in 2009. In 2014, Jackson became the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. He became the first artist to sell one million music downloads in a week, with 2.6 million song downloads. Thriller, Number Ones and The Essential Michael Jackson became the first catalog albums to outsell any new album. Jackson also became the first artist to have four of the top 20 best-selling albums in a single year in the US.Forbes reported in August 2018 that Jackson's total career pretax earnings in life and death were 4.2 billion. Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated 300 million in royalties.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Aquariums in Plymouth, Hull and Cheshire all received letters from PETA. Condemned popular attractions for serving seafood dishes to visitors. Compared the decision to offer fish to 'serving monkey nuggets at a zoo' Aquariums have hit back, claiming food they serve is responsibly sourced.","output":"Title: PETA Criticizes UK Aquariums for Serving Seafood Dishes – The Ethical Debate Introduction: Animal rights organization PETA has recently denounced three popular UK aquariums in Plymouth, Hull, and Cheshire for serving seafood dishes to their visitors. The group has accused these attractions of hypocritically claiming to educate the public about marine life while indirectly causing harm to fish species by contributing to their consumption. The Controversy: In the letters sent to the aquariums, PETA equated their decision to serve fish with the idea of 'serving monkey nuggets at a zoo,' highlighting the contradiction between promoting conservation and offering seafood to visitors. The organization believes that serving fish at these educational centers undermines their conservation message by supporting an industry linked to overfishing and environmental damage. Aquariums Respond: In response to PETA's criticism, the targeted aquariums have defended their position by asserting that the seafood they serve is responsibly sourced. They argue that their food suppliers adhere to strict sustainability standards, minimizing any potential harm to marine life and ecosystems. These establishments emphasize that by using responsible practices, they play a small and cautious role in fish consumption, promoting sustainable methods of harvesting marine life that are crucial for the planet's well-being. The Bigger Picture: While the aquariums involved in this dispute may claim to source their seafood responsibly, the overall global seafood industry does face significant ethical and environmental challenges. Overfishing, bycatch, and habitat destruction are just some of the issues that need to be addressed to ensure a more sustainable aquatic ecosystem for future generations. The PETA aquarium controversy shines a light on a broader issue faced by many conservatories, zoos, and other organizations dedicated to animal welfare and environmental stewardship. Can these institutions maintain the balance between fulfilling their educational and conservation goals while meeting the demands of visitors and observing ethical practices in every aspect of their operations? Conclusion: As the PETA-aquarium dispute continues to prompt discussion, it highlights the need for greater transparency and enforcement of ethical practices in the seafood industry. At the same time, it serves as a reminder to all organizations involved in the preservation of wildlife and natural habitats that their actions must align with the values they purport to uphold. Ultimately, this controversy should encourage further collaboration between animal rights organizations, the seafood industry, and public attractions to promote a more sustainable and ethically-conscious approach to protecting and preserving our planet's diverse and fragile ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for calm during a surprise visit to Jerusalem on Tuesday ahead of meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, in a high-profile gambit to bring an end to a monthlong wave of violence. The visit comes amid unrest that erupted a month ago over tensions surrounding a Jerusalem holy site sacred to Jews and Muslims. It soon spread to Arab neighborhoods of east Jerusalem and then to the West Bank, Gaza and Israel. A spate of Palestinian attacks, most of which have involved stabbings, has caused panic across Israel and raised fears that the region is on the cusp of a new round of bloodshed. The violence continued in the West Bank on Tuesday. A Palestinian attacker rammed his car into a group of Israelis waiting at a bus stop at a junction on the outskirts of Jerusalem in the West Bank, the Israeli military said. He then attempted to stab bystanders. A civilian and a soldier were injured in the attack before the attacker was shot and killed, it said. Earlier, a 24-year-old Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli forces after he stabbed an Israeli military officer and lightly wounded him, the Israeli military and Palestinian health officials said. The military said it happened during a “violent riot” of Palestinian demonstrators. In a separate incident in the West Bank, an Israeli man was killed after being run over during a clash with Palestinians. The man exited his car after Palestinian demonstrators threw stones at it and he began to hit passing Palestinian cars with a large stick, according to an Associated Press photographer who witnessed the incident. The man hit a passing truck with the stick, and the truck ran the man over. The Israeli military confirmed his death. The truck driver turned himself in, saying he hit the Israeli by accident while trying to swerve out of the way, according to a Palestinian security official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. Ban arrived from Europe Tuesday afternoon and is set to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He called for calm during a press conference with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and said “no society should live in fear.” “My visit reflects the sense of global alarm at the dangerous escalation in violence between Israelis and Palestinians,” he said. “I am here to encourage and support all efforts to lower tensions and prevent the situation from spinning out of control.” Ban added, “It’s not too late to avoid a broader crisis.” Prior to the visit, Ban issued a video message late Monday calling for calm on both sides. He said he understood the Palestinians’ frustrations, but that violence would only harm their legitimate aspirations. “I know your hopes for peace have been dashed countless times. You are angry at the continued occupation and expansion of settlements,” he said. “I am not asking you to be passive, but you must put down the weapons of despair.” Addressing Israelis, he said he understood their fears due to the security deterioration, but said there was no military solution. “When children are afraid to go to school, when anyone on the street is a potential victim, security is rightly your immediate priority,” he said. “But walls, checkpoints, harsh responses by the security forces and house demolitions cannot sustain the peace and safety that you need and must have.” Over the past month, 10 Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks, most of them stabbings. In that time, 43 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, including 21 labeled by Israel as attackers, and the rest in clashes with Israeli troops. An Eritrean migrant died after being shot by a security guard and beaten by a mob that mistakenly believed he was a Palestinian attacker. The initial outbreak of violence was fueled by rumors that Israel was plotting to take over Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site, a hilltop compound revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam’s third-holiest shrine and a key national symbol for the Palestinians. Israel has adamantly denied the allegations, saying it has no plans to change the status quo at the site, where Jews are allowed to visit but not pray. Israel has accused Palestinian leaders of incitement to violence over the site. But Jewish visits to the site have doubled since 2010 and senior members of Netanyahu’s government have called for Jewish prayer rights, fueling Palestinian concerns about the site. Israel has struggled to contain the attacks. Authorities have blocked roads and placed checkpoints at the entrances of Palestinian neighborhoods in east Jerusalem. Other security measures include ID checks and requiring some Palestinian residents to lift their shirts and roll up pant legs as they exit their neighborhoods to prove they are not carrying knives. Soldiers have been deployed in Jerusalem and cities across Israel. On Tuesday, the Israeli military arrested top Hamas official Hassan Yousef in the West Bank, saying he had been “actively instigating and inciting terrorism” by encouraging attacks against Israelis. “Hamas’ leaders cannot expect to propagate violence and terror from the comfort of their living rooms and pulpits of their mosques,” said Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a military spokesman. Yousef is a co-founder of Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules the Gaza Strip. His son, Mosab, spied for Israel between 1997 and 2007 and wrote a book about his experiences. Also Tuesday, the Israeli military demolished the home of a Palestinian who killed an Israeli woman last year. Maher Hashlamoun rammed his car into 25-year-old Dalia Lemkus in the West Bank last year and stabbed her several times before being shot and killed. His wife told Palestinian radio that soldiers evacuated their three-story building in Hebron and demolished the third floor apartment where her family lived. Lerner said the demolition “sends a clear message that there is a personal price to pay when you are involved in terror.” Summary:","output":"The United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, made a surprise visit to Jerusalem on a mission to encourage peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

As Polish resistance collapses, Dr. Lutz Heck, head of the Berlin Zoo and Adolf Hitler's chief zoologist and Jan's professional rival, visits the zoo while Jan is away. He offers to house the prized animals until after the war, later returning with Nazi soldiers to shoot the rest. He develops a romantic interest in Antonina. The Jews of Warsaw are forced into the Ghetto. The Żabińskis' Jewish friends, Maurycy Fraenkel and his partner Magda Gross, seek a safe place for a friend's insect collection. Antonina offers to shelter Magda. Knowing they can be executed for helping Jews, Jan and Antonina decide to use the zoo to save more lives. They seek out Heck to propose turning the abandoned zoo into a pig farm to feed the German occupying forces, secretly hoping to bring food to the Ghetto. Heck, in need of a new site for his experiments in recreating Aurochs as a symbol of the Reich, agrees. Jan collects garbage from the Ghetto for the pigs and sees Jews starving. He begins working with the Underground Army to transport Jews to safehouses throughout the country. Jews are hidden in the zoo's cages, tunnels, and inside the Żabińskis' house. After some trepidation, Antonina agrees to help. The Żabińskis continue smuggling Jews out of the Ghetto. In 1942, the Germans begin deporting Jews to death camps.

The first iron-cased and metal-cylinder rocket artillery were developed by Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali, in the 1780s. He successfully used these metal-cylinder rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2 km (1 mi) range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.According to Stephen Oliver Fought and John F. Guilmartin, Jr. in Encyclopædia Britannica (2008):  Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Tipu Sultan, continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.\\" A:","output":"The last name of the person who was defeated in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War is Sultan, as the person in question is Tipu Sultan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What happened to Rochester during the siege that was made worse by heat and flies? ?  It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were... A:","output":"During the siege of Rochester, the city and castle experienced dire conditions, which were made worse by heat and flies. Disease was rampant within the city, likely due to the unsanitary conditions that arose as a result of the ongoing assault and the large number of people confined in close quarters. The heat and the presence of flies further exacerbated the spread and intensity of the disease. These difficult circumstances contributed to the ultimate capitulation of the garrison and the surrender of the city to King William."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.  Question: \\"Which two factors were different between the three other hijacked planes and United 93?\\" Answer: \\"The airline operating the planes.\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct.

Movie title: Cellular Movie plot: Jessica Martin (Kim Basinger), a high school biology teacher, takes her son Ricky to the school bus. After she returns home, several men kidnap her and confine her in the attic of their safe house. Ethan Greer (Jason Statham), the group leader, smashes the attic's telephone. Jessica uses the wires of the broken phone and randomly dials a number. She reaches the cell phone of Ryan (Chris Evans), a carefree young man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend, Chloe (Jessica Biel). Jessica persuades Ryan to go to the police station, where he briefly reports to Mooney, but has to leave to avoid losing connection. Ethan asks Jessica about something, which she denies knowing, and leaves to get Ricky. Overhearing them, Ryan gets to Ricky's school, only to see the boy kidnapped. He hijacks a security officer's car and gives chase. When his phone battery runs out, he takes the gun in the car, cuts in line at a shop and buys a charger. Deciding to check on Ryan's kidnapping claim, Mooney goes to Jessica's house. At the house, he finds Dana Bayback (Valerie Cruz), the kidnappers' accomplice, posing as Jessica. Believing the claim is a false alarm, Mooney leaves. With Ricky in tow, Ethan returns and asks Jessica about a place her husband Craig mentioned, \\"The Left Field\\", and learns that it is a bar at the Los Angeles International Airport. A cross-connection between phone lines causes Ryan to rob a nearby lawyer's cell phone and car. At the airport, Ryan plants the gun on one of the kidnappers, which trips the alarm. When security intervenes, the kidnappers flash police badges and apprehend Craig. After viewing a news report of a man holding up a store for a charger, Mooney identifies Ryan and calls Jessica's home. He notices the voice on the answering machine is different from that of the woman he met. The kidnappers learns that Craig put a videotape in a bank safe deposit box.

Answer:","output":"In the movie Cellular, Ryan (played by Chris Evans) is a carefree young man who becomes inadvertently involved in a kidnapping situation when Jessica Martin (played by Kim Basinger), a high school biology teacher, reaches his cell phone after being kidnapped and confined to an attic by a group of men led by Ethan Greer (portrayed by Jason Statham).  As the story unfolds, Ryan deals with various individuals and situations in his attempt to help Jessica and rescue her and her son Ricky from their kidnappers. He first goes to the police station, where he reports the situation to Officer Mooney, but he has to leave quickly to avoid losing the phone connection with Jessica. Throughout the movie, Ryan encounters some challenges including his phone battery running out, having to hijack a security officer's car, and dealing with cross-connections between phone lines.  Apart from dealing with Jessica, the kidnapping victim, and communicating with her throughout the film, Ryan also interacts with the kidnappers. Ethan, the group leader, searches for specific information that Jessica and her husband possess. Meanwhile, Ryan tries to prevent the kidnappers from hurting Jessica and her family by intercepting their plans and attempting to rescue Ricky from being kidnapped. In a crucial scene, Ryan goes to the Los Angeles International Airport, where he plants a gun on one of the kidnappers to trip the security alarm. However, the kidnappers manage to flash fake police badges, apprehending Jessica's husband, Craig. Officer Mooney plays an essential role in the movie, as he first disregards Ryan's claims. Later, he realizes something is amiss after recognizing that the voice on Jessica's home answering machine is different from the woman (Dana Bayback, portrayed by Valerie Cruz) he met at the house, who is the kidnappers' accomplice. This realization leads Mooney to become more invested in the case, ultimately assisting Ryan in the investigation. To summarize, Ryan predominantly deals with Jessica, the kidnapping victim, who he communicates with throughout the story. He also interacts with the kidnappers (Ethan, their leader, and their accomplices) as he tries to save Jessica and her family from their dangerous predicament. Additionally, Ryan deals with Officer Mooney, who, despite initial skepticism, later becomes a helpful ally in the investigation of the kidnapping as he comes to rely on Ryan's information and instincts. Therefore, as the protagonist, Ryan interacts with different characters, both allies and antagonists, throughout the film to achieve his ultimate goal of rescuing Jessica and her family from the dangerous situation they are in."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What site of battles taking place was suggested by Evans to not have been developed independently among the local population? ?  In a 1946 paper, the folklorist John H. Evans recorded the existence of a local folk belief that a battle was fought at the site of the Coldrum Stones, and that a \\"Black Prince\\" was buried within its chamber. He suggested that the tales of battles taking place at this site and at other Medway Megaliths had not developed independently among the local population but had \\"percolated down from the theories of antiquaries\\" who believed that the fifth-century Battle of Aylesford, which was recorded in the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, took place in the area. Evans also recorded a local folk belief applied to all of the Medway Megaliths and which had been widespread \\"up to the last generation\\"; this was that it was impossible for anyone to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments. This \\"countless stones\\" motif is not unique to the Medway region, and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in Britain. The earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early 16th-century document, where it applies to the stone circle of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although in an early 17th-century document it was applied to The Hurlers, a set of three stone circles in Cornwall. Later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in England, as well as a single occurrence each in Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own.Several modern Pagan religions are practiced at the Medway Megaliths, with Pagan activity having taken place at the Coldrum Stones from at least the late 1980s. These Pagans commonly associated the sites both with a concept of ancestry and of them being a source of \\"earth energy\\". The scholar of religion Ethan Doyle White argued that these sites in particular were interpreted as having connections to the ancestors both because they were created by Neolithic peoples whom modern Pagans view as their \\"own spiritual ancestors\\" and because the sites were once...

Article: After entering World War II in December 1941 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the U.S. began to halt Japan’s aggressive expansion in the Pacific with important battle victories at Midway Island (June 1942) and Guadalcanal (August 1942-February 1943) in the South Pacific. American commanders next set their sights on an island-hopping campaign across the central Pacific. They intended to take the Marshall Islands followed by the Mariana Islands, then advance on Japan.      Did You Know? In the 76-hour Battle of Tarawa, U.S. Marines suffered almost as many killed-in-action casualties as U.S. troops suffered in the six-month campaign at Guadalcanal Island.      The Gilbert Islands, a group of 16 atolls near the equator, were viewed by the U.S. as a stepping stone to the Marshalls and became the first target of the Central Pacific Campaign. In November 1943, the U.S. launched an offensive code-named Operation Galvanic, in which the prime target was the tiny island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands. (As part of Operation Galvanic, the U.S. would also send a smaller force to the Gilberts’ Makin Atoll, some 100 miles north of Tarawa. Compared with the taking of Tarawa, the U.S. faced far less Japanese resistance at Makin and the Americans secured the atoll by November 23, 1943.) In late December 1941, Tarawa, a coral atoll located some 2,500 miles southwest of Hawaii, had been seized by the Japanese, who heavily fortified Betio, Tarawa’s largest island.      By November 19, 1943, American warships had arrived near Tarawa. Naval and air bombardments were planned for the next morning with the goal of weakening Japan’s defenses and clearing the way for 18,000 U.S. Marines to seize the island. However, the taking of Tarawa would prove to be more difficult than the Americans had anticipated. ||||| Alexander “Sandy” Bonnyman Jr. had grown up in Knoxville before serving in the Marine Corps during World War II and receiving the Medal of Honor posthumously for heroism on the island of Tarawa in 1943.      Later this year, he will finally receive a hero’s welcome, too, when his recently found body is returned to Knoxville for burial.      Clay Bonnyman Evans of Colorado, the Marine’s grandson, confirmed over the telephone Monday that he and a team of researchers from History Flight had found Bonnyman’s remains in a grave with a few dozen other Marines in late May.      “It was amazing,” said Evans, who was serving as a volunteer with the non-profit group that works with the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency to recover remains of missing military personnel.      “I didn’t count on this happening. When it did, I was shocked. I dropped my video camera and had tears in my eyes.”      He said researchers were able to identify his grandfather’s body through dental records that revealed his distinctive dental work. A cigarette lighter and a piece of metal that Evans is hoping is his grandfather’s dog tag were also recovered.      DNA verification is also being done, he said.      First Lt. Bonnyman had grown up in Knoxville as the son of Alex Bonnyman Sr., who was the chairman of the Blue Diamond Coal Co. and built a home designed by Charles Barber on Kingston Pike just west of the University of Tennessee campus.      After attending J.A. Thackston School in Knoxville and later boarding high school in New Jersey, the younger Bonnyman played on the football team at Princeton University.      He was briefly in the Army Air Corps in the early 1930s as a flying cadet, but later married, had three daughters and bought a copper mine in New Mexico before entering military service in World War II in the Marines.      According to his Medal of Honor citation, Bonnyman, a combat engineer, was on the South Pacific atoll of Tarawa in November 1943 when he led his demolition team on an assault on a Japanese bomb shelter.      He was eventually able to reach the top of the shelter and help flush out several of the enemy. As the Japanese began to fight back, Bonnyman remained in a forward position and was eventually killed, but not before he killed several Japanese troops, his citation said.      For his actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 1947 by the secretary of the Navy, and his 12-year-old daughter, Frances, accepted the award for the family.      Evans added that his grandfather is scheduled to be brought to Knoxville for burial in the family plot at Highland Memorial Park near Kingston Pike in Bearden, probably in September.      “I think it is going to be a big deal,” Evans said, adding that he has been in preliminary discussions with the U.S. Marines. ||||| Lost since 1943, remains of Alexander 'Sandy' Bonnyman unearthed on Pacific isle      Kristen N. Baker, History Flight's lead archeologist, carefully exposes the remains of 1st Lt. Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Bonnyman Jr. on Betio, part of the Tarawa Atoll, on May 28. Bonnyman was killed on the island in 1943, and his family — members of which now live in Boulder County — has spent decades searching for his remains. ( Courtesy Clay Bonnyman Evans / History Flight )      In Highland Memorial Park in Knoxville, Tenn., a large marble headstone stands in honor of 1st Lt. Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Bonnyman Jr., a Marine killed in action Nov. 22, 1943, during World War II's Battle of Tarawa.      Etched upon its surface, the only reference to the empty earth beneath it, are the words \\"buried at sea.\\"      For nearly 70 years, Bonnyman's family — members of which now live in Boulder County — remembered the handsome, adventurous man they had lost with what few artifacts they had left: his Medal of Honor, awarded posthumously for his efforts to hold back a Japanese counterattack; a large portrait, commissioned from an Italian oil painter; and a few black-and-white photographs taken during the assault on Betio.      Clay Bonnyman Evans, a former Daily Camera journalist, holds a picture of his grandfather, 1st Lt. Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Bonnyman Jr., at his mother's home in Gunbarrel on Monday. (Ryan Gooding / For the Camera)      After his death, the military issued a letter stating that most of the Tarawa war dead were presumed lost at sea near the island.      But without conclusive proof that Bonnyman was among them, his family began a decades-long campaign to procure information about their beloved soldier's final resting place.      It's a campaign that now, finally, has come to an end.      Bonnyman's skeletal remains were unearthed on the island of Betio, in the central Pacific southeast of the Marshall Islands, last month.      The remains, along with those of 35 other U.S. Marines, were uncovered by an archaeological team from History Flight, the result of a 10-year, multimillion dollar effort by the Florida nonprofit group to find and recover missing U.S. service members.      Advertisement      \\"I actually grabbed my stomach and thought, 'Good grief. Is it really going to happen?' I never thought it would,\\" Bonnyman's oldest daughter, Frances Evans, now 81, said Monday from her home in Gunbarrel.      \\"My grandfather had written lots of letters ... without any success. It came as a shock. It was a bit of a jolt.\\"      Clay Bonnyman Evans, a former Daily Camera reporter and editor who lives in Niwot, was on Betio the day his grandfather's remains were uncovered.      First Lt. Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Bonnyman Jr. is among the U.S. Marines seen in this photo taken during the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943. (WO Obie Newcomb Jr. / National Archives)      \\"It feels great,\\" Clay Evans said Monday of the culmination of his family's generation-spanning quest. \\"My great-grandparents really worked hard to get his remains back. They wrote letters, and they just sort of got every story in the book from the military; they thought they would never have his remains.\\"      The 'unrecoverable' dead      While several hundred remains were exhumed on Betio by an American Graves Registration Service team in June 1946, the search was largely abandoned, and, in 1949, hundreds of war dead on the island were declared \\"unrecoverable\\" by the Quartermaster General's office, according to History Flight.      Over the years, letters and calls went unanswered as Bonnyman's family sought answers, and the details of the soldier's death and burial became even further muddied in the memories of his loved ones.      A glimmer of hope came in 2010, when a joint team from the Defense POW and MIA Accounting Agency began a recovery mission on the Gilbert Islands in hopes of locating the mass graves in which U.S. and Japanese soldiers were said to have been buried.      That was the first time members of Bonnyman's family — some of whom were unaware the remains were still missing — heard that there might be chance of recovery.      History Flight's own efforts had begun in 2006.      Using magnatomatry, radar scans and cadaver dogs, as well as hundreds of interviews with surviving veterans of the Battle of Tarawa, a map of burial sites began to take shape.      Burial markers erected by naval construction crews after the war were nearby the original, temporary markers constructed by Marines that identified the graves' actual locations.      \\"The monuments were in the proximity, but not right on top of them,\\" said Mark Noah, founder and director of History Flight. \\"We recreated some of the original burial records and were able to find out how they had accidentally lost the graves by not knowing who was where.\\"      Inaccurate records were just one of the many challenges facing Noah and his agency. The massive cost of a dig, from 5,000 to 8,000 per day, is the \\"largest challenge\\" to the donation-funded charity, Noah said.      Incredible population density — 25,000 people in the 1 square mile that encompassed the tombs — and urban development on private property meant years of cooperative efforts to gain access.      'An honor and privilege'      Cemetery 27, the site from which Bonnyman and 35 others were recovered, was identified in 2011, underneath a parking lot. Excavation began in March of this year, and continued through the end of June.      On May 28, Bonnyman's cranium was revealed, gold teeth glinting in the central Pacific sun.      Clay Evans said there was \\"no doubt\\" that the skull belonged to his grandfather, one of the few men with such extensive dental work among the battalion.      Bonnyman was fully exhumed May 29, and his remains were positively identified June 16 by a forensic dentist.      \\"It has been an honor and privilege to lead our recovery team and find these long-missing U.S. servicemen,\\" History Flight archaeologist Kristen N. Baker said in a news release. \\"These brave men made the ultimate sacrifice over 70 years ago, and they deserve the best possible repatriation that we can give them. I hope they will finally receive the heroes' departure and welcome home they truly deserve.\\"      With the discovery of Bonnyman's remains, there are only 30 Medal of Honor winners killed in World War II whose final resting places are still unknown, according to Laura Joyey of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.      Bonnyman was the last of four Medal of Honor recipients from the Battle of Tarawa to be located.      'Best possible place for him to go'      Bonnyman, born in Atlanta and raised in Knoxville, Tenn., enlisted at the age of 31, leaving a wife and three children at home.      Though his age exempted him from the draft, he was deeply moved by the attack on Pearl Harbor, his daughter, Frances Evans, said.      It was Frances, at age 12, who later traveled to Washington, D.C., with her mother to receive her father's Medal of Honor.      Bonnyman enlisted in April 1942. After training in San Diego, he set sail for New Zealand in October of the same year. He first saw combat in the Battle of Guadalcanal as a combat engineer.      On Nov. 13, 1943, he set sail for Tarawa, learning en route where his final destination would be. During the battle, which claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Marines, Bonnyman led a small crew of men in an offensive to claim a concrete blockhouse integral to the Japanese campaign on the island.      He was killed on the third day of the assault.      Bonnyman's remains will be flown to a military lab in Hawaii in July, and returned to the family by the end of August. He will then be buried at the family plot in Knoxville in late September, in one of the empty plots underneath that large marble monument bearing those false words about his final resting place.      \\"I think the irony of it is fantastic,\\" said Clay Evans, who is completing a book about his grandfather's life. \\"But it's extremely meaningful, because if you read the letters (they wrote) ... my great-grandfather, it was brutal for him. He really wanted this, and he died before he knew. And my great-grandmother died before she knew. And my great uncle, who took up the effort, died in 2004. He will lie next to parents, and his two sisters and his brother, right there.      \\"This was the best possible place for him to go, to finish the story.\\"      Shay Castle: 303-473-1626, castles@dailycamera.com, twitter.com/shayshinecastle ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In late May 1943, the remains of Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Bonnyman Jr., a World War II Marine who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, were found on the island of Betio in the central Pacific southeast of the Marshall Islands.

Tube-like structures once thought to be a type of seaweed were made by a worm that lived a solitary life on the sea bed, say scientists. The research, published in the journal BMC Biology, suggests the animal, Oesia, was a filter feeder. Fossil discoveries of this kind are rare. The research was carried out by academics from the universities of Cambridge, Toronto and MontrÃ©al, and at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. Prof Simon Conway Morris, from St John's College, University of Cambridge and a co-researcher on the study, said: \\"Oesia fossils are pretty enigmatic - they are very rare and until now we could not prove which group they belonged to. \\"Now we know that they were primitive hemichordates - perhaps the most primitive of all.\\" Hemichordates are a group of creatures that belong to a larger group called deuterostomes, of which vertebrates (including humans) form a separate branch.

Answer a question about this article: At the same time, the political party reached its modern form, with a membership disciplined through the use of a party whip and the implementation of efficient structures of control. The Home Rule League Party, campaigning for Home Rule for Ireland in the British Parliament was fundamentally changed by the great Irish political leader Charles Stewart Parnell in the 1880s. In 1882, he changed his party's name to the Irish Parliamentary Party and created a well-organized grass roots structure, introducing membership to replace \\"ad hoc\\" informal groupings. He created a new selection procedure to ensure the professional selection of party candidates committed to taking their seats, and in 1884 he imposed a firm 'party pledge' which obliged MPs to vote as a bloc in parliament on all occasions. The creation of a strict party whip and a formal party structure was unique at the time. His party's efficient structure and control contrasted with the loose rules and flexible informality found in the main British parties; – they soon came to model themselves on the Parnellite model. Did the Irish Parliamentary Party ever adopt the Parnellite model?","output":"The question is asking if the Irish Parliamentary Party ever adopted the Parnellite model. Based on the text provided, it is clear that the Irish Parliamentary Party did not just adopt the Parnellite model, it was created by Charles Stewart Parnell in the 1880s. The text says \\"In 1882, he changed his party's name to the Irish Parliamentary Party and created a well-organized grass roots structure...,\\" which indicates that the Parnellite model was the system implemented by Parnell himself for his own party, The Irish Parliamentary Party. So it did not simply 'adopt' the model, but was shaped by it from the beginning. The 'Parnellite model', a term probably coined after Parnell for his innovative party structure and discipline, was later taken as a model by other British parties."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of both the Royal Academy of Music (1920) and the Royal College of Music (1923). Jacobs lists 26 compositions dedicated to Wood, including, in addition to the Vaughan Williams Serenade to Music, works by Elgar, Delius, Bax, Marcel Dupré and Walton.

Croatia is the home country for the breed . The name translates into English as the Scenthound From The Sava Valley , but is usually translated as the Posavac Hound .  - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator.  - A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds or landraces of terrier type, which are typically small, wiry, very active and fearless dogs. Terrier breeds vary greatly in size from just to over and are usually categorized by size or function. There are five different groups with each group having several different breeds.  - The gray wolf or grey wolf (\\"Canis lupus\\"), also known as the timber wolf or western wolf, is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging , and females . Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other \\"Canis\\" species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur. , 37 subspecies of \\"C. lupus\\" are recognised by MSW3.  - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism.  - A hunting dog refers to a canine that hunts with or for humans. There are several types of hunting dogs developed for various tasks. The major categories of hunting dogs include hounds, terriers, dachshunds, cur type dogs, and gun dogs. Among these categories further divisions can be made based upon the dogs' skill sets.  - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Zagreb is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level. In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887. It is the biggest metropolitan area in Croatia, and the only one with a population of over one million.  - The dachshund (or or ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed.  - \\"Hound\\" is a synonym for \\"dog\\", also used in a more specific sense to refer to a type of dog used by hunters to track or chase prey.  - Gun dogs, or bird dogs, are types of hunting dogs developed to assist hunters in finding and retrieving game, usually birds. Gun dogs are divided into three primary types: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. Some kennel clubs define a Gundog Group for gun dogs, while other kennel clubs include them in the Sporting Group.  - A cur is a type of dog. CUR refers to:  - Canis is a genus of canids containing multiple extant species, such as wolves, dogs and coyotes. Species of this genus are distinguished by their moderate to large size, their massive, well developed skulls and dentition, long legs, and comparatively short ears and tails.  - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.  - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile.  - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.  - Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia. Responding to political, social and economic pressure, many Croats have migrated throughout Europe (especially Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Italy) and the Americas (particularly the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile), establishing a diaspora.

In fact, Google was the one who paid up.      This is the second time the teenaged reverse engineer enthusiast was able to collect the grand exploit prize from Google in less than a year. In order to take advantage of the computer underground, Google recently began allowing anonymous participants to hack its Chrome systems with the understanding that they would report all vulnerabilities and collect a prize at the end. This second “Pwnium,” as it’s called, occurred at the Hack in the Box Conference in Kuala Lumpur.      Google labeled the discovery “critical” and called it “another beautiful piece of work.” The company promises it will not release details about any of the vulnerabilities discovered during Pwnium unless the majority of users have been patched.      Google announced the contest in August, promising up to 2 million in prizes to those with the best exploits. Those who found a “full exploit” win up to 60,000, whereas a “partial exploit” will bring 10,000 less. Google isn’t the only one with a program like this. The first Pwnium only offered 1 million in prizes, although that’s not exactly chump change for hacking into one of the most famous companies in the world.      Facebook also financially supports a “bug bounty” program, which pays hackers and developers to find vulnerabilities in the social network’s systems.      hat tip Ars Technica; Pinkie Pie image via Mooshuu/Flickr ||||| A teenager who goes by the name Pinkie Pie has made 60,000 (£37,446) for hacking into Google for a second time.

It is currently spring time where Jonathan lives, and there is a high amount of pollen in the air. When Jonathan goes outside his eyes start to water and become itchy, and he can't stop sneezing. Jonathan's brother, Thomas, was recently invited to a seafood dinner.  Thomas decided to eat some shellfish, and a short while later he felt like his throat was closing up and it was becoming difficult to breathe.  Hint: Allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms might include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Severe symptoms can cause difficulty breathing, which may be life threatening. Keep in mind that it is the immune system and not the allergen that causes the allergy symptoms. Allergy symptoms can be treated with medications such as antihistamines. Severe allergic reactions may require an injection of the hormone epinephrine. These treatments lessen or counter the immune system’s response.

Question: what are SATA Power Connector The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the provided answer does not correctly address the question about SATA Power Connector. A detailed answer for the question is as follows: SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) is a computer bus interface used for transferring data between the motherboard and storage devices, such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives, and optical drives. The SATA Power Connector is a 15-pin connector responsible for providing power to these storage devices. This connector is part of the SATA standard and has replaced PATA (Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment) connectors in modern computers. The SATA power connector is designed to provide more efficient power delivery to SATA devices and offers better scalability, reduced cable bulk, and easier cable management compared to the PATA power connector. The 15-pin connector carries three different voltage lines: +3.3V, +5V, and +12V, which are used to supply power to various components of the storage devices. These voltages are distributed across the pins as follows: - Pins 1-3: +3.3V (Orange) - Pins 4-6: Ground (Black) - Pins 7-9: +5V (Red) - Pins 10-12: Ground (Black) - Pins 13-15: +12V (Yellow) While PATA-based technologies like CompactFlash (CF) and the newer CFast standard (SATA-based) are still in use, especially in industrial and embedded applications, the question about the SATA Power Connector focuses on the electrical connectivity aspect of SATA devices rather than on the specific storage technologies mentioned."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She was out of Mango, okay, well Taro. Taro they had... (I would hope so). They were also out of Boba and I had to wait 15 minutes for a fresh batch to finish cooking. Really? C'mon... well, it's grand opening, gotta get some kinks out... easily forgivable.   Well, as I'm 15 minutes into waiting for my drinks... I still hadn't received the calamari I ordered. As I was sitting at the bar, I looked down at the cool refrigerated bar where they store their frozen fruits and I saw a big container of MANGO. I then see and hear the \\"new\\" owner take a Mango Boba order from an asian gentleman. WHAT?!?!?! So I turned and asked her, do you have mango? She again says, no, no mango right now. I get up from the bar seating to approach the gentleman that ordered the mango and ask him about his mango drink... it's then that the \\"new\\" owner who seems to be aware as to what I'm about to do tells the gentleman that she is out of Mango and he needs to order something else. (AT this point, I should've pointed out that she does have mango, I know what mango looks like, I'm half Filipino, though I do not really look it.) My drinks came out right then and I just grabbed them and left.   This new owner obviously does not realize that it's truly mostly customer service that brings repeat business.

She was a true owner that took an interest in her customers, I am sad that she moved back to Cali.   As far as the drinks go, they were of very liquidy consistency and the bobas were overcooked. The calamari tasted like they purchased it premade with Italian seasonings on it. I'm actually quite confident it had Italian seasonings on them and they were heavily breaded.   I frequented Juice House Boba on a regular basis making the 25 minute one-way drive at least once a week--with an owner that knew exactly what I wanted the moment I walked in.

Given the following passage  \\"Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975.

The people who were studied were between the age of 18 and 24 when the research began. The researchers who carried out the study say they consider the people fat if they are in the top of 5% of the measurement in which weight is linked to height. For example, fat women in the study were about 160 centimeters tall and weighed about 90 kilograms. Fat men in the study were about 175 centimeters tall and weighed 100 kilograms. The researchers say that more than 1,000,000 Americans are that big. The researchers found that fat young women were from wealthy families. The fat women also were 20% less likely to get married and they earned an average of about 6,700 a year less than other women. The study showed less effects on fat men. They earned an average of about 3,000 a year less than other men. Fat men also were 11% less likely to get married. Question: The researchers consider the people fat if    _   .

William Ben Hogan (August 13, 1912 - July 25, 1997) was an American professional golfer who is generally considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of the game. He was born within six months of Sam Snead and Byron Nelson, who were two other acknowledged golf greats of the 20th century. Hogan is notable for his profound influence on golf swing theory and his legendary ball-striking ability. His nine career professional major championships tie him with Gary Player for fourth all-time, trailing only Jack Nicklaus (18), Tiger Woods (14) and Walter Hagen (11). Hogan was born in Stephenville, Texas, the third and youngest child of Chester and Clara (Williams) Hogan. His father was a blacksmith and the family lived ten miles southwest in Dublin until 1921, when they moved 70 miles (112 km) northeast to Fort Worth. When Hogan was nine years old in 1922, his father Chester committed suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot at the family home. By some accounts, Chester committed suicide in front of him, which some (including Hogan biographer James Dodson) have cited as the cause of his introverted personality in later years.  The family incurred financial difficulties after his father's suicide, and the children took jobs to help their seamstress mother make ends meet. Older brother Royal quit school at age 14 to deliver office supplies by bicycle, and nine-year-old Ben sold newspapers after school at the nearby train station. A tip from a friend led him to caddying at the age of 11 at Glen Garden Country Club, a nine-hole course seven miles (11 km) to the south. One of his fellow caddies at Glen Garden was Byron Nelson, later a tour rival. The two would tie for the lead at the annual Christmas caddie tournament in December 1927, when both were 15. Nelson sank a 30-foot putt to tie on the ninth and final hole. Instead of sudden death, they played another nine holes; Nelson sank another substantial putt on the final green to win by a stroke.  The following spring, Nelson was granted the only junior membership offered by the members of Glen Garden. Club rules did not allow caddies age 16 and older, so after August 1928, Hogan took his game to three scrubby daily-fee courses: Katy Lake, Worth Hills, and Z-Boaz.

Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What grinds rocks over time?\\" is \\"wind.\\" This natural phenomenon is responsible for a type of weathering known as abrasion. Wind abrasion involves the grinding of rocks over long periods of time due to the movement of particles, such as sand or small rocks, against the rock surface. These particles are carried by the wind and collide with the rocks, causing their gradual wearing down. This process, combined with other weathering processes caused by wind, contributes to the overall deterioration and reshaping of the Earth's landscape. Wind is not the only force responsible for weathering; chemical, biological, and other physical forces can also cause rock to break down over time.

Article: In October, Ubayd Steed, a sixth grader in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was taking a math test when he noticed a classmate looking at his paper. \\" I quickly turned my paper over,\\" he said. Later that day, Ubayd met the cheater and told him not to do it again. Unfortunately, Ubayd' s experience is not unusual. Whether it's kids copying class -mates' answers during tests or friends sharing homework, cheating happens in schools every day. Experts say the behavior starts in the lower grades. Surveys show that one in three elementary students admits to cheating. Jacob Harder, a fourth grader in Ware, Massachusetts, has had classmates ask to copy his homework. \\"I wouldn't want to just tell them the answers,\\" he says. So instead, he explains the task and encourages his classmates to do it themselves. But many kids find it hard to say no. \\"l hear from kids all the time, ' I can' t say no to a friend,'\\" says Eric Anderman, a professor at The Ohio State University who studies cheating in school. He says it' s important to say no from the start. \\"Then you _ , and the other kid gets the message,\\" he says. Plus, he points out, \\"a real friend is not going to disown you because he or she couldn't copy your math homework.\\" The kids doing the copying may feel they need to cheat to be accepted by other kids. And some students may cheat simply because others do. \\"If you' re in an atmosphere where cheating is common, you may think that if you don' t cheat, you' re at a disadvantage,\\" says Michael Josephson, founder of the Josephson Institute of Ethics. But Josephson says students shouldn't think that way. \\"There are a lot of things kids do,\\" he says. \\"You have to decide what kind of person you' re going to be.\\" When school becomes too challenging, Anderman suggests going to the teacher rather than relying on the work of others. \\"It' s good to ask for help,\\" he says.

Context: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses.

Tsugumo HanshirÅ arrives at the estate of the Ii clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him SaitÅ Kageyu (RentarÅ Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells HanshirÅ the story of another rÅnin, Chijiiwa Motome â formerly of the same clan as HanshirÅ. Motome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as HanshirÅ. Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, HanshirÅ is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of SaitÅ and the Ii retainers, HanshirÅ successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuroâthe three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. After provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, HanshirÅ recounts his story to SaitÅ and the Ii retainers. He did, he admits, know Motome after all. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun. His Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, HanshirÅ planned to die alongside him.

From the very moment we entered the elegantly designed restaurant, we were warmly welcomed by the staff. Despite being a busy Friday night, our reservation was promptly honored, and we were escorted to our table, which was beautifully set up for our special occasion. The atmosphere of the restaurant was cozy and inviting, with soft lighting that heightened the sophisticated ambiance. Soft instrumental tunes played in the background, enhancing the overall dining experience and creating the perfect setting in which to savor the delicacies that awaited us. The wide windows across one side of the restaurant allowed us to enjoy the enchanting cityscape view while we dined. Upon reviewing the extensive and diverse menu, it was apparent that The Food Fusion truly lived up to its name. They have successfully married flavors from diverse culinary traditions, offering an impressive array of dishes incorporating Asian, European, and South American cuisines. Our knowledgeable and friendly waiter expertly guided us through the menu and offered thoughtful suggestions based on our preferences and dietary restrictions. For starters, we shared the \\"Taste of Fusion\\" sampler, which was a stunning array of bite-sized delights, including crispy and tender coconut shrimp, juicy lamb ceviche crostini, and mouthwatering vegetable tempura. Each dish was artfully presented, with attention to detail that elevated the experience to a new level. Next, we moved on to the main course, where I opted for the succulent \\"Tandoori Surf and Turf,\\" a creative blend of juicy tandoori spiced steak and grilled lobster tail. The flavors were perfectly balanced, and the portion sizes were generous without being overbearing. During our meal, the staff maintained an optimal level of attentiveness, ensuring that our water glasses were always filled, and our dishes were cleared promptly. Our waiter checked in on us just the right number of times, making sure we were enjoying our experience while being considerate of our privacy and conversation. To wrap up the evening, we indulged in a delectable assortment of desserts. The chocolate lava cake, in particular, was a decadent treat with a velvety-smooth texture, and it flowed like molten lava as we dove into it with our spoons. Alongside our desserts, we enjoyed a round of expertly crafted mocktails, which tasted as delightful as they looked. All in all, our evening at The Food Fusion was a truly memorable celebration. The outstanding food, exceptional service, and elegant atmosphere made for a remarkable dining experience that we cannot wait to revisit.

This perception is based on the use of several critical and unfavorable words and phrases used throughout the sentence. Here's a breakdown of the sentiment conveyed by each part of the sentence: 1. \\"almost completely lacking\\": This phrase implies that the movie is very deficient in the qualities that follow. The use of \\"almost completely\\" amplifies the extent of the lack, indicating that these missing elements are a major shortcoming of the movie. 2. \\"in suspense\\": Suspense is a crucial attribute for any movie that aims to captivate and engage the viewer. By stating that the movie is lacking in suspense, the reviewer suggests that it fails to maintain the audience's attention or build anticipation effectively. 3. \\"surprise\\": A lack of surprise implies that the movie is predictable, and its plot doesn't offer any meaningful twists or unexpected revelations. The absence of surprise likely contributes to a monotonous and unengaging viewing experience, further adding to the negative sentiment. 4. \\"consistent emotional conviction\\": This phrase means that the movie struggles to maintain a strong emotional connection or authentically convey the feelings of the characters throughout its entirety. This lack of emotional resonance impacts the audience's ability to empathize with the characters and become invested in their storylines. 5. Overall, the sentiment of this sentence is unequivocally negative, as it highlights the absence of key elements – suspense, surprise, and emotional conviction – that contribute to an enjoyable and engaging movie-watching experience. The use of strong, negative language such as \\"almost completely lacking\\" further enhances this perception of dissatisfaction. In conclusion, the sentiment of this sentence would be perceived as negative, expressing the reviewer's disappointment and disapproval with the movie due to its inability to effectively elicit suspense, surprise, and maintain consistent emotional conviction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"A weak immune system can significantly affect the body's ability to fight off the flu virus and potentially lead to less virus particles being produced or exiting the infected cells. Although the question asks about the effect of a weak immune system on virus particle production and exit from the cell, it is essential to understand a brief overview of the immune system's role in combating viral infections before addressing the potential effects. The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs responsible for protecting the body against infections, including those caused by viruses such as the flu virus. It consists of two primary defense mechanisms: the innate immunity, which acts as the body's first line of defense, and the adaptive immunity, responsible for a more specific and targeted attack against pathogens. When a virus enters the body, the innate immune system is the first to respond. It deploys various cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells to detect and destroy foreign invaders. Additionally, the innate immune response includes the production of cytokines and chemokines, which facilitate communication between immune cells and recruit more of them to the site of infection. These cells and molecules act together to limit the spread of the virus, killing some of the infected cells and preventing the virus from infecting additional cells. If the innate immune response is insufficient, the adaptive immune system kicks into action. This involves the activation of B cells, which produce antibodies that can neutralize the virus, and T cells that can identify and kill infected cells. The adaptive immune response takes time to develop, but once established, it provides long-lasting, specific immunity against a particular pathogen. Now, in the case of an individual with a weak immune system, both the innate and adaptive immune responses can be compromised. This means that the body is less efficient in detecting and combating the invading virus. As a result, the flu virus may continue to infect and reproduce within the host cells, potentially causing a more severe and prolonged illness. However, the weakened immune system may have a limited effect on the number of viruses that come out of the cell. This is because the immune response mainly focuses on limiting the viral spread to new cells and the destruction of infected cells, rather than directly interfering with the virus's ability to reproduce within the host cell. Therefore, if the host cell's machinery is not significantly affected, the virus can still reproduce and exit the cell. In conclusion, a weak immune system may have an indirect effect on the number of virus particles leaving the infected cells. However, the primary influence can be observed in the body's ability to limit the viral spread to new cells and the effective destruction of infected cells, which can lead to a prolonged and more severe illness in people with weakened immune systems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: Kyle Orton threw for 299 yards to outduel Rodgers, one of the game’s elite quarterbacks, and the Kansas City Chiefs rallied behind interim coach Romeo Crennel for a shocking 19-14 victory that ended the Packers’ 19-game winning streak. It was their first loss since Dec. 19, 2010, at New England. Green Bay, playing without leading receiver Greg Jennings and top rusher James Starks because of injuries, also squandered a chance to wrap up home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. “I didn’t see a bunch of guys running around talking about 16-0. That was my sense of it,” Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. “We knew what type of game we were coming into today. This was no surprise. It wasn’t just talk. We answered the questions all week. “We knew we were coming into a juggernaut and we didn’t overcome it.” If the Packers knew they were facing a juggernaut, they might have been the only ones. The Chiefs had lost five of their last six games, which culminated in the firing of coach Todd Haley last Monday. Tyler Palko, who started the past four games at quarterback, wasn’t even active Sunday as Crennel opted to go with Orton in his first start since arriving in Kansas City. Orton wound up putting together the kind of solid performance the Chiefs have been lacking since Matt Cassel went on injured reserve because of a hurt throwing hand — perhaps even before that. “That was a good football team we beat,” Orton said. “The coaches put together a good game plan for us. Everybody on offense, everybody on the team, did their job. They didn’t try to do too much.” Rodgers was 17 of 35 for 235 yards and a touchdown, and he also scampered 8 yards for another touchdown with 2:12 left. But the Packers (13-1) were unable to recover the onside kick, and Kansas City picked up a couple of first downs to secure the victory. “I knew we had the 2-minute (warning) and three timeouts, regardless if we kicked it deeper or onside,” Rodgers said. “If they got it, we had a chance to stop them and get the ball back.” Ryan Succop kicked four field goals for Kansas City (6-8), while Jackie Battle added a short touchdown plunge with 4:53 left in that ultimately sealed the win. “Everybody had marked it off as a win for the Packers, but those guys in the locker room, they’re football players,” Crennel said. “They decided that they were not going to lay down. They were not going to give up, so they went out and played a tremendous game.” Neither team played all that tremendous in the first half. Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson was hit twice with offensive pass interference, Rodgers was harassed by the Chiefs’ weak pass rush, and Green Bay wound up making five first downs. One of them came when Kansas City’s Jeremy Horne ran into punter Tim Masthay, giving the Packers 15 free yards. The Chiefs tried to give Green Bay another gift later on the drive when Crosby missed a 59-yard field-goal attempt but Kansas City had 12 men on the field.

A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons.

Group A had a normal diet, while group B consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for 2 years. Group B gained lots of weight.  But I can use this background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  What is an answer for this question: Which group had fewer people that may become obese? A:","output":"Based on the given background information and the new situation, it can be concluded that Group A would have fewer people that may become obese compared to Group B. In the nutrition study, Group A followed a normal diet, which implies that they likely maintained a balanced calorie intake and consumed an appropriate amount of energy required by their bodies. This would reduce the possibility of consistently consuming more food energy than needed, which contributes to obesity. On the other hand, Group B consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for 2 years. This excessive calorie intake would result in a surplus of unused energy from carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. As mentioned, any unused food energy is stored in the body as fat. With 3,500 extra Calories leading to the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat, it is highly likely that the participants in Group B experienced significant weight gain. Considering the definition of obesity as a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 kg/m^2 or greater, this substantial increase in body fat increases the chances of the individuals in Group B becoming obese. Obesity is associated with a higher risk of health problems, including type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

The introduction of the guided missile resulted in a significant shift in anti-aircraft strategy. Although Germany had been desperate to introduce anti-aircraft missile systems, none became operational during World War II. Following several years of post-war development, however, these systems began to mature into viable weapons systems. The US started an upgrade of their defences using the Nike Ajax missile, and soon the larger anti-aircraft guns disappeared. The same thing occurred in the USSR after the introduction of their SA-2 Guideline systems. The introduction of what caused the larger anti-aircraft guns to disappear in the USSR?","output":"The introduction of the Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) systems, particularly the SA-2 Guideline, caused the larger anti-aircraft guns to disappear in the Soviet Union. SAM systems, like the SA-2, presented several improvements over traditional anti-aircraft guns, making them a more effective solution for air defense. The SA-2 Guideline, known in Russian as the S-75 Dvina, was a Soviet-designed, high-altitude, medium-range SAM system capable of engaging aircraft, cruise missiles, and even ballistic missiles. It was first deployed in the mid-1950s and played a crucial role in shaping anti-aircraft strategy in the Cold War-era Soviet Union. The advantages of the SA-2 and other SAM systems over larger anti-aircraft guns included the following: 1. Longer Range: SAM systems, like the SA-2 Guideline, had a significantly greater range than anti-aircraft guns. The SA-2, for example, could engage targets at distances up to 30 kilometers, while traditional anti-aircraft guns typically had a shorter range. This extended reach of SAM systems allowed for broader defense coverage, making it more difficult for enemy aircraft to penetrate defended airspace. 2. Higher Maximum Altitude: Traditional anti-aircraft guns were limited in their ability to engage high-altitude targets, while SAM systems could reach higher altitudes with greater ease. The SA-2 Guideline could engage targets at altitudes up to 25 kilometers, offering better defense against high-altitude bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. 3. Improved Accuracy: SAM systems generally provided better accuracy and more effective engagement of enemy aircraft compared to anti-aircraft guns, which relied on gun crews and analog targeting systems. Guided missiles, like the SA-2, employed radar guidance and onboard electronics to track and home in on their targets, improving the likelihood of successful engagements. 4. Faster Response: SAM systems offered a quicker response time than anti-aircraft guns, as missiles could accelerate faster and reach their intended altitude more quickly. This improvement in response time made it more difficult for enemy aircraft to evade air defense systems once detected. 5. Enhanced Versatility: SAM systems were also more versatile than anti-aircraft guns, being capable of engaging multiple types of targets, including aircraft, cruise missiles, and even ballistic missiles. The aforementioned benefits of SAM systems, such as the SA-2 Guideline, coupled with ongoing advancements in missile technology, ultimately led to a shift away from larger anti-aircraft guns in the Soviet Union. Instead, resources were focused on developing and deploying more effective air defense missile systems to counter evolving aerial threats, solidifying the role of SAM systems in modern anti-aircraft warfare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The three old men then go home to the mansion they share with Madame Tanya, an elderly countess dispossessed by the Russian Revolution, for a dinner with prestigious guests. When the guests cancel at the last minute, George is convinced it is because of his dark past. To relieve George's black mood, Michael comes up with an idea to obtain new guests for dinner. Each man throws out a wallet containing 10 and his business card into the street. George's is found by Arlene Terry, who merely gives the money to her driver and discards the wallet.

Classical scholar Timothy Barnes relates contemporary allegations against Athanasius: from defiling an altar, to selling Church grain that had been meant to feed the poor for his own personal gain, and even violence and murder to suppress dissent. Athanasius used \\"Arian\\" to describe both followers of Arius, and as a derogatory polemical term for Christians who disagreed with his formulation of the Trinity. Athanasius called many of his opponents \\"Arian\\", except for Miletus. What did the term Arian mean to him?","output":"To understand the meaning of the term \\"Arian\\" according to Athanasius, let's break down the context and background of the situation step-by-step: 1. Context: Athanasius was a bishop of Alexandria, Egypt, during the 4th century. He played a pivotal role in shaping the early Christian church and defining the doctrine of the Holy Trinity at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. Arius was a priest from Alexandria who introduced a theological doctrine known as Arianism, which opposed the concept of the Holy Trinity and proposed that Jesus Christ was not co-eternal with God the Father, but rather a subordinate created being. 2. Arianism: Arianism was a significant theological controversy during the early Christian church, which was primarily in opposition to the doctrine of the Holy Trinity as defined by Athanasius and the Nicene Creed. The central idea of Arianism was that Jesus Christ was a created being and not divine in the same way as God the Father. This posed a significant threat to the fundamental beliefs of Christianity as Athanasius understood and defended. 3. Polemical usage: Athanasius used the term \\"Arian\\" not only to describe the followers of Arius but also as a derogatory term for those Christians who disagreed with his views on the Holy Trinity. By labeling his opponents as \\"Arians,\\" he aimed to discredit them and associate them with a theological doctrine that had been condemned by the majority of the Christian church. 4. Exceptions: Athanasius did not label all his opponents as \\"Arians,\\" as seen in the example of Miletus. This indicates that while he applied the term broadly, it was not without considerations of the specific views of his opponents. In conclusion, the term \\"Arian\\" for Athanasius was essentially a label that he used to denigrate and invalidate the beliefs of his opponents who disagreed with his understanding of the Holy Trinity. This term was particularly charged due to its association with the controversial and widely condemned doctrine of Arianism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

And the answer is?","output":"The name of the bear in the Muppet Show is Fozzie Bear. Fozzie is an iconic character who has been a part of the Muppets since their creation by puppeteer and creator Jim Henson. The Muppet Show, which is a family-friendly variety show, first premiered in 1976 and became a massive success. The show featured a mixture of comedy skits, musical performances, and various acts with human guest stars, all performed by a vibrant cast of Muppet characters, including the famous bear, Fozzie. Fozzie Bear is a warm-hearted and lovable character, and he is best-known for his role as a stand-up comic in the Muppet Show. He is usually depicted wearing a brown hat and a red and white polka-dotted tie, and his distinctive features include his round face, plump nose, and huggable fur. His character is often portrayed as a sweet and optimistic, yet somewhat naive, aspiring comedian. Fozzie's comedic style primarily revolves around slapstick humor and the use of puns, which often serve as the punchlines for his jokes. Unfortunately, these jokes mostly fall flat, leading to a running gag on the show where Fozzie faces a barrage of heckling and criticism from other characters, particularly the cantankerous duo Statler and Waldorf, who frequently jeer at him from their theater box. Despite his lack of success on the comedic front, Fozzie Bear is a loyal and supportive friend to the other Muppets, especially Kermit the Frog, who serves as the show's host and leader. The bond between them is showcased throughout the show, and the two have even had moments of heartwarming camaraderie. The character of Fozzie Bear was originally performed by the legendary puppeteer, Frank Oz. Oz voiced and operated Fozzie from the Muppet Show's inception in 1976 until his last regular performance in 2000. After Oz's departure, puppeteer Eric Jacobson took over the role of Fozzie, continuing to bring him to life in various Muppet productions and appearances. Fozzie Bear remains a beloved and integral figure in the Muppet universe, and his endearing presence continues to capture the hearts of fans, both young and old, through his iconic performances in the Muppet Show, Muppet movies, and other related productions. His resilience in the face of constant ridicule demonstrates the importance of staying true to oneself and remaining optimistic, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: The bed should be reserved as a place for sleep, but people tend to read an iPad a lot in bed before they go to sleep. Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard Medical School, and his colleagues got a small group of people for an experiment. For five days in a row, the people read either a paper book or an iPad for four hours before sleep. Their sleep patterns were monitored all night. Before and after each trial period, the people took hourly blood tests to paint a day-long picture of just how much melatonin   was in their blood at any given time. When subjects read on the iPad as compared to the paper books, they reported feeling less sleepy at night and less active the following morning. People also took longer to fall asleep on the iPad nights, and the blood tests showed that their melatonin secretion   was delayed by an hour and a half. The researchers conclude in today's journal article that given the rise of e-readers and the increasingly widespread use of e-things among children and adolescents, more research into the long-term consequences of these devices on health and safety is urgently needed. Czeisler and colleagues go on, in the research paper, to note:\\"Reading an iPad in bed may increase cancer risk.\\" However, software has been developed that can reduce some of the blue light from the screens of phones and computers according to time of day, and there are also glasses that are made to filter   short wavelengths.

Context: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors.

The crisis deepened during the 17th century with the expulsion in 1609 of the Jews and the Moriscos, descendants of the Muslim population that converted to Christianity under threat of exile from Ferdinand and Isabella in 1502. From 1609 through 1614, the Spanish government systematically forced Moriscos to leave the kingdom for Muslim North Africa. They were concentrated in the former Kingdom of Aragon, where they constituted a fifth of the population, and the Valencia area specifically, where they were roughly a third of the total population. The expulsion caused the financial ruin of some of the nobility and the bankruptcy of the Taula de Canvi in 1613. The Crown endeavoured to compensate the nobles, who had lost much of their agricultural labour force; this harmed the economy of the city for generations to come. Later, during the so-called Catalan Revolt (1640–1652), Valencia contributed to the cause of Philip IV with militias and money, resulting in a period of further economic hardship exacerbated by the arrival of troops from other parts of Spain.

(Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — Digging deeper into a culture war that he's repeatedly stoked, President Donald Trump called off a visit to the White House by the Philadelphia Eagles, citing the dispute over whether NFL players protesting racial injustice must stand during the playing of the national anthem.      Trump said in a statement Monday that some members of the Super Bowl championship team \\"disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.\\"      He said the team wanted to send a smaller delegation Tuesday, but \\"the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better.\\"      Instead, Trump said he would be hosting \\"a different type of ceremony,\\" featuring the U.S. Marine Band and the U.S. Army Chorus, that \\"will honor our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it, and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem.\\"      None of the Eagles took a knee during the anthem in 2017.      One of the people set to attend the ceremony told The Associated Press less than half of the team's 53-man roster planned to go. The person spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the decision.      Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney replied with his own statement, saying that he is \\"equally proud of the Eagles' activism off the field\\" and that the players \\"represent the diversity of our nation — a nation in which we are free to express our opinions.\\"      \\"Disinviting them from the White House only proves that our President is not a true patriot, but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend,\\" Kenney said.      Last week, Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins said he would not attend the ceremony because he didn't want to be part of a photo op and wanted \\"to avoid being used as any kind of pawn.\\" In addition to Jenkins, defensive end Chris Long was the most outspoken player against going. Quarterback Carson Wentz had planned to attend.      It was unclear exactly what prompted the change of plans. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about what had sparked the decision and why the circumstances were different from other events honoring winning teams, which some players have boycotted.      Late Monday, though, Trump wrote on Twitter that \\"Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event.\\"      Several players asked about Trump's decision not to host them declined to respond. The Eagles issued a statement without directly addressing the White House cancellation.      \\"Watching the entire Eagles community come together has been an inspiration,\\" the team statement read. \\"We are truly grateful for all of the support we have received and we are looking forward to continuing our preparations for the 2018 season.\\"      Wide receiver Torrey Smith, who said previously that he planned to skip the visit, responded with a series of tweets.      \\"So many lies,\\" he wrote, adding, \\"Not many people were going to go.\\"      Smith, who played on the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia team before being traded to the Carolina Panthers in March, added: \\"No one refused to go simply because Trump 'insists' folks stand for the anthem. ... The President continues to spread the false narrative that players are anti military.\\"      He went on: \\"There are a lot of people on the team that have plenty of different views. The men and women that wanted to go should've been able to go. It's a cowardly act to cancel the celebration because the majority of the people don't want to see you. To make it about the anthem is foolish.\\"      The announcement was the latest signal that tensions remain high around the NFL protests that began in 2016 when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began silently kneeling on the sidelines while the anthem played. Kaepernick's protest was an effort to raise awareness around systemic racism and, specifically, the killing of black men by police.      He was soon joined by teammate Eric Reid. Both Reid and Kaepernick have filed grievances against the NFL and remain unsigned since their contracts with the 49ers expired.      Last season, Vice President Mike Pence left the 49ers game against the Indianapolis Colts after about a dozen San Francisco players took a knee during the anthem. Pence, who left before kickoff, tweeted soon afterward, \\"I left today's Colts game becaue @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.\\"      Trump has repeatedly decried the players' protest, referring to them as \\"sons of bitches\\" who should be fired at a rally for supporters in Alabama last year. Last month, the NFL announced a new policy - praised on Twitter by both Trump and Pence - requiring players to stand for the anthem if they're on the field before a game.      After the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl in 2017, several players declined to attend the White House ceremony honoring their team last August, citing their differences with the president. In February, the Golden State Warriors declined to attend the White House ceremony honoring their 2017 NBA Championship, instead using their trip to Washington to visit the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture.      During an interview after the new NFL policy was announced, Trump praised the league for doing \\"the right thing.\\"      \\"You have to stand proudly for the national anthem,\\" Trump said. Or \\"you shouldn't be playing, you shouldn't be there. Maybe they shouldn't be in the country.\\"      Late Monday, Trump added on Twitter: \\"Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!\\"      Several members of the Eagles have voiced staunch opposition to the owners' decision.      \\"This is a fear of the diminished bottom line,\\" Long said last month. \\"It's also fear of a president turning his base against a corporation. This is not patriotism. Don't get it confused. These owners don't love America more than the players demonstrating and taking real action to improve it.\\"      Jenkins has vowed to carry on the cause.      \\"I will not let it silence me or stop me from fighting,\\" he said recently. \\"This has never been about taking a knee, raising a fist or anyone's patriotism, but doing what we can to effect real change for real people.\\"      Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., invited the Eagles to come to Capitol Hill.      \\"I'm proud of what the @Eagles accomplished this year. I'm skipping this political stunt at the White House and just invited the Eagles to Congress. @Eagles How about a tour of the Capitol?\\" he wrote.

The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation, but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better.\\"      It's an unprecedented move by Trump. The NBA champion Golden State Warriors declined an invitation from the President to visit the White House after winning the 2017 championship, but presidents typically honor their invitations to championship teams. Players also have refused those invitations in the past -- Boston Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas declined to visit the White House in 2012 over disagreements with President Barack Obama's policies.      The President typically invites the champions of major professional and college sports to the White House for a visit as a part of their victory celebrations.      The movement was initially started by Colin Kaepernick, who was formerly with the San Francisco 49ers. He drew national attention for refusing to stand during \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" prior to kickoff.      \\"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\\" Kaepernick told NFL Media in August 2016      Trump has r epeatedly criticized players for not standing for the anthem and has gone as far as to say team owners should fire players for doing so.      The new NFL policy gives players the option of remaining in the locker room during the playing of the anthem if they do not wish to comply.      Trump later tweeted, \\"The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!\\" The Eagles have not stayed in the locker room as a means of protesting the anthem.      The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House.

Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2018      Players on the Eagles are some of the most outspoken social justice activists in the NFL, and multiple players took part in the protests during the anthem over the last two seasons. Many players from the team were not planning on attending the ceremony as a protest of Trump, his policies and his outspoken criticism of players who chose to kneel during the anthem.      The Eagles were originally invited to the White House after their win in February's Super Bowl over the New England Patriots. It was the first Super Bowl championship in franchise history.      In response to Trump's announcement, former Eagles receiver Torrey Smith, who was a member of the championship team and was traded during the off-season, called the move \\"a cowardly act.\\"      So many lies smh      Here are some facts      1.

Not many players wanted to go, the player said.      \\"The number was low,\\" he said.      But the issue Trump brought to the fore -- players kneeling during the National Anthem -- was not one of the team's chief concerns. The player said the issue was never mentioned in the meetings.      A separate NFL source said none of the players on the Eagles team that won the Super Bowl took a knee during the anthem during the regular season -- one player took a knee in the preseason but was cut before the regular season began. Safety Malcolm Jenkins raised his fist during the anthem to protest racial injustice before some games, but he stopped when the NFL pledged to make a 100 million donation to various charities in November.      Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said he's skipping the White House event, and instead invited the team to take a tour of the US Capitol.      \\"I'm proud of what the @Eagles accomplished this year.

No; Though these two questions are related and touch upon similar themes, they do not have the exact same meaning. The differences lie in their respective assumptions and focus. Question 1: \\"Could Sanders have won had Hillary not stolen the election from him?\\" This question assumes that Hillary Clinton actively or unfairly took the Democratic nomination from Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary elections. It presumes that Sanders had a reasonable chance of winning but was hindered by some act or maneuver carried out by Clinton or her campaign. The focus of this question is to explore whether it would have been possible for Sanders to win the general presidential election had he become the Democratic nominee instead of Clinton. Question 2: \\"Had Bernie Sanders been nominated, how would the election have gone?\\" This question also evaluates the hypothetical scenario in which Bernie Sanders becomes the Democratic nominee, but it does not assume any wrongdoing on Hillary Clinton's part. The key difference here is that the focus is not on whether Sanders could have won, but on how the general election landscape would have looked with Sanders as the Democratic candidate. This question invites speculation on various aspects of the election, such as voter turnout, campaign strategies, and potential results in different states, while also considering the other candidate's campaign. In conclusion, although these questions are related, they have different meanings and implications.

In 1960, Indianapolis Mayor Charles Boswell appointed Jones director of the Human Rights Commission. Jones ignored Boswell's advice to keep a low profile, finding new outlets for his views on local radio and television programs. When the mayor and other commissioners asked Jones to curtail his public actions, he resisted and was wildly cheered at a meeting of the NAACP and Urban League when he yelled for his audience to be more militant, and then climaxed with, \\"Let my people go!\\"  During this time, Jones also helped to racially integrate churches, restaurants, the telephone company, the police department, a theater, an amusement park, and the Methodist Hospital. After swastikas were painted on the homes of two African-American families, Jones personally walked the neighborhood comforting local black people and counseling white families not to move, in order to prevent white flight.  Jones set up stings to catch restaurants refusing to serve black customers and wrote to American Nazi leaders and then leaked their responses to the media. When Jones was accidentally placed in the black ward of a hospital after a collapse in 1961, he refused to be moved; he began to make the beds and empty the bed pans of black patients. Political pressures resulting from Jones' actions caused hospital officials to desegregate the wards.  Jones received considerable criticism in Indiana for his integrationist views. White-owned businesses and locals were critical of him. A swastika was placed on the Temple, a stick of dynamite was left in a Temple coal pile, and a dead cat was thrown at Jones' house after a threatening phone call. Other incidents occurred, though some suspect that Jones himself may have been involved in at least some of them.

It has said it is \\"in serious financial crisis\\" and workers have been told there is a \\"business necessity\\" to cut costs in Belfast by 20% by 2017. Davy Thompson from the Unite union said they will be going back to the table to try and negotiate an improved offer. He said 88% of Unite members at Bombardier Northern Ireland involved in the ballot had rejected the proposal. \\"While we recognise that Bombardier faces exceptional cash-flow pressures, the membership of Unite has exercised their democratic right in relation to this offer,\\" he added. \\"We will now seek to engage with management in order to progress this matter further.\\" It is understood that workers were most unhappy about changes to allowances that are paid for working shifts. For some staff, that could have meant a significant drop in take home pay. There was also a perception that workers in Bombardier's Canadian plants had been given a more generous deal. In a statement, Bombardier said: \\"It is vital that we reduce our costs significantly if we are to sustain our business here and ultimately protect jobs in the long term. \\"The company remains open to engaging with the trade unions in order to find a resolution. \\"We will continue to look at measures to reduce our costs and improve our competitiveness.\\" On Wednesday, the manager of Bombardier's Northern Ireland operation said the Canadian bailout of the firm's CSeries project posed no threat to jobs in Belfast.

The CSeries will employ at least 800 people in Belfast at full production, out of 5,500 in total. Mr Ryan told Bloomberg that the Northern Ireland plant had skills in composite manufacturing that made it a world leader in wing production, safeguarding its status. The development of the narrow-bodied CSeries passenger plane has placed a major strain on Bombardier's finances.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less embryos develop into fetuses happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis presented suggests that fewer embryos develop into fetuses, and we are asked to analyze the possible effects of this on the process of oxygenation in the body. Let's begin by breaking down the question and considering the potential direct or indirect impacts on the oxygenation process. First, let's consider the biological aspects related to embryo development. Embryonic development is a critical and complex stage of human reproduction, and it is known that several factors can influence the progression of an embryo to a fetus, including genetic, environmental, and physiological factors. The hypothesis does not provide specific information about the cause of the decrease in the number of embryos developing into fetuses, so we will address the potential effects more generally.  At the most basic level, if fewer embryos develop into fetuses, there would be fewer humans born. A decreased population would potentially result in decreased oxygen consumption on a global scale, as there would be fewer individuals performing the respiration process. However, this would primarily have an indirect effect on the overall quantity of oxygen being brought into the body at an individual level. Now let's examine the impact on the specific process of oxygenation mentioned in the question: 1. Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth. 2. The air travels into the windpipe. 3. The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes. 4. The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body. 5. Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body. 6. The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream. 7. The carbon dioxide is exhaled. The perturbation hypothesis has no direct effect on the above process in individuals who have successfully developed from embryos to fetuses and have been born. In these individuals, the respiratory system would continue to function as normal, meaning that the process of oxygenation would remain unaffected. However, the impact of fewer embryos developing into fetuses would be an overall decrease in the total consumption of oxygen -- this is a broader ecological implication rather than a direct effect on the oxygenation process in individuals. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis proposing that fewer embryos develop into fetuses has no direct effect on the process of oxygenation at the individual level, as the respiratory system would continue to function as usual in those who successfully develop. The primary impact of this scenario would be a decreased human population, which would indirectly contribute to less overall oxygen consumption but would not directly impact the oxygenation process within individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPTIONS: (i) No (ii) Yes A:","output":"(i) No A steam engine works based on the fundamental principle of converting heat energy into mechanical energy. The statement \\"By 1883, engines that could provide 10,000 hp had become feasible\\" does not provide an adequate explanation of how a steam engine works. Instead, here is a detailed and long explanation: A steam engine consists of several key components, including a boiler, pistons, cylinders, valves, and a condenser, among others. The primary fuel source, often coal or wood, is burned in the boiler to heat water and produce steam. As the steam is generated at high pressure, it flows into the cylinders where it interacts with pistons. These pistons are connected to the engine's wheels through a mechanism, such as a connecting rod and crankshaft. The high-pressure steam entering the cylinder pushes the piston, creating movement that is then transferred to the wheels, setting the engine in motion. To ensure continuous motion, the steam engine employs a valve system that allows steam to enter and exit the cylinder at specific intervals, based on the position of the piston. Once the steam has done its work on the piston, it must be expelled from the cylinder to create space for fresh high-pressure steam. In some early steam engines, the spent steam would simply be released into the atmosphere. However, in more efficient engines like James Watt's design, a separate condenser chamber was used to convert the used steam back into water. This water could then be returned to the boiler, creating a closed loop system that minimized waste and maximized efficiency. The quoted statement about engines providing 10,000 hp by 1883 highlights the technological advancements of the time, but does not explain the working principles of steam engines. Developments in design, materials, and manufacturing allowed for the creation of larger, more powerful engines with increased efficiency during the 19th century. However, understanding the underlying mechanism of steam engines requires a detailed explanation of heat energy conversion, the interactions between components, and the systems in place for maximizing efficiency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Over to Athens.....      Our correspondent Helena Smith has confirmed that the proposed reforms have indeed been sent to the country’s creditors - and three hours AHEAD of the midnight deadline central European time.      Government insiders are saying the proposals were sent at 1OPM Greek time (9 PM central European time) to all three creditors and the president of the Euro Group of euro area finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem.      The Dutch finance minister must sign off on the reforms before they are submitted for further discussion to EU leaders.      The proposed package - a biting mix of tax hikes and swingeing cutbacks - was tabled in parliament as an emergency bill on Thursday. It will, say officials, be put to vote on Friday evening in order to invest the Greek prime minister, his deputy Yannis Dragasakis and finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos with the appropriate authority to conduct talks around the proposed reforms.      Until a cast-iron agreement is reached, the vote will not be binding - rather is is aimed exclusively at furnishing the central protagonists in Greece’s negotiating team with the authority to debate with creditors around the proposed reforms.      Once negotiations are completed it will become law.      After several drama-filled days, replete with apocalyptic scenarios, a ray of hope was seen tonight. The vast majority in Tsipras’ radical left Syriza party accept that chaos lies the other way.      But the devil will be in the detail. Panagiotis Lafazanis, who heads Syriza’s militant wing, the Left Platform, has already expressed his wholehearted opposition to the proposed plan saying it fails to give any hope of a breakthrough to the Greek economic crisis. The Left Platform represents about a third of the party.      Zoe Konstantopoulou, the president of the parliament and a member of Syriza’s hard left herself, has publicly announced that no new memorandum outlining further austerity will be passed by the 300 seat House.      Although, Konstantopoulou has just spent 3.5 hours with Tsipras.... and has left his office refusing to make any comment! ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Greek PM Alexis Tsipras spent Thursday seeking support for his reform plans      Greece's government has agreed a reform programme and will submit its proposals to its international lenders soon, the defence minister has said.      The reforms are thought to include tax rises and pension changes.      Greece is due to present the proposals by 22:00 GMT on Thursday to try to secure a third bailout and prevent a possible exit from the eurozone.      The new proposals will be studied by eurozone finance ministers on Saturday and a full EU summit on Sunday.      Defence Minister and junior coalition party leader Panos Kammenos gave no further details of the agreed plans as he left the prime minister's official residence, where ministers had been meeting.      Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has spent the day discussing the proposals with his cabinet.      Greek media are reporting that the reforms will be put to the Greek parliament on Friday for approval.      On Wednesday Greece formally submitted a request for an unspecified loan from the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund.      This would be a fresh loan \\"to meet Greece's debt obligations and to ensure stability of the financial system\\", Greece says - in other words, to avoid bankruptcy.      The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, who will chair Sunday's EU summit, said he hoped to receive \\"concrete and realistic proposals of reforms from Athens\\".      Such proposals \\"will have to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability from the creditors. Only then will we have a win-win situation,\\" Mr Tusk added.

'Just do it'      She described Sunday's EU summit as a decisive and important meeting.      \\"We must not forget that the Greek people are suffering at the moment,\\" she said.      German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble also ruled out debt relief for Greece, saying \\"there cannot be a haircut because it would infringe the system of the European Union\\".      Greece needs to implement reforms to win the trust of its eurozone partners, Mr Schaeuble said.

European Stability Mechanism explained      Greece's creditors - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF - have already provided more than €200bn in two bailouts since a rescue plan began five years ago.      The second bailout expired on 30 June.      The creditors had hoped for new, concrete proposals from Greece at a meeting on Tuesday but these were not submitted and they instead agreed to set a new deadline of Thursday.

Mr Tsipras's Syriza party was elected in January pledging to oppose the harsh austerity measures demanded by creditors.      And on Sunday, the Greek people decisively rejected the latest bailout proposals from creditors in a referendum.      Energy minister and influential Syriza member Panayiotis Lafazanis insisted on Thursday that Greece would not sign up to a third bailout if it brought \\"harsh austerity, suffering and deprivation to the Greek people\\".

He is the leader of a gang which commits political crimes for the local politician Tiwari Bhaisaab (Naseeruddin Shah). Ishwar 'Langda' Tyagi (Saif Ali Khan) and Keshav 'Kesu Firangi' Upadhyay (Vivek Oberoi) are his closest lieutenants. The movie starts with Langda Tyagi gate-crashing a baraat and challenging Rajju (Deepak Dobriyal), the bridegroom, to try and stop Omkara from abducting the bride, Dolly Mishra (Kareena Kapoor). Rajju fails and the wedding never takes place. Dollyâs father Advocate Raghunath Mishra (Kamal Tiwari), mostly referred in the movie as vakeel saab (lawyer sir), is furious and confronts Omi. He puts a gun to Omiâs head and demands the return of his daughter. Bhaisaab intervenes and resolves the conflict by mentioning the current political conditions and prevents bloodshed. Still unconvinced, Raghunath grieves to Bhaisaab the next day. To bring an end to this issue, Dolly is made to appear in front of her father and clarify that she eloped with Omi and was not abducted. She also tells the events of how she fell in love with Omkara. The father leaves feeling betrayed and ashamed. The director here references one of the most significant lines of the play Othello, with Dolly's father repeating the couplet almost verbatim, albeit in translation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. 'Maladolescenza' has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its child protagonists, forest setting, and the discovery of a castle's ruins. Yet at its core, the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents. Opening with a dream sequence employing the not-so-subtle metaphor of Fabrizio wrestling with his menacing hound, the film details his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who has pledged her love to him, and his eventual romance with the equally malicious Sylvia. The film's psychological complexities do give the film merit, yet there's no doubting how unnecessarily exploitive the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex. The film's look relies more on its gorgeous locations rather than particular cinematographic skill, and there's no doubting the film's greatest asset is the creepy, children's choir-augmented soundtrack. With its odd dreamlike quality, the film is at best interesting, yet pales beside Louis Malle's surreal and brilliant 'Black Moon' from the same era. Certainly deserving of the art versus pornography debate, for unlike many banned films, Pasolini's 'Salo' or Larry Clark's 'Ken Park' for instance, the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic perspective. Cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock, so perhaps 'Maladolescenza' should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release. However shock value is the one reason alone the film is memorable.  The film does have its defenders. Yet so does Nazism. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mixed with a predominantly critical tone. The reviewer acknowledges certain artistic aspects of the film, like the psychological complexities, dreamlike quality, and its eerie soundtrack. However, they also express strong disapproval of the film's exploitative depiction of nudity and sex involving adolescents, as well as its limited cinematographic skill. They argue that the film is primarily memorable for its shock value and controversial nature while being relatively unremarkable artistically. The reviewer further implies that just because some defend the film, it does not necessarily make a valid argument, as they compare it with the defense of Nazism, which has a universally negative connotation. Overall, the sentiment showcases an appreciation of some creative aspects of the film but is largely critical of its controversial elements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As the body temperature rises, the brain signals the blood vessels to dilate, allowing more blood flow to the skin surface, which helps in dissipating the heat. 3. The brain also activates the sweat glands, which produce moisture on the skin. 4. This moisture is released from the pores and evaporates, taking away the excess heat and helping the body to cool down. 5. If it is hot outside, this process will be more active and intense as the body tries to maintain a constant temperature and keep the person cool under the increased heat conditions. 6.

He would make videos about almost anything – about his toys, his food, his pets, and even stories he made up in his head. One day, he saw something incredibly exciting. He thought, \\"Oh! This will make a super duper awesome video!\\" He quickly whipped out his phone, which was so big that it was almost comical – as if a tiny mouse was trying to carry a giant piece of cheese! You know how some phones are small and can easily fit into your pocket? Not this one, oh no. This was a BIG phone, a phone that would make any five-year-old say, \\"Wow, that's almost as big as my teddy bear!\\"  Now, right when he was about to press the record button, he suddenly realized something. The video he wanted to capture was too large! Imagine trying to fit an elephant into a tiny car, or a whole giant rainbow into a little bottle. That's how large the scene was.  It was just too big and amazing to be captured fully on his phone. You see, videos are like boxes. And just like you can only fit so many toys into a box, you can only fit so much video on a phone.  So even though the boy had a phone as big as a teddy bear, it still wasn't big enough to record the whole wide, wonderful scene in front of him. But that's okay, because he realized that sometimes, the most special moments are the ones we keep in our hearts, not just in our phones. That's the end of the story for now, kiddo.

The less clear you are about what you want to do, the less effective your plan will be. Try to specifically define what you want to achieve as early as possible — preferably before starting your project. Example: You are trying to complete your master’s thesis — basically a very long essay — which needs to be about 40,000 words. It will include an introduction, a literature review (in which you critically discuss other research that informs yours, and discuss your methodology), several chapters in which you put your ideas into practice using concrete examples, and a conclusion. You have 1 year to write it. Identify your end goal, then list everything you need to do to accomplish it. Depending on your goal, you may even consider different ways to reach your goal. After you know what you need to accomplish, break this down into actionable steps to help you create a more realistic plan.  Keep in mind that your plan may change as you work toward your goal, so stay flexible. Make sure that your goals are S.M.A.R.T. to ensure that your plan is effective: Specific - Be clear about what you want to achieve. Measurable - You can break down the goal into measurable checkpoints. Attainable - You are capable of completing the steps necessary to reach the goal. Relevant - The goal makes sense for your life and purpose. Timely - You have the time to work toward your goal and are progressing on schedule. Having a specific goal is just the beginning: you need to be specific and realistic in every aspect of your project — for example, by stating specific and achievable schedules, milestones, and final outcomes.  Being specific and realistic while planning a long project is all about pro-actively reducing stress that can accompany poorly planned projects such as missed deadlines and exhausting long hours. Example: To finish your thesis on time, you need to write roughly 5,000 words per month, which will give you a couple of months at the end of your timeline to polish your ideas. Being realistic means not placing the expectation on yourself to write more than 5,000 words each month. If you’re working as a teaching assistant for three of those months, you’ll need to consider that you may not be able to complete 15,000 words in that time, and you’ll need to spread that amount out over your other months. Milestones mark significant stages along the road to achieving your end goal. Create milestones easily by starting at the end (the accomplishment of the goal) and working your way backwards to your present day and circumstances.  Having milestones can help you — and if applicable, your team — stay motivated by breaking the work into smaller chunks and tangible goals so that you don’t need to wait until the project is completely finished to feel as though you’ve accomplished something. Don’t leave too much time or too little time between milestones — spacing them two weeks apart has been found to be effective.  Example: When writing your thesis, resist the urge to set milestones based on chapter completions, as this could be a matter of months. Instead, set smaller milestones — perhaps based on word counts — every two weeks, and reward yourself when you hit them. Some tasks or milestones may seem more daunting to achieve than others.  If you’re feeling overwhelmed by a large task, you can help ease your anxiety and make it feel more doable by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. Example: The lit review is often the most difficult chapter to write, as it forms the foundation of your thesis. In order to complete your lit review, you need to do a significant amount of research and analysis before you can even begin writing. You can break it into three smaller chunks: research, analysis, and writing. You can break it down even smaller by choosing specific articles and books that you need to read, and setting deadlines for analyzing them and writing about them. Make a list of tasks that you need to complete in order to hit your milestones. A list on its own will not be effective — you must write this list into a timeline associated with specific, realistic actions. Example: By breaking your lit review into smaller chunks, you’ll know exactly what you need to get done, and can figure out a realistic timeframe for those tasks. Perhaps every one to two days you will have to read, analyze, and write about one key reading. Without specific time frames and deadlines, work will definitely expand to fill the time allotted, and some tasks may never get completed.  No matter what action items you choose for which phase of your action plan, it is essential that a time frame be attached to absolutely everything. Example: If you know that it takes you roughly 1 hour to read 2,000 words, and you’ll be reading a 10,000-word article, you need to give yourself at least 5 hours to complete that article. You’ll need to also account for at least 2 meals during that time, as well as short breaks every 1 to 2 hours for when your brain is feeling tired. In addition, you’ll want to add at least an hour onto your final number just to account for any possible unanticipated interruptions. Once you’ve listed your action items and set a specific timeline, the next step is to create some type of visual representation of your plan. You might use a flow chart, a Gantt chart, a spreadsheet, or some other type of business tool to accomplish this. Keep this visual representation in an easily accessible place — even on a wall in your office or study room, if possible. Marking things off as you go will not only feel satisfying, it will help you keep on track lest you forget what you’ve already done. This is particularly important if you’re working with other people. If you’re working with other people, you might consider using a shared online document so that everyone can check in no matter where they are. As you work through your action plan, keep notes of everything. You may find it helpful to have a binder with different tabs in it to section off different aspects of your planning process. Some examples of sections:  Ideas/Miscellaneous notes Daily Schedules Monthly Schedules Milestones Research Follow-up Individuals involved/Contacts Once your plan is established and shared with the team (if applicable), and your milestones are scheduled, the next step is simple: take daily actions to achieve your goal. Although you want to stay persistent, you should also be flexible. It's likely that unexpected events will come up that require you to shift your schedule or plan. Occasionally, circumstances or unforeseen events can arise that throw a wrench in your ability to meet deadlines, complete tasks and achieve your goal. If this happens, do not get discouraged – revise your plan and continue working to meet targets and move forward. Summary:","output":"To effectively plan and execute long-term projects, set clear and specific goals using the S.M.A.R.T. criteria, create actionable steps and milestones, break down larger tasks into smaller components, establish a timeline, visually represent your plan, maintain notes throughout the process, and adapt your plan as needed while staying persistent."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As Miami Beach continues to develop; wildlife officials and volunteers are making sure the beach remains a welcoming place for these endangered animals.  The sea turtle patrol   starts his day at sunrise. \\"The reason we need to get out at first light is to make sure we see the tracks before anybody else gets out here, Bill Ahern says, \\"Something that weighs 350 pounds is going to leave evidence.\\" Bill Ahern directs the sea turtle program in Miami-Dade county. His team monitors and marks nests left by sea turtles who lay eggs in the sand and then return to the sea. The patrols also work with beach residents to keep track of new nests and possible threats to existing ones. Nearly 65,000 turtles nested on Florida's Atlantic coast last year. A tiny part comes to Miami Beach where they face many risks. Tough laws have been passed to punishpoachers . And bright lights from nearby buildings can confuse newly born turtles, attracting them onto roads instead of into the ocean. \\"I recall in the mid-1960s, me and my beach buddies(policemen) would pick up hatchlings from the road and put them back in the water,\\" he recalls .To avoid that problem, city officials have imposed limits on coastal lighting.   Although most sea turtles hatch on their own, coming out at night, some have a harder time. In the future, the Sea Turtles Program hopes to do away with the hatchery.  Educating beach-goers is a step in that direction. Each week, people are invited to see a release of newly born turtles recovered from nests. The experience helps sunbathers understand the role of the beach in the turtle's life cycle.   \\"Only a part of the newly hatched turtles will escape predators and man-made dangers in their first year.\\" Their instincts  are so sharp ,\\" Ahern says, \\"I'll face a turtle to the... Question: What do Ahern and his sea turtle patrol do in the early morning? Answer: A:","output":"In the early morning, Ahern and his sea turtle patrol go out at first light to locate and identify sea turtle tracks on the beach. They do this to find and mark nests left by sea turtles who lay eggs in the sand and then return to the sea. The patrol also works with beach residents to keep track of new nests and monitor any possible threats to existing ones. They try to spot the tracks before anyone else gets out on the beach to ensure the evidence remains undisturbed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

The next day, December 26, 1991, the Council of Republics, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, issued a formal Declaration recognizing that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a state and subject of international law, and voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence (the other chamber of the Supreme Soviet, the Council of the Union, had been unable to work since December 12, 1991, when the recall of the Russian deputies left it without a quorum). The following day Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's former office, though the Russian authorities had taken over the suite two days earlier.

I can use this background: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\"  Now, I have a new situation: Michael and Robert are scientists who work in a nuclear reactor facility. Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time.  Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation.  Answer this question please: Who is less likely to experience internal organ failure? The answer to this question is:","output":"Robert is less likely to experience internal organ failure.  This conclusion is based on the description of the situation provided. Michael was exposed to high doses of radiation during the explosion that happened while he was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor. High doses of radiation are known to cause Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS). One of the effects of ARS is internal organ failure, which can be life-threatening.  On the other hand, Robert was in the adjacent room and was only exposed to low doses of radiation. Although any dose of radiation may increase the risk of cancer and genetic damage, the immediate effects of low-dose radiation exposure are generally less severe compared to high-dose exposure. Consequently, Robert's risk of experiencing internal organ failure due to the explosion would be lower than Michael's."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The development of quadraphonic records, including the two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records, SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui), was announced in 1971. These systems allowed the recording of four separate sound signals, which were combined into the main signal using electronic matrixing. When played, phase-detection circuits in amplifiers decoded the signals into four separate channels. QS (by Sansui) was among the initial quadraphonic systems developed during this period, whereas SACD (Super Audio CD) came to the scene much later. SACD was introduced by Sony and Philips in 1999 as a high-resolution audio format, offering a significantly improved audio quality compared to the standard CD. SACD is also capable of delivering multichannel audio, thus carrying forward some of the foundational aspects of quadraphonic systems. Quadraphonic records, despite being commercially unsuccessful, served as an important precursor to later surround-sound systems, such as SACD and home cinema, which are widely used today.

În cadrul întâlnirii de la Viena, liderii politici și reprezentanții statelor membre vor aborda probabil diverse aspecte legate de Constituția UE și modul în care aceasta poate fi îmbunătățită sau adaptată la nevoile și realitățile contextului actual. Un alt subiect cheie pe agenda întâlnirii este extinderea Uniunii Europene. Procesul de extindere implică aderarea unor noi țări la UE, în urma îndeplinirii unui set de criterii politice, economice și juridice, stabilite în Criteriile de la Copenhaga. Aceste criterii asigură că noile state membre sunt pregătite să se integreze în structura și mecanismele instituționale ale Uniunii, iar procesul de aderare se desfășoară în concordanță cu valorile, principiile și interesele comune ale tuturor statelor membre. În cadrul întâlnirii de la Viena, discuțiile despre extinderea UE vor aborda probabil chestiuni precum perspectivele de aderare ale unor țări candidate și potențiale candidate, evaluarea progreselor realizate de acestea în îndeplinirea criteriilor de la Copenhaga și necesitatea de a încuraja și sprijini reformele democratice și economice în respectivele țări. Printre alte probleme de pe agenda întâlnirii de la Viena, se pot număra și negocierile privind bugetul UE pe termen lung, mecanismele de solidaritate în gestionarea crizelor migratorii, consolidarea cooperării în domeniul securității și apărării, abordarea schimbărilor climatice, promovarea creșterii economice și crearea de locuri de muncă, și consolidarea relațiilor externe ale UE cu partenerii săi strategici. În concluzie, întâlnirea de la Viena va fi un prilej pentru liderii europeni și reprezentanții statelor membre să discute și să negocieze poziții comune și strategii privind Constituția UE, extinderea și alte probleme majore care influențează viitorul Uniunii și securitatea și prosperitatea cetățenilor săi.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose musical duties in Salonica were wide-ranging?, using the article: Holst was given a spectacular send-off. The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, \\"Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has given me a parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'.\\" There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: \\"it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use\\". He returned to England in June 1919., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The last name of the person whose musical duties in Salonica were wide-ranging is Holst. The article mentions that \\"Gustav Holst burst into my office...\\" and later states that Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica where his musical duties were wide-ranging.

What is the solution?","output":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step like we're talking to a five-year-old: We have an equation that says: 23 * a - 14 = -37 We want to find the value of \\"a.\\"  First, let's add 14 to both sides of the equation to move the 14 to the other side. When we do that, we get: 23 * a = -37 + 14 Now, let's simplify the right side of the equation. We know that -37 + 14 is equal to -23. So, our equation looks like this: 23 * a = -23 Now, to find the value of \\"a,\\" we just need to divide both sides of the equation by the number that's being multiplied by \\"a\\" (that's 23). So, we'll divide both sides by 23, like this: a = -23 / 23 Finally, when we divide -23 by 23, we get -1. So the solution is: a = -1 So, if we have 23 apples, and we take away 14 apples and 23 times of something, then that \\"something\\" must be -1 to get -37 apples."},{"instruction":"Given the following passage  \\"Several recent movies have been filmed in New Haven, including Mona Lisa Smile (2003), with Julia Roberts, The Life Before Her Eyes (2007), with Uma Thurman, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett and Shia LaBeouf.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.  Now, I have a new situation: Mike is studying the population growth rate of countries around the world. He noticed that countries like Japan and Russia are having a demographic shift. They have a growing population of late adulthood. He recorded the late adulthood population as population A. On the other hand, many developing countries have growing population of younger people. He recorded younger population as population B.  Answer this question please: Which population would less likley develop cardiovascular diseases, population A or population B? Answer:","output":"Population B (younger people) would be less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases.  Step 1: Understand the background information provided. The background information explains that during late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. It also mentions that most late adults experience declined strength and stamina and a weakened immune system. More late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Step 2: Consider the demographics of the two populations. Population A consists of individuals in late adulthood, while Population B consists of younger people. According to the background information, late adults face higher risks of several health issues, including cardiovascular diseases. Step 3: Compare the health risks of the two populations. Given that late adults are more prone to develop cardiovascular diseases, it can be inferred that younger individuals in Population B would be less likely to develop these diseases than those in Population A. Step 4: Confirm the answer. Based on the increased health risks faced by late adults as mentioned in the background information, we can conclude that Population B (younger people) would be less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases than Population A (late adults)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point. Question: How did the facebook exec try to justify the Ugly memo? Answer: A:","output":"The Facebook executive attempted to justify the Ugly Memo by stating that the company's core belief in connecting people outweighed any potential negative consequences. According to the memo, anything that allows Facebook to connect more people more often is considered *de facto* good, regardless of the possible outcomes, such as individuals being exposed to bullies, or terrorist attacks being coordinated through the platform's tools. The executive's main argument hinges on the idea that the overall benefits of connecting people surpass the risks and negative aspects that might arise as a result."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. I couldn't believe that this movie dates from 2007, it had all the looks of a below-average seventies horror-flick. Didn't they have any knowledge of modern special effects or CGI?!? Didn't they know that in the post-millennium the violence in a supposed horror- and/or scifi-movie should at least be a little bit graphic? Or did I get the purpose wrong, was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal, bound together in the big cycle of life, or a warning to mankind not to mess with Nature, or something like that?? It doesn't really matter, either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts. First of all: the premise is very improbable. If at a given time you're capable of replacing a total eye, no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time, that's totally unprofessional. And to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient?! And why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans, and make the victim look like a freak?! By the way, I noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy-like normal dark eyes, couldn't they have waited for such a specimen? The story is lame, it's about this poor guy Aaron who gets these weird eye-transplants, which suddenly makes him feel like the donor-wolf (or at least, that's what I make of it) and then he's being chased by some military men. Especially this last bit is ridiculous. I mean, I can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment (imagine soldiers with night-vision eye-sight!) but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient, it's beyond me why they're out to kill him. Why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient? (a volunteering soldier maybe??). And why try to kill everyone else that's involved with poor Aaron, isn't that a bit steep?! Who the hell are these militaries anyway, I hope not the US army or the government, they behave like psychopaths, walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons, raiding private apartments like they're after some public enemy # 1, and displaying during the ultimate show-down in the woods a total lack of discipline, like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren, panicking and shooting randomly around. Aaron, for some unfathomable medical reason, feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes. Why would that be??? He suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves. What is this? Are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor-wolf are situated in it's eye-balls?!? And that the recipient of these eye-balls also adopts the wolf's craving for red (life-) meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all-fours like a cat (can a wolf even DO that??!). The acting (or the lack thereof) didn't help the credibility of all this either: everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls, especially this Indian girl, she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression (vexed) and some disinterested mumblings about the force of Nature, and it beats me why Aaron all of a sudden is all over her (but hey, there probably had to be at least one love-scene!). I really sympathized with actor Cory Monteith, who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face, but they didn't give him much to go with. He has to run around bare-chested for more than half of the movie, which could have been fun to watch, but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique, Monteith really should leave his shirt on. His (few) killings and attacks are hardly shown, we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there's another victim lying down and Aaron with some more blood on his face and chest. Not much for a modern sci-fi horror! The only good acting came from Justine Bateman, and I really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty-something lady. She did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions, but they made her character a kind of a wimp, who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries. What a pity that the script didn't make her stand up a bit more!  In the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie, hardly scary or thrilling, with unbelievable goings-on, a lot of overlong National Geographic-like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes (who cares?!?), some pretentious Indian ramblings about Man and Nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments.

What is the name of the person who said Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Wagner, Mussorgsky, and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Colour lies at the heart of Messiaen's music. He believed that terms such as \\"tonal\\", \\"modal\\" and \\"serial\\" are misleading analytical conveniences. For him there were no modal, tonal or serial compositions, only music with or without colour. He said that Claudio Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Richard Wagner, Mussorgsky and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music.In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in the music (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the conductor in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he said that he did not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie (\\"Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong\\"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple (\\"gold and brown\\") to the highly detailed (\\"blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant\\").When asked what Messiaen's main influence had been on composers, George Benjamin said, \\"I think the sheer ... colour has been so influential, ... rather than being a decorative element, [Messiaen showed that colour] could be a structural, a fundamental element, ... the fundamental material of the music itself.\\" Answer:","output":"Olivier Messiaen"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After Tre gets in a fight at school, his teacher informs Reva that Tre is highly intelligent but has a volatile temper and lacks respect. Worried about Tre's future, Reva sends him to live in the Crenshaw neighborhood of South Central Los Angeles with his father, Furious Styles, from whom she hopes Tre will learn valuable life lessons. In Crenshaw, Tre reunites with his friends, Darrin \\"Doughboy\\" Baker, Doughboy's maternal half-brother Ricky, and Chris, their mutual friend. That night, Tre hears his father shooting at a burglar who tried to steal from the house. Two policemen arrive an hour later, and while the white officer is civil, the black officer treats Furious with disrespect and contempt. The next day, Tre and his friends go out with Chris who shows them a dead body. While there, a group of older Crip gang members steal Ricky's football and Doughboy aggressively tries to get it back but is easily defeated. While the boys walk away, one of the members gives Ricky back his ball and a frustrated Doughboy says he is going with Chris to the store. Later in the day, Furious spends quality time with Tre, taking him to the seaside for fishing and telling the boy more about his life story, including the time that he even went to Vietnam in hopes of making his boy proud of him. He concludes by advising Tre to not ever join the army, stating that the black man has no place in the army. While returning home, they see Doughboy and Chris getting arrested for stealing something at the store, while Ricky and Tre look on.The film then jumps forward to seven years later. At a backyard party, Doughboy is now a Crip and is celebrating his recent release from jail, along with most of his friends, including Chris, who is now in a wheelchair from a gunshot wound, and new friends Dooky and Monster, also Crips. Ricky, now a star running back for Crenshaw High School, lives with his mother Brenda, girlfriend Shanice, and their infant son. Tre has grown into a mature and responsible teenager, works at a clothing store at the local mall, and hopes to attend college with his girlfriend, Brandi.Furious takes Tre and Ricky to Compton to talk about the dangers of decreasing property values in the black community. That night, during a local street racing gathering, Ricky is provoked by Ferris, a member of the Bloods. In response, Doughboy brandishes his handgun, leading to a brief argument between the two gangs. While the two gangs were done arguing, Ferris shoots his gun in the air to signal everyone to leave. While Tre talks about leaving Los Angeles, he and Ricky are pulled over by the police. The lead officer, the same one who was disrespectful to Furious seven years earlier, deliberately intimidates and threatens Tre with his gun, knowing he can't do anything. Distraught, Tre goes to Brandi's house, where he finally breaks down. After she consoles him, they have sex for the first time.The next day, Ricky has a fight with Doughboy, with Brenda quickly taking Ricky's side and berating Doughboy. While Ricky and Tre walk to a nearby store, they see Ferris and his gang driving around the neighborhood and to avoid them, cut through back alleys and separate. Ferris's car closes in on Ricky, and one of Ferris's gang members guns Ricky down, killing him. Both Tre and Doughboy's gang catch up to the location of the shooting. Helpless, Tre and Doughboy carry Ricky's lifeless body back home. When Brenda and Shanice find out that Ricky is dead, they hysterically blame Doughboy, who unsuccessfully tries to comfort them. That night, Brenda sobs over Ricky's SAT results, discovering he scored just enough to qualify for the USC scholarship he wanted.The remaining boys vow vengeance on Ferris and his group. Furious finds Tre preparing to take Furious's revolver, but convinces Tre to abandon his plans for revenge. However, Brandi and Furious catch Tre sneaking out of his bedroom window to join Doughboy. That night, as the gang drives around the city, Tre asks to be let out of the car and returns home, realizing that his father was right to keep him from falling into a cycle of violence. When Tre gets back, Furious is waiting for him; they look at each other without saying a word, and then Furious retreats to his bedroom. Doughboy finds Ferris's gang at a local fast food restaurant, and Monster opens fire on them, killing one and wounding the other two. Doughboy gets out and personally executes the other wounded gang member and Ferris, avenging Ricky's death.The next day, Doughboy visits Tre, now understanding Tre's reasons for abandoning the gang. Doughboy knows that he will soon face retaliation for Ferris' death, and accepts the consequences of his crime-ridden life. He plaintively questions why America \\"don't know, don't show, or don't care about what's going on in the hood\\". He sorrowfully says that he has no brothers left now after Ricky's death, but is embraced by Tre, who says to Doughboy \\"You still got one brother left.\\"The epilogue reveals that Doughboy saw Ricky buried the next day and was murdered two weeks later. Tre and Brandi resume their relationship, and go on to attend Morehouse and Spelman Colleges in Atlanta, respectively.

Now, the queen bee is like the mommy bee of the hive while the worker bees are like her helpers, and the drone bees are a bit like dads. To find the queen bee, you need to watch how the other bees act around her. When the worker bees are near the queen bee, they will form a sort of circle around her, like a group of friends hanging out together on the playground. They do this to protect their queen and to show that she's very special. The drone bees, on the other hand, don't hang around the queen as much. They'll be more spread out, as if they are searching for flowers to get food from. So, to find the queen bee, look for a bee with a bigger body and longer tail, surrounded by lots of worker bees in a circle.

At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing..., can you guess it ?

Input: Abstract: BACKGROUND Screening for cervical cancer based on testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) increases the sensitivity of detection of high-grade (grade 2 or 3) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, but whether this gain represents overdiagnosis or protection against future high-grade cervical epithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer is unknown.     METHODS In a population-based screening program in Sweden, 12,527 women 32 to 38 years of age were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to have an HPV test plus a Papanicolaou (Pap) test (intervention group) or a Pap test alone (control group). Women with a positive HPV test and a normal Pap test result were offered a second HPV test at least 1 year later, and those who were found to be persistently infected with the same high-risk type of HPV were then offered colposcopy with cervical biopsy. A similar number of double-blinded Pap smears and colposcopies with biopsy were performed in randomly selected women in the control group. Comprehensive registry data were used to follow the women for a mean of 4.1 years. The relative rates of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer detected at enrollment and at subsequent screening examinations were calculated.     RESULTS At enrollment, the proportion of women in the intervention group who were found to have lesions of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer was 51% greater (95% confidence interval [CI], 13 to 102) than the proportion of women in the control group who were found to have such lesions. At subsequent screening examinations, the proportion of women in the intervention group who were found to have grade 2 or 3 lesions or cancer was 42% less (95% CI, 4 to 64) and the proportion with grade 3 lesions or cancer was 47% less (95% CI, 2 to 71) than the proportions of control women who were found to have such lesions. Women with persistent HPV infection remained at high risk for grade 2 or 3 lesions or cancer after referral for colposcopy.     CONCLUSIONS The addition of an HPV test to the Pap test to screen women in their mid-30s for cervical cancer reduces the incidence of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer detected by subsequent screening examinations.

However, the second statement says that there are only two dogs in the photo. This creates a discrepancy between the two statements, making it impossible to logically conclude that the original statement is accurate based on the information provided. In order for the original statement to make sense in the context of the second statement, it would need to be modified to account for the fact that there are only two dogs in the photo. Here are some potential revised statements: 1. If there are only two dogs in the photo, one could say, \\"There are two dogs in the photo: a dog on the grass in the distance and a black dog on the grass in the forefront.\\" This statement accurately reflects the number of dogs in the photo and provides a clear description of their positions in the scene. 2. Alternatively, the statement could be revised to read, \\"There are two dogs on the grass in the distance, and a black dog on the grass in the forefront,\\" This would still imply that there are only two dogs present in the photo, but it would place both dogs in the distance rather than in a circle. 3. Another possible revision might be, \\"Two dogs are visible in the photo: a dog on the grass in the distance and a black dog on the grass in the forefront.\\" The revised statement would be more clearly based on the restriction of having only two dogs present in the photo. However, please note that none of these revised statements reflect the original statement's imagery, which includes four dogs in a circle in the distance and a black dog in the forefront. The discrepancy between the number of dogs in the two statements means that one cannot logically conclude the original statement based on the information provided.

CHAPTER IX  THE FOOTBALL MEETING  In a few days Dave felt as much at home as ever. Nearly all of his old friends had returned to Oak Hall, and dormitories Nos. 11 and 12 were filled with as bright a crowd of lads as could well be found anywhere. In the number were Gus Plum and Chip Macklin, but the former was no longer the bully as of old, and the latter had lost his toadying manner, and was quite manly, and the other students treated them as if all had always been the best of friends.  It did Dave's heart good to see the change in Plum, and he was likewise pleased over the different way in which Macklin acted.  \\"I never thought it was in Gus and Chip,\\" he said, privately, to Roger. \\"It shows what a fellow can do if he sets his mind to it.\\"  \\"It's to your credit as much as to their own,\\" declared the senator's son. \\"I don't believe Gus would have reformed if you hadn't braced him up.\\"  \\"I wish I could reform Nat Poole.\\"  \\"You'll never do it, Dave--but you may scare him into behaving himself.\\"  \\"Have you met Guy Frapley, Roger--I mean to talk to?\\"  \\"Yes, in the gym., where Phil and I were practicing with the Indian clubs.\\"  \\"What do you think of him?\\"  \\"I think he is fairly aching to become the leader of the school.

Once upon a time I had a dog named Toodles. He was black and white and had long floppy ears. He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better.

Information:  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - Biological Physics: Energy, Information, Life: With new art by David Goodsell is a book by Philip Nelson, illustrated by David Goodsell. This printing, the fifth, is published by W. H. Freeman in late 2013. It is a work on biology with an emphasis on the application of physical principles.  - The Max Delbruck Prize, formerly known as the Biological physics prize, is awarded by the Division of Biological Physics of the American Physical Society, to recognize and encourage outstanding achievement in biological physics research. The prize was established in 1981, and renamed for Max Delbrück in 2006. The award consists of 10,000, an allowance for travel to the meeting where the prize is awarded, and a certificate. It was presented biennially in even-numbered years until 2014, and will be presented annually starting 2015.   - Biophysics or biological physics is an interdisciplinary science that applies the approaches and methods of physics to study biological systems. Biophysics covers all scales of biological organization, from molecular to organismic and populations. Biophysical research shares significant overlap with biochemistry, physical chemistry, nanotechnology, bioengineering, computational biology, biomechanics and systems biology.  - The Biophysical Society is an international scientific society that exists to encourage the development and dissemination of knowledge in biophysics. Founded in 1958, the society currently consists of over 9,000 researchers in academia, government, and industry.

While consulting for the United States government through JASON , Block has researched the many threats associated with bioterrorism and headed influential studies on how advances in genetic engineering have impacted biological warfare .  - The Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States. The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group beyond the sports context. The eight institutions are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. The term \\"Ivy League\\" has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.  - The American Institute of Physics (AIP) promotes science, the profession of physics, publishes physics journals, and produces publications for scientific and engineering societies. The AIP is made up of various member societies. Its corporate headquarters are at the American Center for Physics in College Park, Maryland, but the institute also has offices in Melville, New York and Beijing.  - Industry is the production of goods or related services within an economy. The major source of revenue of a group or company is the indicator of its relevant industry. When a large group has multiple sources of revenue generation, it is considered to be working in different industries. Manufacturing industry became a key sector of production and labour in European and North American countries during the Industrial Revolution, upsetting previous mercantile and feudal economies. This came through many successive rapid advances in technology, such as the production of steel and coal.  - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations. Located at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula, San Francisco is about in area, making it the smallest countyand the only consolidated city-countywithin the state of California. With a density of about 18,451 people per square mile (7,124 people per km), San Francisco is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City. San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, and the 13th-most populous city in the United Stateswith a census-estimated 2015 population of 864,816. The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, and are a part of the larger OMB-designated San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 8.7 million.  - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America.  - In biology, motility is the ability to move spontaneously and actively, consuming energy in the process. Motility is genetically determined (see genetic determinism) but may be affected by environmental factors. For instance, muscles give animals motility but the consumption of hydrogen cyanide (the environmental factor in this case) would adversely affect muscle physiology causing them to stiffen leading to rigor mortis. Most animals are motile but the term applies to unicellular and simple multicellular organisms, as well as to some mechanisms of fluid flow in multicellular organs, in addition to animal locomotion. Motile marine animals are commonly called free-swimming.  - Physical Review is an American peer-reviewed scientific journal established in 1893 by Edward Nichols. It publishes original research as well as scientific and literature reviews on all aspects of physics. It is published by the American Physical Society (APS). The journal is in its third series, and is split in several sub-journals each covering a particular field of physics. It has a sister journal, \\"Physical Review Letters\\", which publishes shorter articles of broader interest.  - Henry Augustus Rowland (November 27, 1848  April 16, 1901) was an American physicist.

October 19] 1735  July 4, 1826) was an American patriot who served as the second President of the United States (17971801) and the first Vice President (178997). He was a lawyer, diplomat, statesman, political theorist, and, as a Founding Father, a leader of the movement for American independence from Great Britain. He was also a dedicated diarist and correspondent, particularly with his wife and closest advisor Abigail.  - The American Physical Society (APS) is the world's second largest organization of physicists. The Society publishes more than a dozen scientific journals, including the prestigious \\"Physical Review\\" and \\"Physical Review Letters\\", and organizes more than twenty science meetings each year. APS is a member society of the American Institute of Physics.  - The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States of America. The Constitution, originally comprising seven articles, delineates the national frame of government. Its first three articles entrench the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress; the executive, consisting of the President; and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts. Articles Four, Five and Six entrench concepts of federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments and of the states in relationship to the federal government. Article Seven establishes the procedure subsequently used by the thirteen States to ratify it.  - Edwin Herbert Land, ForMemRS, FRPS, Hon.MRI (May 7, 1909  March 1, 1991) was an American scientist and inventor, best known as the co-founder of the Polaroid Corporation. Among other things, he invented inexpensive filters for polarizing light, a practical system of in-camera instant photography, and his retinex theory of color vision. His Polaroid instant camera, which went on sale in late 1948, made it possible for a picture to be taken and developed in 60 seconds or less.  - Physical Review Letters (PRL), established in 1958, is a peer-reviewed, scientific journal that is published 52 times per year by the American Physical Society. As also confirmed by various measurement standards, which include the \\"Journal Citation Reports\\" impact factor and the journal h-index proposed by Google Scholar, many physicists and other scientists consider \\"Physical Review Letters\\" one of the most prestigious journals in the field of physics.  - James Bowdoin II (August 7, 1726  November 6, 1790) was an American political and intellectual leader from Boston, Massachusetts, during the American Revolution and the following decade. He initially gained fame and influence as a wealthy merchant. He served in both branches of the Massachusetts General Court from the 1750s to the 1770s. Although he was initially supportive of the royal governors, he opposed British colonial policy and eventually became an influential advocate of independence. He authored a highly political report on the 1770 Boston Massacre that has been described by historian Francis Walett as one of the most influential pieces of writing that shaped public opinion in the colonies.  - Howard Curtis Berg (born 1934) is the Herchel Smith Professor of Physics and Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard University, where he teaches biophysics and studies the motility of the bacterium \\"Escherichia coli (E. coli)\\".  - The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, frequently known as the American Academy, is one of the oldest and most prestigious honorary societies and a leading center for policy research in the United States. Election to the Academy is considered one of the nation's highest honors since its founding during the American Revolution by John Adams, John Hancock, James Bowdoin, and other scholar-patriots who contributed prominently to the establishment of the new nation, its government, and the United States Constitution.  - Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, established in 1636, whose history, influence, and wealth have made it one of the world's most prestigious universities.  - Princeton University is a private Ivy League research university in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.  - John Hancock (October 8, 1793) was an American merchant, statesman, and prominent Patriot of the American Revolution. He served as president of the Second Continental Congress and was the first and third Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is remembered for his large and stylish signature on the United States Declaration of Independence, so much so that the term \\"John Hancock\\" has become, in the United States, a synonym for a signature.  - Max Ludwig Henning Delbrück, ForMemRS (September 4, 1906  March 9, 1981), a GermanAmerican biophysicist, helped launch the molecular biology research program in the late 1930s. He stimulated physical scientists' interest into biology, especially as to basic research to physically explain genes, mysterious at the time. Formed in 1945 and led by Delbrück along with Salvador Luria and Alfred Hershey, the Phage Group made substantial headway unraveling important aspects of genetics. The three shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \\"for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses\\". He was the first physicist to predict what is now called Delbrück scattering.  - Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University, is a private research university in Stanford, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and between San Jose and San Francisco.

This peaceful town is disrupted when a mysterious young woman, Jane, arrives claiming to have visions. She claims to see the past, future, and most disturbingly, spirits who have passed on, trapped between our world and the next. She retells stories of the town's history, enchanting and terrifying its residents, as her visions reveal secrets that were supposed to stay buried. But her most significant vision is yet to come. One day, she predicts a tragedy: a massive fire engulfing the town church. The prediction comes true, making the terrified townspeople start believing in the supernatural.  As the plot progresses, Jane's visions become darker and grimmer. She starts seeing demonic entities, not just spirits. These entities, disguised as familiar townspeople, visit her visions and starts tempting humans into committing heinous acts, such as betrayals, murders, and acts of violence. At first, the townspeople start succumbing to these temptations, seeing them as divine tests or punishments. Families turn against each other, friends betray those they once trusted, and chaos runs rampant. The tranquility of Kinsley's End is shattered, and police, torn between logic and public hysteria, are clueless. The town pastor, Father Williams, a skeptical but wise man, realizes that Jane's trance-like states, when she communicates with these entities, resemble cases of demonic possessions he's read about in esoteric texts. After witnessing such a session, he comes to the conclusion that Jane is not merely a psychic - she is an unwilling conduit through whom demonic entities are accessing humans. Father Williams confronts Jane and convinces her of the terrifying truth. Unequipped to deal with the situation themselves, they seek the help of renowned exorcist, Sister Abigail, who immediately recognizes the signs of an attempted demonic invasion.  The rest of the plot then revolves around Jane, Father Williams, and Sister Abigail's desperate fight to save the town and Jane herself. They devise a plan to trick the demonic entities during one of Jane's visions, using religious rites and talismans. As the culmination, a grand exorcism takes place in the heart of the flaming town church witnessed by the townspeople. Amidst prayers, chants, and raw fear, Jane bravely battles the malicious entities in a spiritual showdown. In the end, Jane and Father Williams manage to banish the demonic entities from our world, restoring peace in Kinsley's End. The experience leaves the town scarred but stronger as they reunite and rebuild their beloved town. \\"Through the Glass Darkly\\" becomes a thrilling exploration of the age-old battle between good and evil, the power of belief, the strength of community, and a chilling reminder of the dark side of the spiritual world living among us."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Use a butter knife or similar tool, like popsicle sticks or a spatula. Add just enough wax to lightly cover the target area. As you do, spread the wax down in the direction that your hair grows. For example, with your calf, spread it from your knee down to your ankle, not the other way.  With each application, apply it in a fast, clean motion in order to spread it as thinly as possible. Dragging it too slowly over your skin may result in thicker deposits, which will be tougher to remove. This may take some practice, so consider making an extra batch just in case you mess up. Use cotton muslin strips of an appropriate size for the area you’re waxing, or slightly larger. Set it over the wax, with at least a couple inches (about 5 cm) remaining clear of the wax at one end, so you have a tab that’s easy to pull. Then gently rub the portion that’s stuck to the wax in the same direction that your hair grows, without pressing directly down into your flesh. Do this two or three times.   Alternately, you can cut up an old t-shirt or other cloth and use strips of that. If you do, just make sure the material isn’t too stretchy. You want something nice and firm for easy removal. The free end should be in the direction of your hair growth. For example, with your calf, it should be pointing toward your ankle, not your knee. With one hand, use your fingers to pull the surrounding skin away from the fabric, so it’s nice and taut. Then, with the other, take the fabric’s free end in between your fingertips. Quickly pull the fabric free of your skin in the opposite direction that your hair grows.   For example, with your calf, you should pull the strip up toward your knee. As you do, try to keep as straight as possible. Avoid pulling it off at an angle that’s different from the one in which it was applied. Tear it off like a bandaid, in one quick, clean motion. Apply more wax and strips as needed to wax all of the intended area. Depending on how large an area you’re waxing, reheat the mixture if it cools off or hardens to the point that you can’t spread it easily. Once you’re done, wash your skin with warm to hot water.   If needed, apply more wax to the same area and use a second strip. After that, use a tweezer to pluck any remaining hairs. Your skin will probably be too sensitive for a third waxing.  Use soap if you want when washing, but it isn’t necessary. All you need is warm water, so stick with that if you used scented oil and want the smell to last.

Sentence 2: Sicha described it as '' night-active and ... seemingly seriously huge , organic \`\` -- in fact around the clock . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"While these two sentences are quite similar in structure and content, they do have minor differences that could affect the interpretation of the information being conveyed. Let's break down each sentence and compare their elements. Sentence 1:  \\"Sicha described it as 'nocturnal and ... seemingly seriously huge, organic' -- in fact, active around the clock.\\" Sentence 2: \\"Sicha described it as '' night-active and ... seemingly seriously huge , organic \`\` -- in fact around the clock .\\" Here are the main differences between the two sentences: 1. Word Choice: The first sentence uses the term \\"nocturnal,\\" which specifically means active during the nighttime, while the second sentence replaces it with \\"night-active.\\" Although both descriptions refer to activity at night, \\"nocturnal\\" is a more widely used term and has a more precise meaning in comparison to \\"night-active.\\" 2. Placement of \\"in fact\\": In Sentence 1, \\"in fact\\" is followed by \\"active around the clock,\\" whereas, in Sentence 2, \\"in fact\\" is placed right before \\"around the clock\\" without additional words in between. This change slightly alters the emphasis of the sentence and may suggest that \\"in fact around the clock\\" is meant to further illustrate the concept of \\"seemingly seriously huge, organic\\" in Sentence 2. In Sentence 1, \\"in fact, active around the clock\\" seems to be an additional detail provided to describe the subject. Despite these differences, both sentences generally convey the same idea: Sicha is describing something as being night-oriented, exceptionally large, and organic in nature, and it is active 24/7. However, the subtle differences in word choice and phrasing might impact the way a reader interprets each sentence.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Glenn Martin Christopher Francis Quinn is an Irish actor known for playing a half-demon, half-angel.","output":"While it's true that Glenn Martin Christopher Francis Quinn was an Irish actor and he did play a half-demon, the latter part of the sentence in question is not accurate. While the character Doyle, whom Quinn played on \\"Angel\\", was indeed half-demon, there is no information provided that suggests the character was also half-angel. Instead, \\"Angel\\" is a spin-off series of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", and the series itself is centered around a character named Angel who is a vampire cursed with a soul.  Quinn's depiction of Doyle was significant because this character was introduced as part of a supernatural world, similar to, yet vastly different from the one established in \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\". Doyle's character was marked by his half-demon nature, but there was no mention or implication that he was half-angel. In \\"Angel\\", Doyle's character possesses some psychic abilities, such as visions of people in danger, a trait which he inherited from his half-demon heritage. These visions were instrumental in guiding the actions of the main character, Angel. Despite his supernatural heritage and abilities, Doyle struggled with accepting his demon side, often manifesting internal conflict, indicative of the complex nature of his character. Nonetheless, there is no suggestion in the series or elsewhere in Quinn's acting career that he portrayed a character who was half-angel. Therefore, it is not accurate to state that Glenn Martin Christopher Francis Quinn is an Irish actor known for playing a half-demon, half-angel.

Gustaf V was born in Drottningholm Palace in Ekero, Stockholm County, the son of Prince Oscar and Princess Sofia of Nassau. At birth Gustaf was created Duke of Varmland. Upon his father's accession to the throne in 1872, Gustaf became crown prince of both Sweden and Norway. On 8 December 1907, he succeeded his father on the Swedish throne, which had been separated from the Norwegian throne two years earlier. When he ascended the throne, Gustaf V was, at least on paper, a near-autocrat. The 1809 Instrument of Government made the king both head of state and head of government, and ministers were solely responsible to him. However, his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament in 1905. Since then, prime ministers had been chosen according to parliamentary support.  At first, Gustaf V seemed to be willing to accept parliamentary rule. After the Liberals won a massive landslide in 1911, Gustaf appointed Liberal leader Karl Staaff as Prime Minister. However, during the runup to World War I, the elites objected to Staaff's defence policy. In February 1914, a large crowd of farmers gathered at the royal palace and demanded that the country's defences be strengthened. In his reply, the so-called Courtyard Speech--which was actually written by explorer Sven Hedin, an ardent conservative--Gustaf promised to strengthen the country's defences. Staaff was outraged, telling the king parliamentary rule called for the Crown to stay out of partisan politics. He was also angered that he had not been consulted in advance of the speech. However, Gustaf retorted that he still had the right to \\"communicate freely with the Swedish people.\\" The Staaff government resigned in protest, and Gustaf appointed a government of civil servants headed by Hjalmar Hammarskjold (father of Dag Hammarskjold) in its place. To date, it is the last time that a Swedish king directly intervened in the governing of the country.  The 1917 elections showed a heavy gain for the Liberals and Social Democrats. Despite this, Gustaf initially tried to appoint a Conservative government headed by Johan Widen. However, Widen was unable to form a coalition. It was now apparent that Gustaf could no longer appoint a government entirely of his own choosing, nor could he keep a government in office against the will of Parliament. With no choice but to appoint a Liberal as prime minister, he appointed a Liberal-Social Democratic coalition government headed by Staaff's successor as Liberal leader, Nils Eden. The Eden government promptly arrogated most of the king's political powers to itself and enacted numerous reforms, most notably the institution of complete (male and female) universal suffrage in 1918-1919. While Gustaf still formally appointed the ministers, they now had to have the confidence of Parliament. He was now also bound to act on the ministers' advice. Although the provision in the Instrument of Government stating that \\"the King alone shall govern the realm\\" remained unchanged, for all intents and purposes the ministers did the actual governing. Gustaf accepted his reduced role, and reigned for the rest of his life as a model limited constitutional monarch. Parliamentarianism had become a de facto reality in Sweden, even if it would not be formalized until 1974.  Gustaf V was considered to have German sympathies during World War I. His political stance during the war was highly influenced by his wife, who felt a strong connection to her German homeland. On 18 December 1914, he sponsored a meeting in Malmo with the other two kings of Scandinavia to demonstrate unity. Another of Gustaf V's objectives was to dispel suspicions that he wanted to bring Sweden into the war on Germany's side.

Answer the following question: Stan Lawson is a biologist who studies marine life and has been keeping hand written notes for many years on experiments that he has performed. Jack Smith is an inventor and engineer who wants to create a new type of plastic companies can use that won't harm the ocean. They are considering joining together to work on this new venture.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person would provide the technological knowledge used to create the new product, Stan Lawson or Jack Smith?  Hint: The Hubble space telescope shows that technology and science are closely related. Technology uses science to solve problems, and science uses technology to make new discoveries. However, technology and science have different goals. The goal of science is to answer questions and increase knowledge. The goal of technology is to find solutions to practical problems. Although they have different goals, science and technology work hand in hand, and each helps the other advance. Scientific knowledge is used to create new technologies such as the space telescope. New technologies often allow scientists to explore nature in new ways. Answer:","output":"Given the information provided, Jack Smith would be the person to provide the technological knowledge used to create the new product. This is because Jack is described as an inventor and engineer, which implies that his expertise is in the development and application of technology.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","output":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. Let me elaborate on the process of acid rain formation and how the supposed perturbation fits in: 1. Chemicals like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the air, mainly due to human activities like burning fossil fuels in power plants, vehicles, and industrial processes. 2. These substances rise into the high atmosphere and get dispersed over large areas. 3. SO2 and NOx react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). 4. These acidic particles are then incorporated into cloud droplets or exist as fine particulate matter (aerosols). 5. The rain with high acid content falls back to the earth's surface, damaging ecosystems, infrastructure, and materials. In the scenario you mentioned, if there are more clouds and more \\"bumping around\\" (which could mean increased turbulence or disturbance in the atmosphere), it might lead to slightly different dispersion rates, increased interaction among the cloud droplets, or a possible increase in the formation of acid particles. However, it does not have a direct impact on the chemical reactions themselves. The \\"bumping around\\" indirectly impacts a step of the process, as it does not change the overall mechanism of acid rain formation but may alter the rate or spatial distribution due to increased cloud movement or interaction. This perturbation can result in varying levels of acid rain intensity or the extent of the affected area, but it does not fundamentally change the process of acid rain formation."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer choices: - acid  - energy  - phosphorous  - pollution  - oxygen  - photons  - water  - rain The answer to this question is:","output":"Plants will die without several of these elements and conditions, as they each play a vital role in their growth, development, and overall survival. Here is a detailed explanation for each of the answer choices: 1. Acid: Most plants require a balanced soil pH for proper growth. However, they do not directly need acid to survive. Some plants, such as acid-loving plants, grow better in a more acidic environment, but they will not necessarily die without it. 2. Energy: Plants need energy to carry out essential processes like photosynthesis, respiration, growth, and reproduction. They obtain this energy through sunlight, which provides the input for photosynthesis. If plants do not receive sufficient energy or sunlight, they will ultimately die. 3. Phosphorous: Phosphorus is an essential macronutrient that plants need for the formation of vital molecules like ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and DNA. It also plays a crucial role in root development and flower and seed production. If plants lack phosphorus, they may experience stunted growth and reduced yields, which can eventually lead to their death. 4. Pollution: Plants do not need pollution to survive; in fact, pollution is generally harmful to plant life. Air pollution can cause leaf damage and reduce photosynthesis, while soil and water pollution can lead to nutrient imbalances, contamination, and death. 5. Oxygen: Oxygen is vital for plant respiration, where plant cells break down sugars and produce energy. This process occurs in the mitochondria of the plant cells and is essential for their survival. If oxygen is not present, plants will be unable to generate the energy they need for growth, maintenance, and reproduction, ultimately leading to their death. 6. Photons: Plants require photons, which are particles of light, to perform photosynthesis, the process through which they convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose (a form of energy) and oxygen. Without photons or available light, photosynthesis cannot occur, and plants will eventually die due to a lack of energy resources. 7. Water: As mentioned in the question, plants will die without water. Water is necessary for photosynthesis, nutrient transport, and turgor maintenance in the cells. A lack of water can lead to wilting and, eventually, death. 8. Rain: Rain provides water for plants, and without rain, plants in certain environments might not receive enough water. However, plants can survive utilizing other water sources and methods like irrigation or collecting dew. So, although rain is important for many plants, they do not die solely from a lack of rain. In summary, plants will die without energy, oxygen, phosphorous, photons, and water, as these are crucial for their physiological processes, growth, and development. Acid, pollution, and rain pertain to specific environmental conditions and can influence plant health, but plants do not directly depend on them to survive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When a tornado touched down in a small town nearby, many families were left completely destroyed. Afterward all the local newspapers carried many human-interest stories featuring some of the families who suffered the hardest. One Sunday, a particular picture especially touched me. A young woman stood in front of an entirely shattered mobile home, a depressed expression twisting her features. A young boy, seven or eight years old, stood at her side, eyes downcast. Clutching     at her skirt was a tiny girl who stared into the camera, eyes wide with confusion and fear. The article that went with the picture gave the clothing sizes of each family member. With growing interest, I noticed that their sizes closely matched ours. This would be a good opportunity to teach my children to help those less fortunate than themselves. I taped the picture of the young family to our refrigerator, explaining their difficulty to my seven-year-old twins, Brad and Brett, and to three- year-old Meghan. \\" We have so much. And these poor people now have nothing,\\" I said.\\"We'll share what we have with them.\\" I brought three large boxes down from the room upstairs and placed them on the living room floor. Meghan watched seriously, as the boys and I filled one of the boxes with canned goods and foods.

Meghan watched quietly as the boys piled up discarded toys and games. \\"I'll help you find something for the little girl when I'm done with this,\\" I said. The boys placed the toys they had chosen to donate into one of the boxes while I filled the third box with clothes. Meghan walked up with Lucy, her worn, faded, much-loved rag doll hugged tightly to her chest. She paused in front of the box that held the toys, pressed her round little face into Lucy's flat, painted-on-face, gave her a final kiss, then laid her gently on top of the other toys. \\"Oh, Honey,\\" I said.\\"You don't have to give Lucy.

Albrecht Durer (/'dU@r@r, 'djU@r@r/; German: ['albRect 'dy:Ra]; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) was a painter, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.

(AP) – Several more national retailers have joined Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in pulling a batch of powdered infant formula from their shelves after a Missouri newborn who consumed it apparently died of a rare bacterial infection. Officials at Supervalu Inc., Walgreen Co., Kroger Co. and Safeway said Friday they have removed cans of Enfamil Newborn with the lot number ZP1K7G from various stores across the country. They say it's a precaution until health officials complete tests on the formula. Ten-day-old Avery Cornett died Sunday after getting sick several days earlier. Preliminary hospital tests indicated he died of a rare infection caused by bacteria known as Cronobacter sakazakii. The source of the bacteria that caused the infection hasn't been determined, but it can be found in dried milk and powdered formula. Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Article: Long bus rides are like television shows. They have a beginning, a middle, and an end with commercials   thrown in every three or four minutes. The commercials are unavoidable. They happen whether you want them or not. Every couple of minutes a billboard glides by outside the bus window. \\"Buy Super Clean Toothpaste.\\" \\"Drink Good Wet Root Beer.\\" \\"Fill up with Pacific Gas. \\"Only when you have fallen asleep, which is equal to turning the television set off, can you get separated from the unending cry of \\"You Need It! Buy It Now!\\" As for the ride itself, the beginning of it is comfortable and somewhat exciting, even if you've traveled that way before. Usually some things are keeping changing out of the windows -- various houses, crop fields, attractive bridges, ... and sometimes even a small accident. Your bus driver may have a unique style of driving and it's fun trying experience it the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly reckless   or daring, the ride can be as thrilling   as an adventurous story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left hand lane? After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you've got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops. The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning. You know the riding will soon be over and there's a kind of expectation and excitement with that. The seat, of course, has become harder for the hours having passed. By now you may sit with your legs crossed, or with your hands in your lap, or with your hands on the arms, or even with your hands crossed behind your head. That is to say that the end comes just at no more ways to sit. Question: The writer feels long bus rides are like TV shows because   _  .

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Remove all unnecessary objects from the room. Cover bathtubs, counters, mirrors, and other fixtures with a drop cloth to protect them from flying pieces of tile. Carefully cover any drains with painter’s tape. Lay down drop cloth over any part of the floor you plan to keep as well. For hygienic reasons, clean the bathroom thoroughly before you continue. . If the toilet (or a pedestal sink) is covering the tile, turn off the shutoff valve on the water supply line. Flush the toilet until the tank and bowl are both dry, finishing the job with a hand-operated pump, then a sponge. Detach the tank using a wrench. Set the tank and the toilet aside on old towels or other absorbent materials.  Leave the tank and bowl attached, and remove both at once. You may need to rock the toilet back and forth to break the caulk, or cut away the caulk with a utility knife. Carefully remove the wax ring that creates a seal between the base of the toilet and the drainage pipe. You may wish to wear gloves during this process, since the wax ring is very sticky. Clean any remaining wax off the base of the toilet with a rag soaked in mineral spirits. You will need to replace the wax ring with a new one when you re-install the toilet. Consider retrofitting your toilet with a wax ring that comes with an extension to accommodate higher flanges. After removing the toilet, plug the hole with a rag to block sewer gases. Wear heavy-duty gloves, wraparound safety goggles, and long sleeves to protect yourself from sharp tile pieces. Wear a dust mask to protect against dust from pulverized tile. You should also wear work pants, a hat, and work boots.  Ceramic tiles and mortar commonly contained asbestos until the 1980s in the US, and the 1990s in some regions.Test old tiles and mortar for asbestos and, if asbestos is found, hire a professional to remove the tiles safely. Even modern tiles often use lead glaze, which creates lead dust during removal. One tile removal project is unlikely to cause dangerous exposure, but to be on the safe side, ventilate the bathroom to the outside, and wash skin and clothes after completing the project. Buy a respirator mask rated for lead dust if you expect repeat exposure. Use a cold chisel and sledgehammer to break apart one tile, and deposit the pieces into a bucket. This will give you a look at the subsurface, which can help determine your approach. Read through the rest of this section before you decide how to continue. If you want to preserve as many tiles intact as possible — which is difficult and time-consuming — first cover the center of the tile with masking tape and drill several holes through it with a carbide-tipped drill bit. This will reduce the number of flying pieces that can chip nearby tiles. If the material beneath the tiles is in good condition, you can save yourself some money and leave it intact. That said, this method is slow and often causes some damage to the substrate; use your best judgement. Remove the tiles with a flat pry bar, placing the edge low against the side of the tile and striking the base of the knife with a hammer. An electric chisel is another option. Periodically scrape adhesive off the exposed floor with a putty knife or a floor scraper.  If the tile only breaks in tiny pieces, or if you want to maximize the chance that the tile comes out intact, scrape out the grout lines around the tile first. You may use a handheld grout saw, a carbide blade fitted onto a rotary grinder or oscillating tool, or (less effectively) a utility knife with several spare blades.  A little heat from a blow dryer or heat gun may soften the grout. Chip away a row of tiles to expose this substrate. Fit a reciprocating saw with a long blade (wood-cutting or carbide-tipped masonry cutting, depending on the material). Cut into the side of the substrate at a low angle, making a long cut to free it from the floor beneath. You can now lift the material and tile up in chunks with a flat bar. Cutting through cement board may damage the floor beneath, and roofing nails may interrupt your progress. A safer, but slower alternative is to break through the cement board with a hammer. You can then pry the cement board off the floor beneath using a pry bar. Floor tiles from the 1960s and earlier were often installed on a thick mortar bed. Mortar beds were typically installed in areas where the floor was sloped for drainage, e.g., in shower areas. This is a pain to remove, but chiseling out the tiles is slow and will likely cause cracks in the mortar anyway, so it's best to replace it now if you can afford it. Here's how to remove it:  Most mortar beds are made of sand mixed with a small quantity of Portland cement, and are not particularly difficult to break up. Shut off the house's main water valve before you begin. Removing the mortar bed may damage a water pipe. Break through a small area with a chisel and sledge to the surface beneath (usually wood). Using a rotary hammer with a chisel bit (from a tool rental company), chisel around a chunk of mortar about 1 foot (0.3 m) across. Use caution when approaching the base of the bed. Complete the job by using the hammer between the wood and the mortar bed, periodically chiseling the mortar from above.

Passage: Glia While glia are often thought of as the supporting cast of the nervous system, the number of glial cells in the brain actually outnumbers the number of neurons by a factor of ten. Neurons would be unable to function without the vital roles that are fulfilled by these glial cells. Glia guide developing neurons to their destinations, buffer ions and chemicals that would otherwise harm neurons, and provide myelin sheaths around axons. Scientists have recently discovered that they also play a role in responding to nerve activity and modulating communication between nerve cells. When glia do not function properly, the result can be disastrous—most brain tumors are caused by mutations in glia. Types of Glia There are several different types of glia with different functions, two of which are shown in Figure 35.7. Astrocytes, shown in Figure 35.8a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS. They provide nutrients and other substances to neurons, regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid, and provide structural support for synapses. Astrocytes also form the blood-brain barrier—a structure that blocks entrance of toxic substances into the brain. Astrocytes, in particular, have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity, transmit calcium waves between astrocytes, and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses. Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS. Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms. Oligodendrocytes, shown in Figure 35.8b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS. One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes, and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons. This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon. Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations. Ependymal cells line fluid-filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. They are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid, which serves as a cushion for the brain, moves the fluid between the spinal cord and the brain, and is a component for the choroid plexus. Answer: neurons Output:","output":"Part #1: Identify the key subject in the passage. Usage: The key subject is glial cells and their relationship to neurons. The passage discusses the various functions of glial cells and how they support neurons in the nervous system. Part #2: Find the context of the answer in the passage. Usage: In this passage, the context of the answer \\"neurons\\" is found in the line \\"the number of glial cells in the brain actually outnumbers the number of neurons by a factor of ten.\\" This means that there are ten times more glial cells than neurons in the brain. Part #3: Determine the relevant information related to the answer. Usage: The relevant information related to the answer \\"neurons\\" is that they are unable to function without the support of glial cells. Glial cells play vital roles in guiding developing neurons, buffering ions and chemicals, providing myelin sheaths, and modulating communication between nerve cells. Part #4: Create a question focusing on the relationship or information about the answer. Usage: \\"What cells in the brain are outnumbered by glial cells and rely on them for proper function?\\" This question meets the criteria because it asks about neurons, their relationship to glial cells, and the support they receive from them for proper function."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Estos polímeros son especialmente importantes en la medicina y la investigación científica debido a sus propiedades únicas, como su estabilidad química, su resistencia a la degradación y su capacidad para interactuar con otras sustancias o células. En este caso particular, el polímero sintético posee la capacidad de aglutinar, es decir, de unir o agrupar, a los glóbulos rojos, también conocidos como eritrocitos. Esta propiedad hace que el polímero sea de gran importancia en aplicaciones médicas y en la investigación de trastornos sanguíneos. La heparina es un anticoagulante natural que evita la formación de coágulos en la sangre. Sin embargo, hay momentos en los que es necesario bloquear o reducir el efecto de la heparina, y para ello se utilizan los antagonistas de la heparina. Estos antagonistas son sustancias que se unen a la heparina y, en consecuencia, limitan su función anticoagulante. Por lo tanto, un polímero sintético que aglutina los glóbulos rojos y que se usa como antagonista de la heparina es un compuesto químico fabricado artificialmente, con propiedades específicas para interactuar con las células sanguíneas, en especial los eritrocitos, y limitar la acción de la heparina de manera efectiva y controlada.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Three NY Supreme Court judges could serve past 70 if voters approve amendment Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman is one of three state Supreme Court judges who intend to serve past 70 if a constitutional amendment to raise the retirement age for some judges to 80 passes Tuesday. ALBANY — State Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman is one of three judges on the state’s top court who say they intend to serve past 70 if a constitutional amendment to raise the retirement age for some judges to 80 passes Tuesday. Lippman originally pushed to hike the retirement age for all judges to 80, saying he would be willing to exempt himself and his six colleagues on the Court of Appeals. But ultimately, the Legislature agreed to put a more limited amendment before voters that would only affect state Supreme Court judges. It also allows Court of Appeals judges to complete their 14-year terms even if they pass the current retirement age of 70. Lippman, who would get to serve an additional seven years, and two other Court of Appeals judges, Robert Smith and Eugene Pigott — who both hit 70 within the next three years — said through a spokesman that they plan to continue to serve if the measure passes. That has led some critics of the plan to question Lippman’s lobbying to increase the retirement age for judges. “Was this all about them staying on the court?” asked one insider. A Court of Appeals spokesman said Lippman was serious about exempting that court if the Legislature agreed to try to raise the retirement age for all judges. But that didn’t happen and Lippman — who is close to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver — believes he has more to accomplish before retiring, the spokesman said. Lippman has argued that mandatory retirement at 70 is outdated. If the three Court of Appeals judges were forced to retire at 70 and Gov. Cuomo is reelected next year, he would get to replace all of them, giving him all seven appointments on the court. Cuomo hasn’t taken a position on the amendment but has raised reservations and questioned whether the state wants judges in their late 70s. Currently, state Supreme Court judges must retire at 70, though they can seek a special re-certification every two years that allows them to serve until 76. The measure to up the retirement age to 80 has the support of the court system and many in the legal community. Critics argue the measure excludes judges who work in criminal, county and family courts, which have the largest caseloads and backlogs.","output":"A potential constitutional amendment may raise the retirement age for some judges in New York State from 70 to 80 if it gains approval. Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman, along with two other state Supreme Court judges, has expressed intent to continue serving past the age of 70 if the amendment passes. Originally, Lippman had advocated for raising the retirement age for all judges. However, the proposed amendment applies only to state Supreme Court judges while allowing Court of Appeals judges to complete their 14-year terms even if they surpass the current retirement age. Critics have questioned Lippman's lobbying to increase the retirement age for judges, and some argue this proposed amendment overlooks judges working in criminal, county, and family courts, where caseloads and backlogs are larger. Despite reservations from Governor Cuomo, the measure to increase the retirement age has support from the court system and many within the legal community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He described Wilson as someone who cared deeply for the community he served.

It was important to Wilson, according to Jay, to build trust and rapport with the people, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Write highlights for this article: A Romanian lawyer is suing his local Orthodox bishop and four priests claiming they failed to properly exorcise flatulent demons that were forcing him out of his home. Madalin Ciculescu, 34, accused the five of fraud after they turned up several times to exercise the demons which were responsible for the bad smells that were ruining his business. He claimed that after the failed exorcism the demons even started haunting him at his home at Pitesti in Arges County in central Romania. Romanian lawyer, Madalin Ciculescu, 34, left, is suing his local Orthodox bishop, Constantin Argatu, right, and four priests claiming they failed to properly exorcise flatulent demons that were forcing him out of his home. The case alleging 'religious malpractice' is reportedly the first time there has been such an allegation made in a Romanian court. The four priests had all tried and failed to exorcise the demons, according to the legal papers that named bishop Constantin Argatu, even though he had not been to the property, as he was in charge of the priests who had been there. The case has already been rejected by a lower court in Romania and was rejected again this week by the Romanian High Court, but now the businessmen says he plans to go to the European Court of Human Rights. Unusual case: The court room wall showing the appeal against the earlier ruling. He told the court: 'If they (the accused) represent the way of God then God's ways are crooked. They did not remove the demons that made these bad smells as they promised to do, and I still see all sorts of demons in the form of animals, usually crows but also other such things, that are making my life miserable. 'When I am at home they switch the TV on and off all the time, they make foul smells that give me headaches and basically roam unhindered around my house and my business.' Eerie: The man claimed the demons turned his television on and off and said his hair-dryer was possessed. The man produced his mother to back up his claim saying that even the hair-dryer was possessed and a black shadow came out of it when anyone tried to use it - and she also said the fridge was infested by the flatulent demons that she confirmed left foul smells about the property. But the lawyer for the Archdiocese from Arges, Anton Alin, rejected the allegation of fraud saying that the exorcism had been properly carried out and they believed the allegations of further demons and more bad smells were simply a product of the man's imagination. The Romanian court agreed with the church and rejected the application against Bishop Argatu as well as priests Ionut Cret Ovidiu, Gheorghe Nicut, Marius Dumitrescu and Gheorghe Dunitru - and ordered Ciculescu to pay legal costs. Highlights:","output":"- Romanian lawyer, Madalin Ciculescu, is suing his local Orthodox bishop, Constantin Argatu, and four priests for failing to properly exorcise flatulent demons from his home and business. - Ciculescu claims that the bad smells caused by the demons were ruining his business and that they even began haunting him at his home in central Romania. - This unique case alleges 'religious malpractice' and is the first of its kind in a Romanian court. - All four priests failed to exorcise the demons, and legal papers also named Bishop Argatu, who had not visited the property but was responsible for the priests who attempted the exorcisms. - The case has been rejected twice by Romanian courts, and Ciculescu now plans to take it to the European Court of Human Rights. - The Archdiocese has rejected the fraud allegation, stating that the exorcism was carried out correctly and the ongoing issues are a product of Ciculescu's imagination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The term \\"salt\\" has multiple meanings, which can be categorized as a noun, a verb, and a symbol in different contexts. Let us consider each meaning separately. As a noun, salt refers to a compound formed from the reaction of an acid with a base. The most common form of salt is sodium chloride (NaCl), or table salt. It is essential for human consumption, as it plays a key role in maintaining fluid balance, nerve transmission, and muscle functioning. Moreover, salt is commonly used for food preservation, seasoning, and preparation. As a verb, the term \\"salt\\" refers to the act of applying salt to an object or surface (usually food) to enhance flavor, preserve perishability, or improve texture. In more abstract usages, it can also mean \\"to add something to\\" or \\"to imbue with.\\" Lastly, in a symbolic sense, salt stands for wisdom, preservation, and the deep spiritual connection to the natural world. Salt has long been valued for its properties, and it is often viewed as sacred or mystical in various religions and cultural practices. Now, let us consider the phrase \\"to take something with a grain of salt.\\" The expression means to approach a piece of information or advice with skepticism or caution when considering its accuracy or value. In other words, it is advised not to wholly believe or accept said information without further examination or confirming its credibility. The origin of \\"to take something with a grain of salt\\" dates back to classical Rome. The phrase originated from the Latin term \\"cum grano salis\\" which literally means \\"with a grain of salt.\\" It is believed that Roman author Pliny the Elder sourced this phrase from an ancient antidote recipe that involved adding a grain of salt in a poison antidote. The idea was that adding the salt would make the potential poison less effective, hence validating the skeptical approach. To address your final question, the two questions you asked do not have the same meaning. The first question seeks to understand the term \\"salt,\\" which has several meanings and uses in various situations. On the other hand, the second question delves into the specific expression, \\"to take something with a grain of salt,\\" focusing on its meaning and historical background. While both questions relate to salt, their implications and purposes are distinct and separate from one another."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases.  As a part of his engineering job Keith is measuring the vapor pressure of two locomotives, engine A and engine B.  Engine A has a high vapor pressure, but engine B has a low vapor pressure. He noticed that to increase the speed of the engines he needed to increase the vapor pressure.  Would engine A have higher or lower temperature than engine B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Engine A would likely have a higher temperature than Engine B. Since Engine A has a high vapor pressure, and vapor pressure is proportional to temperature, an increase in temperature typically results in an increased vapor pressure. Therefore, the higher vapor pressure of Engine A suggests that it is operating at a higher temperature compared to Engine B, which has a lower vapor pressure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? rag","output":"The given goal \\"rag\\" seems unclear. However, considering the factors associated with the term \\"rag,\\" I assume you might be either inquiring about how to make a rag or how to utilize a rag for a specific purpose, such as for cleaning or creating rag-based items like rugs or curtains.  I'll provide ways to accomplish both goals. Please consider providing more context and clarity if these are not your intended goals. **To make a rag from old materials:** 1. Gather materials: Look for old, worn-out clothing, towels, or linens. This could include items like T-shirts, sheets, pillowcases, and dishcloths. Ensure that the fabrics are of similar thickness or texture. 2. Inspect the materials: Check for any stains or damage that may affect the rag's effectiveness. If needed, remove any buttons, trims or zippers. Remember, you're looking for sections of the fabric that are still usable. 3. Prepare your workspace: Ensure you have a clean and uncluttered area to work on. You'll need a flat surface, scissors or a fabric cutter, a ruler, a cutting mat (optional), and a marker or fabric chalk. 4. Measure and mark: Determine the size you want for your rag, taking into account the intended purpose. For general cleaning and dusting purposes, rags can be anywhere from 6\\" x 6\\" to 12\\" x 12\\". Once you've settled on the size, mark the dimensions on your fabric with the marker or fabric chalk using a ruler. 5. Cut the fabric: Cut your material along the marked lines using scissors or a fabric cutter. Make sure to cut as straight or cleanly as possible to avoid frays. 6. Finish the edges (optional): If you're concerned about fraying, you can choose to either hem the edges with a sewing machine or seal the edges with a fabric glue or fray check. 7. Store your new rags: Make sure to keep your rags in an accessible location, such as in a dedicated box, drawer, or container. **To utilize a rag for a specific purpose:** 1. Determine the purpose: Assess what you need the rag for, such as cleaning, dusting, polishing, or crafting a rag-based item like a rag rug or rag curtain. 2. Choose the right rag: Different materials work best for different purposes. Cloth rags made of cotton, linen, or microfiber tend to be effective for cleaning and wiping tasks. Thicker fabrics like terry cloth or flannel may be better for polishing or scrubbing. 3. Prepare the rag for use: Dampen the rag with water or appropriate cleaning solution if needed. For example, if you're using the rag to clean windows, you may use a combination of water and vinegar. If cleaning electronics, you might use water and rubbing alcohol in a 1:1 ratio. Remember to wring out the rag to prevent it from being too wet. 4. Use the rag effectively: When cleaning or dusting, use long, sweeping motions to effectively pick up debris. For polishing, use circular motions to maximize the rag's efficiency in buffing and shining the surface. 5. Maintain your rag: After using it, rinse the rag thoroughly and allow it to air dry before storing. If the rag becomes dirty enough to necessitate laundering, wash it separately or with similar items in cold or lukewarm water, and avoid using fabric softeners as they can reduce the rag's effectiveness. I hope this guidance helps you accomplish your goal of making and using rags. Please don't hesitate to ask for clarification or additional assistance if needed!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who did not take up singing seriously until 1937? , can you please find it?   Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United... Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who did not take up singing seriously until 1937 is Ferrier.

Answer the following question: where was the first documented case of polio?","output":"The first documented case of polio, also known as poliomyelitis or infantile paralysis, dates back to Ancient Egypt. Poliomyelitis is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus, which primarily affects children and can result in paralysis or even death. The earliest evidence of polio's existence can be traced back to around 1400-1500 BCE, during the Eighteenth Dynasty in Ancient Egypt. In 1930, an archeologist discovered a stele (a stone or wooden slab with inscriptions or reliefs) that featured a carving representing a priest with a characteristically withered and deformed lower limb, indicating paralysis from poliomyelitis. This specific physical sign, known as leg deformity, hints at the prevalence of polio in ancient Egyptian society. The first scientific descriptions of poliomyelitis can be attributed to two European physicians, Dr. Jacob von Heine and Dr. Michael Underwood, in the 18th and 19th centuries. Dr. Underwood, an English physician, wrote about a debility of the lower extremities in children in his book published in 1789. Later on, in 1840, Dr. von Heine, a German physician, provided a comprehensive clinical description of poliomyelitis. He classified the disease into three categories based on severity and locality, and his account is noted as the first systematic documentation of polio. Throughout history, various polio outbreaks occurred, with the most severe ones taking place in the 20th century. The first significant polio epidemic of the 20th century occurred in 1916 in the United States, specifically in New York City. This outbreak resulted in over 9,000 cases of paralysis and more than 2,000 deaths. Due to the increasing frequency and severity of these polio epidemics, extensive research was conducted on poliomyelitis, which ultimately led to the development of effective vaccines by Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. To summarize, the first documented evidence of polio can be traced back to Ancient Egypt, around 1400-1500 BCE. However, the clinical descriptions and classifications of polio were developed much later by European physicians in the 18th and 19th centuries. The devastating polio epidemics in the 20th century led to concentrated efforts to understand and eradicate the disease, resulting in the creation of life-saving vaccines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One way we can find out is through newspapers, and \\"The New York Times\\" is a very famous and important one. Do you remember how we sometimes listen to mommy or daddy read stories from a big book? Well, The New York Times is like a big book that has lots and lots of stories about the world and people who live in it! Every day, The New York Times has new stories to tell. People called \\"reporters\\" and \\"journalists\\" go all around the world to find out interesting things, and then they write it down. They talk to people, take pictures, and watch what is happening. Then they put everything together in a story. This is called \\"news.\\" The New York Times has many different parts. There are stories about the people we choose to lead our cities, our country, and the laws they make. This is called \\"politics.\\" There are stories about the earth and how we can take care of it. This is called \\"environment.\\"  It also has stories about people who do amazing things, like climb big mountains, swim across big oceans, and invent cool things, like a new toy or a robot. These stories are called \\"human interest\\" stories because they are about people, just like you and me, doing interesting things. You know how sometimes we go watch a movie or read a book and we talk about what we liked or did not like? The New York Times has a section like that too. It's called \\"reviews.\\" People who work at the newspaper write about movies, books, and even video games to help us decide if we might want to watch, read, or play them.  Sometimes we play with puzzles or games when we are waiting for dinner to be ready or when we have to stay indoors on a rainy day. Well, The New York Times has puzzles too! One of the most famous puzzles is called a \\"crossword puzzle,\\" where we have to find the right word that fits in the blank spaces by solving clues. It's like a fun word riddle! So you see, \\"The New York Times\\" is a really big newspaper that tells us lots of stories every day about our world. It helps us understand what is happening all around us, and it can be fun too!

Available options: A). negative B). positive What would be an example of an A). review?","output":"An example of a negative review (Option A) could be for a fictional restaurant called \\"La Divine Eatery\\". Here's a detailed and long negative review: Title: Disappointing Experience at La Divine Eatery I had high expectations for La Divine Eatery, after hearing positive reviews from friends and seeing their top ratings online. However, my experience was far from satisfactory, and I feel compelled to share my thoughts on this establishment. First and foremost, the ambiance left much to be desired. Upon entering, I noticed that the lighting was rather dim, giving the space an uncomfortable and unwelcoming atmosphere. The decor appeared outdated and mismatched, making the restaurant feel unkempt and uninviting. There were also several tables that were left uncleared for an extended period, with dirty dishes piling up. Moving on to the service, it was painfully slow and unprofessional. It took a long time for our server to greet us, and even longer to take our orders. When we needed assistance or requested refills, it was difficult to catch their attention. Additionally, our server seemed inexperienced and lacked knowledge about the menu items, which led to inaccurate recommendations. The food, which should have been the redeeming factor, was disappointing. We decided to try some of their most popular dishes, hoping that they would be the saving grace of our experience. Unfortunately, the majority of the dishes we ordered were either bland or overly seasoned. The Chicken Alfredo was drowning in a heavy, overly salty sauce, and the pasta was undercooked. The Grilled Vegetable Salad was a haphazard mix of limp vegetables smothered in a harsh, acidic dressing. Furthermore, the food presentation was lackluster and unappetizing. Even the dessert, which should have been a sweet ending to our meal, fell flat. We ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake, which was served barely warm, with the center not oozing with decadent chocolate as it should. The accompanying vanilla ice cream was rapidly melting by the time it reached our table, making the dish even more unappealing. When the time came to settle the bill, I was further irritated to find that they had charged us for an extra dish we had never ordered. It took considerable time to resolve the issue, dragging out an already long and disappointing evening. In conclusion, my visit to La Divine Eatery was a major letdown. The negative aspects – ambiance, service, and most importantly, the food – far outweighed any positive aspects I may have encountered. As a result, I cannot recommend this restaurant to others, and I will not be returning in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Evaluate option I - Paint the insides black - Black color is known to absorb light, reducing its reflection. By painting the insides of the camera black, it will help absorb any unwanted light and prevent it from bouncing around inside the camera. Step 3: Evaluate option II - Paint the insides white - White color is known to reflect light, increasing its reflection. If the insides of the camera are painted white, there is a higher chance that unwanted light will bounce around inside the camera, potentially exacerbating the light leak issue. Step 4: Compare both options - Based on the previous steps, painting the insides black appears to be the better solution to prevent light leaks in a homemade camera. This is because black paint will absorb and reduce unwanted light, while white paint would reflect and potentially increase unwanted light.

On a fateful night, while scanning the skies using a powerful telescope, they notice an enormous comet on a collision course with Earth. According to their calculations, the comet, named Apollyon, is massive enough to cause unparalleled destruction upon impact, leading to the extinction of all life on the planet. Desperate to warn the world of the impending doom, Dr. Hendron and Dr. Frye contact the United Nations to present their findings. Initially, the authorities are skeptical, but after a satellite confirms their predictions, world leaders are forced to take the situation seriously. As panic and chaos spread worldwide, a global coalition is formed under the supervision of the UN, with Dr. Hendron and Dr. Frye serving as the head scientists to guide humanity through this catastrophe. With only six months to find a solution, Dr. Hendron and Dr. Frye embark on a race against time with a diverse team of the world's brightest minds, including engineers, physicists, and mathematicians. They work tirelessly to develop methods and strategies to prevent the collision or minimize its catastrophic consequences. Several plans are put forward, such as altering the comet's trajectory, destroying it through nuclear weapons, and even building underground shelters to save a portion of the population. As the weeks turn into months, it becomes clear that none of these solutions can guarantee the safety of humanity. As tensions rise and nations wrestle with the inevitability of the impending apocalypse, Dr. Hendron and Dr. Frye develop a last-ditch plan: to build a colossal spacecraft, named 'Ark-One,' capable of carrying a sample of Earth's population and biodiversity to establish a colony on a distant, habitable planet. With a renewed sense of urgency, countries set aside their differences and come together to build Ark-One. Simultaneously, Dr. Hendron and Dr. Frye launch a desperate mission to find a suitable planet to serve as humanity's new home. In the thrilling climax, with minutes to spare before Apollyon's devastating impact, Ark-One successfully launches into space, carrying Earth's survivors to their uncertain future on a distant world. Dr. Hendron and Dr. Frye watch the launch from the control room, knowing they have given humanity a fighting chance. As the comet crashes into Earth, they place their hope in the brave souls aboard Ark-One to serve as the seeds for a new chapter in human history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Precipitation is water that falls from the sky. This may fall as liquid water, mostly as rain . It may fall also as frozen water, such as snow.   Q: What is the water that falls from the sky called?   Choices:  - evaporation  - condensation  - moisture  - precipitation  A: Answer:","output":"Precipitation Based on the given paragraph, the water that falls from the sky is called precipitation. The paragraph explains that clouds are necessary for precipitation to occur, which is the process of water falling from the sky. This can happen in various forms, such as liquid water (primarily rain) or frozen water (such as snow).  To further your understanding, below are explanations for the other choices mentioned: - Evaporation: This is the process where liquid water turns into water vapor and rises into the atmosphere. This is not the correct answer since it describes the process leading up to precipitation, specifically how clouds are formed when water from the Earth's surface evaporates and enters the atmosphere. - Condensation: This is the process in which water vapor cools and changes from a gas to liquid droplets, which then form clouds. This process is closely related to precipitation, as it plays a role in cloud formation. However, it is not the correct answer since it describes the formation of clouds before precipitation occurs. - Moisture: This term refers to the presence of water in the air, encompassing all states of water (vapor, liquid, and ice). Moisture can be a factor leading to precipitation, but it is not the term for water falling from the sky itself.  In conclusion, precipitation is the correct answer as it specifically refers to water falling from the sky, which may occur in different forms such as liquid water (rain) or frozen water (snow). The other options – evaporation, condensation, and moisture – all play important roles in the water cycle but are not the specific terms for water falling from the sky like precipitation is."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A). negative. B). positive. Answer:","output":"B). Positive The sentiment of the sentence \\"just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer\\" is perceived as positive. This statement implies assurance and expectation of an enjoyable experience watching the movies during the summer, which is a positive sentiment. Any assurance of a good time indicates a positive emotion or feeling towards the subject matter, in this case, the movies. Therefore, the sentiment is positive because it communicates a favorable opinion and satisfaction.  This statement means the speaker strongly believes that going to the movies this summer would be the most reliable way to have a fun and enjoyable time. The phrasing of \\"surest bet\\" implies a high level of confidence and certainty that the local cinema will provide a remarkable experience. \\"An all-around good time\\" emphasizes this perspective, suggesting that from all aspects, the movies will offer a comprehensive form of entertainment. Again, this is a positive sentiment, since the speaker is enthusiastic and anticipates a pleasurable experience.  The time element, \\"this summer\\", adds anticipation and contributes to the overall positive sentiment as well, since summer is often associated with relaxation, leisure activities, and overall enjoyment. The expectations for the cinematic experience are heightened due to this added component of seasonal delight.  Lastly, it's worth noting the general context in which a statement like this might be made. If a person is enthusiastic about recommending the movies as a sure bet for a good time, there's a likelihood they're speaking from previous positive experiences or valuable word-of-mouth, which also indicates a positive sentiment.  Therefore, analyzing the sentiment of a statement encompasses looking at the choice of words, the context, and the conveyed feelings. In all these aspects, this sentence radiates positivity."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can.

After serving in the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession, he was appointed by King George I as governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire in 1716.  His tenure was marked by virulent disagreements with the Massachusetts assembly on a variety of issues, and by poorly conducted diplomacy with respect to the Native American Wabanaki Confederacy of northern New England that led to Dummer's War . Although Shute was partly responsible for the breakdown in negotiations with the Wabanakis, he returned to England in early 1723 to procure resolutions to his ongoing disagreements with the Massachusetts assembly, leaving conduct of the war to Lieutenant Governor William Dummer.  His protests resulted in the issuance in 1725 of the Explanatory Charter, essentially confirming his position in the disputes with the assembly.  He did not return to New England, being replaced as governor in 1728 by William Burnet, and refused to be considered for reappointment after Burnet's sudden death in 1729. Thomas Hutchinson , in his history of Massachusetts, described Shute's tenure as governor as the most contentious since the Antinomian Controversy of the 1630s. Answer this question: How many years after being appointed as governor of Massachusetts did Samuel Shute return to England?","output":"Samuel Shute was appointed as governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire in 1716 and returned to England in early 1723.

Title: The Fly II Movie plot: Several months after the death of Seth Brundle, his lover Veronica is giving birth to their son at Bartok Industries, the company that funded Brundle's experiments. The labor is very painful, and her accomplice Stathis Borans is dragged away from the procedure after he objects to her treatment. She eventually gives birth to a larval sac, causing her to go into shock and die. The larval sac is opened by the surgeons to reveal a seemingly normal human baby inside.The baby is named \\"Martin\\" by the scientists. He begins to age much faster than a normal human; the company's CEO, Bartok, tells him that this is due to an extremely rare disease called \\"Brundle's Accelerated Growth Syndrome\\", caused by inherited mutant DNA from his father (hence the disease's name). Martin is just as much of a genius as his father, and Bartok wants him to finish the work Seth started. One day, Martin sneaks into a room where animals are held for testing, and befriends a Golden Retriever. He slips out of his room one day to bring the dog some of his dinner, but he finds that it has been transferred to another section. Martin goes there to discover a new set of Telepods, like the ones his father invented; his dog is being prepared for teleportation. The scientists send the dog through, but it unfortunately emerges as a hideous mutant, biting off a scientist's fingers. A horrified Martin screams, as Bartok consoles him.Five years after Martin's birth, he is now physically 20 years old. He is taken to a new living space, which is much more luxurious and wide open. Bartok also tells Martin that he wants him to fix the Telepods; as Martin saw with the dog, they are unable to properly teleport anything, even inanimate objects like apples. Bartok assures Martin that the dog didn't suffer long, and apologizes for it. Martin is still skeptical about working on the Telepods, but Bartok gives him videotapes of his father being interviewed by Veronica to watch.

The answer to the question: What shows a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art? is inside the article: The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period, mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi. They show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs.  Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes. The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously St Peter's, Rome) over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church. The beliefs of many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture). In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or \\"Art of Dying\\".  It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy.  As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones., can you guess it ?","output":"Yes, based on the provided information, the answer to the question \\"What shows a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art?\\" is found in the statement, \\"The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period, mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi.\\" These catacombs show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It lasted from about 174 to 163 million years ago. In European lithostratigraphy, rocks of this Middle Jurassic age are called the Dogger. This name in the past was also used to indicate the Middle Jurassic epoch itself, but is discouraged by the IUGS, to distinguish between rock units and units of geological time.  - The Early Cretaceous/Middle Cretaceous (geochronological name) or the Lower Cretaceous (chronostratigraphic name), is the earlier or lower of the two major divisions of the Cretaceous. It is usually considered to stretch from 146 Ma to 100 Ma.  - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - Iguanodon (; meaning \\"iguana-tooth\\") is a genus of ornithopod dinosaur that existed roughly halfway between the first of the swift bipedal hypsilophodontids of the mid-Jurassic and the duck-billed dinosaurs of the late Cretaceous. While many species have been classified in the genus \\"Iguanodon\\", dating from the late Jurassic Period to the late Cretaceous Period of Asia, Europe, and North America, research in the first decade of the 21st century suggests that there is only one well-substantiated species: \\"I. bernissartensis\\", which lived from the late Barremian to the earliest Aptian ages (Early Cretaceous) in Belgium and possibly elsewhere in Europe, between about 126 and 125 million years ago. \\"Iguanodon\\" were large, bulky herbivores. Distinctive features include large thumb spikes, which were possibly used for defense against predators, combined with long prehensile fifth fingers able to forage for food.  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - Not to be confused with Dyrosauridae Dryosaurids were primitive iguanodonts . They are known from Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous rocks of Africa , Europe , and North America .  - Hypsilophodonts (named after \\"Hypsilophodon\\", itself derived from the \\"Hypsilophus\\" (\\"high-crested\\") genus of iguana lizard and literally meaning \\"\\"Hypsilophus\\"-tooth\\") were small ornithopod dinosaurs, regarded as fast, herbivorous bipeds on the order of 12 meters long (3.36.6 feet). They are known from Asia, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, North America, and South America, from rocks of Middle Jurassic to late Cretaceous age. The group traditionally has included almost all bipedal bird-hipped dinosaurs other than iguanodonts, and some early phylogenetic analyses found it to be a natural group, but more recent studies have found that the group is mostly paraphyletic and the taxa within represent a series leading up to Iguanodontia. Some of these studies have moved some traditional hypsilophodonts out of the Ornithopoda, such as \\"Agilisaurus\\" and \\"Othnielosaurus\\" (=\\"Othnielia\\"). Thus, the only certain member at this time is \\"Hypsilophodon\\".    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'.

They are distinctly different in terms of the context, particular information being sought after, and the responses they will generate.  Let's break down each question. Firstly, \\"What is teabagging?\\" Teabagging is a term derived from the online gaming community, particularly from first-person shooter games. It is a rather comic (though questionable) action performed by a player's avatar, where the character crouches repeatedly over a defeated opponent's character to taunt or celebrate. The term mirrors a real-world action of dipping a tea bag into a cup of hot water, hence, 'teabagging.' It is seen by some gamers as a harmless, playful tactic, while others may find it disrespectful or unsporting. The second question, \\"What is the best gamer lifehack?\\" asks for a very different kind of information. Instead of seeking the definition or meaning of a particular term or behavior, it's asking for tips, tricks, or strategies to efficiently succeed in gaming or improve the overall gaming experience. A lifehack in a gaming context might involve suggestions for optimal equipment setups, software enhancements, time or task management for lengthy games, or techniques for mastering certain aspects of gameplay. In conclusion, although both questions pertain to the world of gaming, their focus is different. The first question seeks to define a specific term used in the gaming community, while the second question prompts for advice or tips to enhance a gamer's experience. Thus, they are not only answered differently but also provide different types of information.

Let's see the definition of this term:phubbing n. the act of snubbing someone in a social setting by looking at your cell phone instead of paying attention As you can probably guess, phubbing is a blend of phone and snubbing. The term was coined by a 23-year-old Melbourne resident Alex Haigh. Obviously, he got fed up with how people are always checking Facebook or Twitter on their phones when they are supposed to be interacting with someone face to face. He wanted to put an end to this social phenomenon, therefore he came up with this catchy term. And it did catch on. The word's earliest media mention dates back to June 2012, and in a little over a year's time, phubbing has already been picked up by almost all the mainstream media outlets one can think of. Here is a typical example from the British newspaper The Independent. In the article titled The Rise of Phubbing, which was published on August 5, 2013, Tom Chatfield writes, there's an uncomfortable truth at the heart of phubbing: other people are easier to handle when seen on screen. They're less likely to demand unreasonable efforts such as undivided attention or clean shirts. While the term phubbing has undoubtedly taken off, some people question why it is called phubbing instead of phnubbing. Alex Haigh has not personally addressed the issue, but word has it that phubbing sounds more crispy and thus easier to remember. Phubbing is indeed a univers al problem that can no longer be ignored. So why do people keep phubbing each other if they know it's rude? Is there anything we can do to stop it? Or maybe we should just be more kind, because sometimes there are good excuses to phub. I think there is plenty we can do to try and stop phubbing. For starters, we can jo in Alex Haigh in his Stop Phubbing campaign. Remind our friends and family that phubbing is not appreciated. We can also make or download some anti-phubbing posters to spread the word in public places. And don't forget that some phubbers simply do not realize the harmful effect their behavior has on others,so be b rave enough to stop them, even if you are a total stranger.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Major Charles 'Copper' Carrington (David Niven), who has a distinguished World War II record and was awarded the Victoria Cross, is arrested for embezzling Â£125 from his unit's safe. Other charges include leaving the base and entertaining a woman officer in his room, this being forbidden by the base commander Colonel Henniker (Allan Cuthbertson). Appearing in his own defence, Carrington's case at his court-martial is that he took the money openly because of back pay owed him. The Army Paymaster had failed to pay him for expenses during postings in the Far East and his wife Valerie (Margaret Leighton) was pressuring him for money. She lives in another part of the country, and has become ill and suicidal as a result of financial worries. Carrington claims he told his superior, Colonel Henniker, about his decision to remove the money. He transferred Â£100 of it to his wife's account to give her relief from her financial problems. He then left the base to compete in a major horse race in which he betted the rest of the money on himself, hoping to be able to pay back the cash taken. When he fell from his horse, his friend Captain Alison Graham (Noelle Middleton) tried to return the money, but was denied access to the safe. As for the incident in his room, it is established that Carrington was bed-ridden from his fall and that Graham was visiting him to discuss the embezzlement. She was fully dressed and sitting on a chair when Colonel Henniker stormed in, reminding them that it was against regulations for male and female officers to be together in private quarters. Henniker admits waiting for some time between seeing Graham go to Carrington's room and then entering himself. Henniker is in fact Carrington's enemy, resenting his war record, achievements and popularity at the base. There is an element of... My question: who will be quashed and Carrington acquitted Answer:","output":"Based on the provided plot, Major Charles \\"Copper\\" Carrington is accused of embezzlement and other charges. Over the course of the court-martial, the case unravels to reveal that Carrington took the money openly due to back pay owed to him, had informed his superior Colonel Henniker about his decision, and that the incident involving a woman officer in his room was innocent. It is also revealed that Colonel Henniker resents Carrington and is his enemy. While the plot does not specifically mention the final outcome, it is highly suggested that the charges against Carrington would be quashed, and he would be acquitted, because of the evidence and explanations presented at the trial that justify his actions and show Henniker's bias against him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: (I) negative (II) positive","output":"I would identify this review as negative (I). While the reviewer acknowledges the great production values and performers, their main focus is on the negative aspects that impacted their overall experience.  Firstly, the reviewer criticizes the show's length, stating that the one-hour runtime is \\"ridiculous for the price.\\" This indicates that they didn't find the show to be a good value for the money spent, which could discourage potential viewers or attendees from watching or attending the show. Moreover, the reviewer's use of the word \\"ridiculous\\" highlights that they feel strongly about this negative aspect of the show. Secondly, the reviewer comments on how the show's music selection lacks appeal to a more modern and younger demographic. As they mention being 65 years old and still finding that the music is too outdated, the reviewer suggests that one would need to be significantly older to appreciate the musical choices. This criticism may be considered a negative aspect, as it reflects that the show is not catering to a broader audience or staying in tune with contemporary preferences. In conclusion, despite mentioning positive elements like the production values and performers, the overall tone of the review leans more towards the negative side, as the reviewer's primary focus is on the issues that impacted their enjoyment of the show. The issues raised, such as the show duration and music selection, convey dissatisfaction with the experience, leading me to categorize this review as negative (I)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 1: Understanding the Task Firstly, I need to understand the context of the question and the options given. The question is about cowboys, people who tend cows and other livestock on a ranch and perform other farm tasks, and where they were leading the heifers, which are young female cows. Step 2: Evaluating the Options Now let's go through each option to evaluate their plausibility: - deep sea: Cowboys and heifers would not be in the deep sea as it is not the natural environment for either. - slaughterhouse: While technically a place where cows may end up, the wording of the question, specifically \\"across the property,\\" suggests a location within the same property or farm, not a separate destination which usually slaughterhouse implies. - cattle ranch: A realistic answer considering cowboys works on ranches and heifers are cattle which would be tended on a ranch. - countryside: While countryside is a viable setting for a cattle ranch, the question specifically asks about where the heifers were being herded towards, not the general area where this was taking place. - barnyard: This could be a potential destination, but it's less likely since ranch is specifically implemented in the cowboy's tasks to herd cattle. Step 3: Making the Final Decision Based on the analysis of the question and the options, the most logical answer is \\"cattle ranch\\". While few options could be somehow linked to the activity of cowboys and heifers, \\"cattle ranch\\" is the most direct and plausible answer in the context given."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The forward voltage drop (e.g. about 1.7 V for a normal red LED) can be used instead of a Zener diode in low-voltage regulators. Red LEDs have the flattest I/V curve above the knee. Nitride-based LEDs have a fairly steep I/V curve and are useless for this purpose. Although LED forward voltage is far more current-dependent than a Zener diode, Zener diodes with breakdown voltages below 3 V are not widely available.\\"  Answer:","output":"The type of diode that allows current to flow with light is a photodiode. In the given context, LEDs are discussed as a medium-quality voltage reference in electronic circuits. While LEDs emit light when a current is applied, a photodiode works in the opposite way, generating a current when it is exposed to light.

The answer is:","output":"Joachim Vadian, also known as Joachim Vadianus, was born Joachim von Watt on November 29, 1484, in St. Gallen, Old Swiss Confederacy. Vadian emerged as a leading Swiss humanist scholar of the sixteenth century, known for his contributions as a scholar, historian, and editor. Vadian began his studies at the Universities of Vienna and Basel, where he immersed himself in the intellectual spheres of theology, humanism, and the sciences. His education laid the foundation for a diverse and expansive career, exploring various fields of interest and dedicating himself to public service. During his time in Vienna, Vadian became acquainted with several prominent humanists of the time, including Johannes Cuspinian, Conrad Celtis, and Jakob Wimpfeling. Their influence and intensive collaboration helped to shape Vadian's personal and intellectual growth. In 1512, he married Martha Grebel, the daughter of an esteemed apothecary in St. Gallen, further cementing his ties to the city. Upon returning to St. Gallen, Vadian's knowledge and expertise were recognized, and he was appointed as a lecturer in corresponding scientific fields such as mathematics, physics, and astronomy. Simultaneously, his political career took off as he held various public offices, including those of city physician, councillor, and mayor. He served as mayor of St. Gallen for multiple terms. As a historian, Vadian authored several Latin works, including \\"Epitome trium terrae partium Asiae, Africae et Europae compendiariam locorum descriptionem continens\\" (1534), a historic and geographical survey of the known world at the time. His other works encompassed theological, exegetical, and philological subjects, as well as political history. As an editor, he worked on numerous scientific publications. Aside from his scholarly and political pursuits, Vadian also played a pivotal role in the Protestant Reformation movement in Switzerland. He collaborated with Huldrych Zwingli and other reformers in shaping the religious landscape and took part in various theological discussions and disputes. Joachim Vadian passed away on April 6, 1551, in his birthplace, St. Gallen, Old Swiss Confederacy. His life's work significantly influenced Swiss humanist scholarship and the development of his city. An engraving after an older original by David Herrliberger from Zurich (1748) serves as a tribute to this esteemed scholar, featuring his portrait and commemorating his contributions to humanism, history, and the Reformation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the last name of the person that is interested in the sister of the small-time crook?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Richard Gaddis is a small-time crook with a penchant for con games. To hook marks, he acts like a well-to-do businessman, dressing like one and driving a Mercedes-Benz S500, believing that one must look like a professional in order to be a successful conman. Gaddis is searching for a new partner with whom he can perform more sophisticated cons.  He discovers Rodrigo after he sees the young man playing some minor con games in a casino-bar.  When Rodrigo is caught, Gaddis acts the part of a vice officer to save him from being arrested.  Rodrigo's contribution is a face and naive manner so trustable that he is able to con anyone, while Richard is both completely unprincipled and clever.  After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees. Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts.   Richard accepts, and they plan to sell a fraudulent version of a silver certificate currency note to William Hannigan, a rich collector who is in town. Gyllenhaal plays Gaddis' sister Valerie, a concierge at a hotel.  When Hannigan takes a fancy to the uptight but very sexy Valerie, Gaddis is forced to pull her into the scam, the price of which is Richard's admission to their brother Michael that he has cheated him out of his share of their inheritance. The plot twists constantly as each of the characters becomes more deeply invested in the scam, and the ever-deceitful Richard tries to cheat Rodrigo, Valerie and Michael out of their share of the take. In the twist ending, it is revealed that all the major players involved, including Rodrigo and Hannigan, were playing a confidence game against Gaddis from the very beginning, so that Valerie and Michael could rightfully take their share of their inheritance.

Pirogues cut from the trunks of kapok trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from Mali, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.The collection of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still takes place in Casamance, which is one of three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are an important component of the family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers. contains an answer for the question: What four ways are the oysters cooked by the Jola people?, what is it ?

Shaking the object is definitely not encouraged. But that’s exactly what we—a group of museum curators and conservators—did when this exquisite Greek black-glazed kantharos (wine cup) was temporarily removed from display during the reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Getty Villa. One of just a handful of “rattling cups” that survive from the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., we wanted to learn more about how it was made.(1) Although we were eager to find out what was below the surface of the cup, we started by examining its exterior. The kantharos’s distinctive shape, with profiled lip, tall foot, and elegant, upward-sweeping handles, is characteristic of black-glazed pottery made in the second half of the fourth century B.C., and replicates the form of luxury vessels in metal. Although the cup is currently catalogued as South Italian, the shape—and its striking decoration—are also typical of Athenian manufacture, and it may in fact have been produced there.(2) During the fourth century B.C., Athenian pottery was both imported into southern Italy and imitated by local craftsmen. The best South Italian versions were meant to be difficult to distinguish from Athenian examples, and we are continuing to investigate where ours may have been made. A Greek inscription applied in gilt around the rim reads: ΚΑΣΤΟΡΠΟΛΥΔΕΥΙΚΕΣ (“KASTORPOLYDEUIKES”). Kastor and Polydeukes were twin sons of Zeus—known together as the Dioskouroi—and were worshipped as protectors of sailors, horsemen, and chariot racing.(3) The inscription indicates that the kantharos was dedicated to them, perhaps as thanks for—or in hope of—safe passage at sea or a successful race.

The push notifications keep me informed about any significant changes in the meteorological situation around my location, helping me better plan my day. One of the standout features of the app is the radar and satellite imagery, which allows me to understand not just the current weather patterns but how they're developing. It covers both, regional and national weather patterns, making it equally useful for travelers. However, there is still room for improvement. The app occasionally suffers from slow loading times, especially when accessing more advanced features or during peak usage hours. Additionally, the weather forecast sometimes seems to be a bit off compared to other major weather services. Overall, the com.shahul3d.indiasatelliteweather app deserves a solid 4-star rating.

He says that \\"extreme heat and pressure change rock into metamorphic rock\\" and \\"metamorphic Rocks Metamorphic rocks are the most common rocks in which garnets are found\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Choices: --by radioactive formations --extreme cold and pressure --raw crystal formations --extreme heat and pressure --The bending of a ray of light --rays or beams --Light passing through water --solid, liquid, gas The answer is:","output":"\\"extreme heat and pressure\\" This is the best answer to the question based on the hints provided by the teacher. Garnets formation is typically associated with metamorphic rocks which are primarily formed through extreme heat and pressure. This process tends to cause changes in the physical or chemical composition of the rocks.  To explain further, the process involves pre-existing rocks, also known as parent rocks, which can be either sedimentary, igneous or even older metamorphic rocks. When these rocks are subjected to intense heat and pressure, deeper below the Earth's surface, they undergo a physical or chemical change to form metamorphic rocks. This change may not melt the rock completely, but instead, it affects the texture, crystal structures, mineralogy and can help with the formation of new minerals, such as garnets.  The process often takes millions of years and it can happen in a variety of settings, such as along tectonic plate margins, or in areas where mountains are being formed. The pressure exerted on a rock will become greater with an increase in depth. Similarly, the temperature increases the deeper you go below the surface of the Earth.  Garnets, which are usually deep red or brown in color, are silicate minerals that crystallize in the cubic system. They are typically found in metamorphic rocks like gneiss and schist, where they can grow large and are often well-formed crystals. So, the extreme heat and pressure are essential for their formation and crystal growth, and thus it’s the best option among the choices provided. The other choices, such as \\"by radioactive formations\\", \\"extreme cold and pressure\\", \\"raw crystal formations\\", etc., do not accurately describe the specific conditions under which garnets are usually formed.

It seems like every day there's some new research about whether our favorite drinks are good for us.  One day,  science says a glass of red wine a day will help us live longer. The next day, maybe not.  It seems journalists are pretty interested in wine research and the same might be said for coffee.  Now there's been a lot of research into whether coffee's good for our health \\"the results have really been mixed\\",admits Neal Freedman who led the coffee study and published his findings in a medical journal recently.   \\"There's been some evidence that coffee might increase the risk of certain diseases and there's also  been  maybe  more recent evidence that coffee  may protect against other diseases as well\\". Freedman and his colleagues undertook the biggest study yet to look at the relationship between coffee and health.  They analyzed data collected from  more than  400,000 Americans ages 50 to 70 participating in the study.  \\"We found that the coffee drinkers had a modestly lower risk of death than the non-drinkers, he said.  Here's what he means by \\"modestly\\": those who drank at least two or three cups a day were about 10 percent or 15 percent less likely to die for any reason during the 13 years of the study when the researchers looked at specific causes of death, coffee drinking appeared to cut the  risk  of  dying from  heart  disease, lung  disease injuries,  accidents  and infections. Now, Freedman stressed that the study doesn't prove coffee can make people live longer .A study like this can never prove a cause-and-effect relationship.

And they are all in the Guinness Book of Records(<<>> ). The book is going to celebrate its birthday this August. It began exactly half a century ago. And it's always one of the best selling books in the world. People now can break over 1000 records every week! Why do so many people want to break the records? Do they want their names in the book or meet more people around the world? \\"It gives people a chance to show they're the best in the world.\\" said one of the record keepers Stewart Newport. The book was started by Hugh Beaver from Britain. In 1951, he went shooting birds and talked with his friends about the fastest bird in Europe. Three years later, they were still talking about it. So Beaver believed that people must have different ideas. So, he decided to start a book to record the world's truly greatest people and things in it! The newest book came out last Tuesday. This book has a lot of interesting records. Here are two:  A British dog, Whitney, is the world's smallest dog. It's only 76mm tall.

Korn fills the role of the Scooby-Doo crew, also known as Mystery, Inc., investigating the supernatural occurrences in the town. Korn's members Jonathan Davis, James \\"Munky\\" Shaffer, Reginald \\"Fieldy\\" Arvizu, Brian \\"Head\\" Welch, and David Silveria all provided their own voices for this episode, lending authenticity to the portrayal of the band. It is worth noting that several band members are fans of the show, which explains their involvement in the voice-over project. In the storyline, Korn's members display detective skills and employ the use of their \\"Korn Powers,\\" a humorous homage to the supernatural abilities displayed by characters in Scooby-Doo. While solving the mystery, they get caught up in the necrophilia subplot, which adds South Park's trademark dark humor and satirical tones to the episode. This particular theme and its explicit content are not suitable for all audiences, but it does represent the provocative style for which South Park is best known. In conclusion, it is accurate to say that the band Korn provided their voices for the South Park episode \\"Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery.\\" This unique collaboration between musicians and an animated series resulted in a blending of genres, styles, and fan bases. The crossover episode stands as a memorable part of South Park's long history and further cements Korn's connection with popular culture beyond their music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After working extensively with the catatonic patients who survived the 1917-1928 encephalitis lethargica epidemic, Sayer discovers that certain stimuli reach beyond the patients' respective catatonic states: Activities such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, and experiencing human touch all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. While patient Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) proves elusive in this regard, Sayer soon discovers that Lowe is able to communicate with him using a Ouija board.After attending a lecture on the subject of L-Dopa and its success with Parkinson's sufferers, Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Lowe yields astounding results, as he completely \\"awakens\\" from his catatonic state; inspiring Sayer to seek funding so that all his patients can receive L-Dopa and experience \\"awakenings\\" back to reality.Meanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula (Penelope Ann Miller), the daughter of another patient, and begins spending time with her when she comes to the hospital to visit her father. Leonard also begins to chafe at the restrictions on him as an in-patient, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases, and stirs up a bit of a revolt in the process of arguing his case repeatedly to Sayer and the hospital administration. Sayer notices that as Leonard grows more agitated while battling administrators and staff about his perceived confinement, a number of facial and body tics are starting to manifest that Leonard has difficulty controlling.While Sayer and the hospital staff continue to delight in the success of L-Dopa with this group of patients, they soon find that it is a temporary triumph.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, let's examine each question separately.  Question 1: What if there is an equal amount of antimatter and matter in the universe? This question is about a hypothetical scenario in which the universe contains equal amounts of antimatter and matter. To answer this question, I would analyze the consequences of such a scenario, as well as the current scientific understanding of the matter-antimatter balance in the universe. Answering this question step-by-step: 1. Review current understanding of matter and antimatter distribution in the universe. 2. Evaluate a scenario in which the matter-antimatter balance is equal. 3. Analyze the consequences and implications of this scenario, including possible interactions and annihilation events. Question 2: It's said there are 10^80 atoms in the universe. Does this include antimatter and dark matter or is not enough known about those to quantify them? This question is asking whether the estimate of 10^80 atoms in the universe includes antimatter and dark matter, or if the quantification of these is still uncertain. To answer this question, I would explain the current understanding of the composition of the universe and the basis for the 10^80 atoms estimate. Answering this question step-by-step: 1. Review current understanding of the composition of the universe, including proportions of matter, antimatter, and dark matter. 2. Examine the basis for the 10^80 atoms estimate. 3. Determine whether the 10^80 atoms estimate includes antimatter and dark matter, or if these are not well-quantified within that estimate. Comparing both questions, the first question is a hypothetical scenario focusing on the consequences of an equal balance of matter and antimatter, while the second question investigates whether the estimated number of atoms in the universe includes antimatter and dark matter.

Q: [9635, 4025, 'i', 'c', '6597', 'j', '645', 'C', 'a', 'c', 8077, 9137, 4637], ['L', 'k', 'i', 'c', '6597', 'j', '645', 'C', 'a', 'x', 9437, 'F', 'i', 'M'] A:","output":"To find the longest common subsequence in the given lists A and B, follow these steps: 1. Create a 2D matrix with the dimensions \`(len(A)+1)\` x \`(len(B)+1)\`. Initialize all elements in the matrix to 0. 2. Loop through each element in both lists (use nested loops). Compare each element from list A with each element from list B. 3. If the elements from A and B are equal, add 1 to the value found in the previous diagonal cell (i.e., the cell at \`matrix[i-1][j-1]\`) and store this value in the current cell \`matrix[i][j]\`. 4. If the elements from A and B are not equal, choose the maximum value between the previous elements in the same row or the same column (i.e., \`max(matrix[i-1][j], matrix[i][j-1])\`) and store this value in the current cell \`matrix[i][j]\`. 5. Once you have completed all iterations, the matrix's bottom-right cell will contain the length of the longest common subsequence. 6. To find the actual subsequence, backtrack from the bottom-right cell by considering the following rules:    - If the cell value is equal to its left cell value, move left.    - If the cell value is equal to its top cell value, move up.    - If the cell value is the result of its top-left cell value incremented by 1, it means that this element is part of the longest common subsequence. Include it in the result and move diagonally up and to the left. 7. Reverse the subsequence (as you collected elements in reverse order) and return it. Following the procedure, here is the Python code that computes the longest common subsequence: \`\`\`python def longest_common_subsequence(A, B):     matrix = [[0] * (len(B) + 1) for _ in range(len(A) + 1)]     for i in range(1, len(A) + 1):         for j in range(1, len(B) + 1):             if A[i-1] == B[j-1]:                 matrix[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j-1] + 1             else:                 matrix[i][j] = max(matrix[i-1][j], matrix[i][j-1])     longest_subsequence = []     i, j = len(A), len(B)     while i > 0 and j > 0:         if matrix[i][j] == matrix[i-1][j]:             i -= 1         elif matrix[i][j] == matrix[i][j-1]:             j -= 1         else:             longest_subsequence.append(A[i-1])             i -= 1             j -= 1     return longest_subsequence[::-1] A = [9635, 4025, 'i', 'c', '6597', 'j', '645', 'C', 'a', 'c', 8077, 9137, 4637] B = ['L', 'k', 'i', 'c', '6597', 'j', '645', 'C', 'a', 'x', 9437, 'F', 'i', 'M'] result = longest_common_subsequence(A, B) print(result) \`\`\` This code will output the longest common subsequence: \`\`\` ['i', 'c', '6597', 'j', '645', 'C', 'a'] \`\`\` This is the longest common subsequence in the given lists A and B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: Didn't Last Long-No Customer Service Review: I purchased this item last April and had used it only 8-10 times through the summer. It worked well (when it was operational) on small jobs that I needed done. However, in October I needed to do some maintenance on the pool but when I turned it on, the motor/blades (for lack of a better word) would barely turn, sounding as if the motor was freezing up. I contacted customer service twice (both times I got an answering machine) and have never received a call back. I gave up after reading the small print in the instruction booklet, as it says for returns you must have the original packing box. Of course, it's a catch-22; even if I still had the container, I couldn't get a call back. I was not impressed with the item or the (complete lack of) customer service. Order at your own risk. A:","output":"Based on the customer's review, it can be concluded that the customer was dissatisfied with the product and the overall experience. There are a few reasons to support this conclusion. 1. Product durability: The customer expressed disappointment in the product's performance, as it didn't last long even though it was used only 8-10 times. The motor seemed to be freezing up, which indicates a possible malfunction or low quality of the product. 2. Inadequate customer service: The customer reached out to the customer service twice to discuss the issue with the product but received no response. This shows that the company's customer service failed to address the customer's concerns, which adds to the dissatisfied experience. 3. Frustration with the return policy: The customer also emphasized that the return policy required the original packing box, which they no longer had. However, even if they had retained the container, they were unable to get in touch with the customer service, creating a catch-22 situation. This further adds to the dissatisfaction that the customer faced. 4. Lack of trust in the company: In the review, the customer warns future buyers to \\"order at your own risk.\\" This statement suggests that the customer was so unhappy with the product and customer service that they wouldn't recommend the product to others. In summary, based on the customer's review, it is reasonable to conclude that they were dissatisfied, citing issues with the product's durability, a lack of customer service, and frustration with the return policy. The customer's final remark highlights the lack of trust in the company and the overall negative experience they had with the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They don't act in the romantic ways that I read in books or I see on TV. My father has a bad temper. When he's tired from the hard work, it is easy for him to lose his temper. One day, my mother was sewing a quilt  . \\"Mom, may I ask you a question?\\" I said. \\"What?\\" \\"Is there love between you and Dad?\\" I asked her in a very low voice. My mother stopped her work and raised her head in surprise. She didn't answer immediately. Then she continued to sew the quilt. I was very worried because I thought I had hurt her. But at last I heard my mother say the following words: \\"Susan, look at the thread  . Sometimes it appears, but most of it disappears in the quilt. It makes the quilt strong. If life is a quilt, then love should be a thread. It can hardly be seen, but it's really there. Love is inside.\\" I couldn't understand her until the next spring. My dad got sick suddenly. My mum had to stay with him in the hospital for a month. When they returned, they both looked very pale. _ . After they were back, every day in the morning and dusk, my mother helped my father walk slowly on the country road. The doctor had said my father would recover in two months. But after two months he still couldn't walk by himself. All of us were worried about him. \\"Dad, how are you feeling now?\\" I asked. \\"Susan, don't worry about me,\\" he said gently. \\"I just like walking with your mom. I like this kind of life.\\" Looking at his eyes, I knew he loves my mother deeply. Once I thought love meant flowers, gifts and sweet kisses. But now, I understand that love is just like the thread. Love is inside, making life strong and warm. The writer felt worried because   _  . A) her mum was angry with her B) her mum didn't know how to answer the question C) she thought she hurt her mum's heart D) her mum's answer was hard to understand","output":"The story you shared about your parents portrays a deep understanding of love that is not often depicted in media or popular culture. It is not always the grand gestures, romantic storylines, or perfect relationships that define love, but rather the quiet strength and support that binds two people together through life's ups and downs. Yes, your parents might not show their love in the same way that books or television series do, but that doesn't mean they don't share a deep connection. When you asked your mother about the love between her and your father, her response was profound. By using the metaphor of a thread in a quilt that is not always seen but still contributes to its strength and warmth, she explained that love is not always visible, but it is always present. It was not until your father's illness that you were able to grasp the full meaning of your mother's words. The way she cared for him in the hospital and helped him through his recovery shows the strength of their bond. Your father's confession about enjoying the walks with your mother and the look in his eyes when talking about her are true demonstrations of love. In response to the question about why the writer felt worried, the correct answer would be C) she thought she hurt her mum's heart. Your concern stemmed from the fact that your mother did not immediately respond to your question about love between her and your dad. You may have been worried that you crossed a boundary or brought up a sensitive subject. However, your mother's eventual response was gentle and insightful, teaching you a valuable lesson about love. Real-life love is neither perfect nor straightforward, but it is the quiet moments, acts of care, and unspoken support that truly define the relationship between two people. Your parents may not always display their love overtly, but their shared life experiences and the way they face challenges together are a testament to the love that exists within their relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some ancient people believed that lightning and thunder were the weapons of the gods.  In reality, lightning is a flow of electricity formed high above the earth. A single flash of lightning 1.6 kilometers long has enough electricity to light one million light bulbs . The American scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, was the first to show the connection between electricity and lightning in 1752. In the same year he also built the first lightning rod  . This device protects buildings from being damaged by lightning. Modern science has discovered that one stroke of lightning has a voltage   of more than 15 million volts  . A flash of lightning between a cloud and the earth may be as long as 13 kilometers, and travel at a speed of 30 million meters per second. Scientists judge that there are about 2,000 million flashes of lightning per year. Lightning hits the Empire State Building in New York City 30 to 48 times a year. In the United States alone it kills an average of one person every day. The safest place to be in case of an electrical storm is in a closed car. Outside, one should go to low ground and not get under tress. Also, one should stay out of water and away from metal fences. Inside a house, people should avoid open doorways and windows and not touch wires or metal things. Question: Lightning can travel   _  . Options: A: as quickly as water B: not so quickly as electricity C: at very high speed D: at very low speed A:","output":"C: at very high speed The article states that lightning can travel at a speed of 30 million meters per second, which is considered an incredibly high speed. This fact rules out option D, which suggests a low speed. While options A and B mention comparisons with water and electricity, without specifying the speeds of water and electricity in the context of the question, these choices can't provide an accurate answer. Therefore, it can be concluded that option C, i.e., \\"lightning can travel at very high speed,\\" is the best and most accurate choice among the provided options. Furthermore, the ability of lightning to travel such long distances (up to 13 kilometers as per the article) in such a short span of time further emphasizes its high speed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

BAGNERES DE-LUCHON, France (AP) — Four-time champion Chris Froome is among several riders who have had their eyes treated for tear gas or pepper spray sprayed on the peloton when a farmer’s protest interrupted the 16th stage of the Tour de France. Police had to remove bales of hay blocking the road 30 kilometers into the 218-kilometer leg from Carcassonne to Bagneres De-Luchon. An Associated Press photographer at the scene says Froome and other riders had eye drops applied while stopped for several minutes. It isn’t immediately clear who used the chemicals. Can we draw the following conclusion? Chris Froome is a 4 time champion Select from the following.  -- Yes;  -- It's impossible to say;  -- No;","output":"-- Yes;  The text clearly mentions that Chris Froome is a four-time champion. Right at the start of the passage, it is stated, \\"Four-time champion Chris Froome is among several riders...\\" This phrase directly implies that Chris Froome has won the championship four times in the past. No other context is needed or provided to lead us to a different conclusion. Therefore, we can definitively say that Chris Froome is a four-time champion. His championship titles could be in regards to the Tour de France or another cycling event; however, the particular event is not specified in this passage.

We want to get all the \\"t\\"s on one side of the equation. We can do that by adding 85*t to both sides.     -85*t + 85*t = 264*t + 5235 + 85*t 2. This simplifies to:    0 = 349*t + 5235 3. Now, we want to get \\"t\\" by itself. We can do that by subtracting 5235 from both sides:    0 - 5235 = 349*t 4. This simplifies to:    -5235 = 349*t 5. Finally, to find the value of \\"t\\", we need to divide both sides of the equation by 349:    -5235 / 349 = t 6.

It includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules for monks in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differs slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The Patimokkha, a foundational aspect of the Vinaya, refers to the collection of rules and regulations guiding the monastic conduct within the Theravada Buddhist tradition. As a moral code specifically designed for monks and nuns, the Patimokkha plays a crucial role in shaping the monastic life and maintaining community harmony. The term \\"Patimokkha\\" can be broken down into two components: \\"Pati\\" meaning \\"toward\\" and \\"Mokkha\\" meaning \\"liberation.\\" This conveys that the rules are intended to guide the monastic community towards spiritual liberation. Comprising 227 rules for monks (Bhikkhus) and 311 rules for nuns (Bhikkhunis), the Patimokkha serves as a code of conduct that provides a practical framework for monastic discipline. These rules focus on promoting a lifestyle that fosters mindfulness, simplicity, and meditation, thereby enabling monks and nuns to stay on the path to enlightenment while living harmoniously within the monastic community. The Patimokkha rules can be divided into eight categories, based on the severity of the transgression and the corresponding penalties. The categories are: 1. Parajika: Rules that entail expulsion from the monastic community. There are four Parajika rules for monks and eight for nuns. Violation of these rules leads to immediate expulsion from the monastic order. 2. Sanghadisesa: Rules that call for disciplinary proceedings within the community. There are thirteen Sanghadisesa rules for monks and seventeen for nuns. Offenders must undergo penance and rehabilitation under the supervision of the monastic community. 3. Aniyata: Rules with undetermined penalties that require the offender to undergo a formal inquiry by the community. There are two Aniyata rules for monks and nuns. 4. Nissaggiya Pacittiya: Rules involving offenses that require the relinquishment of any gains made from the offense and confession. There are thirty Nissaggiya Pacittiya rules for monks and thirty-two for nuns. 5. Pacittiya: Rules that necessitate self-confession and acknowledgment of the offense in front of a fellow monastic. There are ninety-two Pacittiya rules for monks and one hundred and sixty-six for nuns. 6. Patidesaniya: Rules requiring an acknowledgment of wrongdoing but not a formal confession. There are four Patidesaniya rules for monks and eight for nuns. 7. Sekhiya: Rules of training that provide guidance on appropriate monastic behavior and etiquette. There are seventy-five Sekhiya rules for both monks and nuns. 8. Adhikarana-samatha: Rules governing the resolution of conflicts within the monastic community. There are seven Adhikarana-samatha rules for both monks and nuns. In addition to the Patimokkha, the Vinaya also includes regulations for novice monks (Samaneras) who adhere to the ten precepts, which serve as basic guidelines for monastic life. These precepts, a more simplified and less stringent code of conduct, aid in laying the foundation for future adoption of the complete Patimokkha rules when the novice monk is ready to advance within the monastic order. While the Patimokkha serves as a significant source of monastic discipline across the Theravada tradition, the precise content of the Vinaya Pitaka varies slightly among the different schools and subschools of Buddhism. This variation may lead to divergent interpretations and approaches to the adherence of the Vinaya. Despite these variations, the Patimokkha remains a vital component of the monastic discipline across the Buddhist tradition. By providing monks and nuns with a structured moral code, the Patimokkha equips them with the necessary guidance and a conducive environment for deepening their spiritual practice and working towards the ultimate goal of attaining enlightenment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generally, the film is a dark and quirky \\"tragicomedy\\". The \\"everyman\\" protagonist, Dr. Frank Sangster, is a dentist with a fairly pleasant but rather innocuous, ordinary and uneventful life. But all of this gets derailed, and Frank's life descends into an increasingly complex mess, from the minute a beautiful and seductive new patient named Susan Ivey comes to him, seeking a root canal and a little pain relief. On Susan's initial office visit, Frank schedules her for a root canal the very next day, and offers her some Ibuprofen to address her pain in the meanwhile. Claiming that she is allergic to the offered medication, Susan requests a prescription for the addictive pain-killer Demerol. Frank provides the prescription, but only for five tablets. However, Susan changes the dosage from five tablets to fifty when she collects the medication from her pharmacist. Susan arrives for her appointment twelve hours late, having mistaken the time. She seduces Frank, talking him into getting drunk and having sex with her. During the night, Susan steals all of Frank's narcotics. The next day, there is a DEA agent at Frank's office demanding to see the dentist's narcotics supply, because an 18-year-old has driven a car off a cliff under the influence of cocaine hydrochloride from a bottle registered to the dentist. Knowing that Susan has stolen his entire drug supply, Frank puts the agent off, saying he dispensed it all to patients. The agent leaves with the promise that if Frank fails to produce the empty containers in two days, the DEA will place him under arrest. That night Frank goes to Susan's hotel room to demand the empty containers, threatening that he'll call the police if she doesn't provide them.

In Paraguay, siblings Rudy and Gloria and their friend Pat prepare for a journey into the rain forest. They plan to prove Gloria's theory that cannibalism is a myth. The trio encounter Mike and his partner Joe. Joe is badly wounded; Mike explains that they were attacked by cannibals. During the night, Gloria goes missing and Rudy finds a native village while looking for her. Due to Joe's injuries, the travelers decide to stay in the nearly deserted village. Mike seduces the naive Pat. In a cocaine-fueled rage, he encourages Pat to kill a native girl. She is unable to do it, so Mike kills the girl himself. In his dying moments, Joe reveals that he and Mike were responsible for the cannibals' aggression. They came to the region to exploit the natives for emeralds and cocaine, taking advantage of their trust in white men. One day, while high on cocaine, Mike brutally tortured and killed their native guide in full view of the tribe. A badly charred body, previously believed to be that of a different guide, is actually this native. Mike kidnapped a native girl to lead them out of the jungle, but the outsiders were followed and attacked. Following the latest murder, the natives hunt the outsiders. Joe dies of his wounds, and his body is found and cannibalized by the natives in full view of Rudy and Gloria, who are hiding from the natives.

This quartet of twentysomething characters are living in a nightmare. Apparently, a viral pandemic--which co-directors & co-scenarists Alex Pastor and David Pastor tell us absolutely nothing about--has devastated America. Naturally, the lack of exposition shaves off at least fifteen minutes that would have slowed down this cynical melodrama about how humans degenerate in a crisis and become their own worst enemies.This lethal virus gives you the shingles and then you bleed and die.

Brian swerves around Frank when he tries to waylay them, but in the process, the oil pan in their Mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot. Reluctantly, they hitch a ride with Frank after they seal Jodie up in the rear of the SUV. She wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood. Frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it. Sadly, somebody has lied to Frank. The hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some Kool-Aid that will put them out of their misery. The cure did not improve their condition. Everybody else in town is dead. Kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone. Frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he lets the heroic quartet appropriate his SUV and take off.Indeed, \\"Carriers\\" qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves. They reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pump-action shotguns. Incredibly, our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot, but Brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse. Eventually, they discover that one of them has become infected. Later, as they are about to run out of gas, Brian blocks the highway like Frank did at the outset. Danny tries to stop a pair of older Christian women driving the car. Danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help. Brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them. Brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger, but he kills her. No,\\"Carriers\\" is not a beer & pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually non-existent. By the end of this 84-minute movie, our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight. Chris Pine makes quite an impression as fun-loving Brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum, while the only other well-known actress, Piper Perabo, is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role. As Bobby, she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price. It is a testament to Pine's performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others. Essentially, Pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a one-eighty from happy-go-lucky guy to heartless guy. The two directors are Spanish brothers, and they never let the momentum flag. Since there is no relief in sight, \\"Carriers\\" sinks into predictability. \\"Irréversible\\" cinematographer Benoît Debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes, Debie makes it look like a dynamic film. Aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word, \\"Carriers\\" suffers because it is so horribly cynical. The scene when the German shepherd attacks Danny conjures up the most suspense, but even it could have been improved. Unfortunately, the Pastor brothers do not scare up either much tension or suspense. By fade-out, you really don't care what happens to anybody. Question: is it a negative review?

How to make light fettuccine alfredo  Cook the fettuccine.  Bring a large sauce pot full of water to a boil over high heat. Once the water boils, remove the lid and add 1 pound (454 g) of dry fettuccine pasta.","output":"Stir occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking together. Allow the fettuccine to cook for about 8-10 minutes or until it reaches an al dente texture (firm but not hard). You can test this by removing a piece of pasta from the pot, letting it cool for a moment, and biting into it to check the consistency. Keep in mind that the fettuccine will continue to cook slightly after being drained, so it's better to err on the side of a slightly firmer texture. Drain the pasta.  Once the fettuccine is cooked to your desired texture, carefully pour the pasta and water into a colander or use a slotted spoon to remove the pasta from the pot. Allow the pasta to drain for a few moments, then give it a gentle shake to get rid of any excess water. While it's draining, you can start to prepare the light alfredo sauce. Prepare the ingredients for the sauce.  To create a lighter alfredo sauce, you will need the following ingredients: - 2 cups (480 ml) of low-fat milk - 1 cup (240 ml) of low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth - 3 cloves of garlic, minced - ¼ cup (30 g) of all-purpose flour - ½ teaspoon of salt (or to taste) - ¼ teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper (or to taste) - ¾ cup (85 g) of grated parmesan cheese - 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter - Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish (optional) Create a slurry for the sauce.  In a small bowl, whisk together ¼ cup (60 ml) of the low-fat milk and all-purpose flour until a smooth paste is formed. This slurry will be used to thicken the sauce without using heavy cream, allowing for a lighter alfredo. Saute garlic and heat the milk mixture.  In a large saucepan, melt the unsalted butter over medium-low heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes or until fragrant but not browned. Gradually whisk in the remaining low-fat milk (1¾ cups or 420 ml), low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth, salt, and black pepper. Increase the heat to medium and allow the liquid to come to a simmer. Thicken the sauce.  Slowly whisk the slurry into the simmering milk mixture, continuously stirring to prevent any clumps from forming. Cook the sauce, continuously stirring, for about 2-3 minutes or until it has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add parmesan cheese.  Remove the saucepan from heat and gradually stir in the grated parmesan cheese until it melts and the sauce is smooth and creamy. Adjust salt and black pepper as needed. Combine the fettuccine and sauce. Add the drained fettuccine to the saucepan with the alfredo sauce and toss gently to coat each noodle evenly. Allow the pasta to absorb some of the sauce for a minute or two before serving. Serve the light fettuccine alfredo. Transfer the pasta to individual serving plates, garnishing with a sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley if desired. Serve immediately while the dish is still warm, accompanied by a salad or steamed vegetables, and a slice of crusty bread to complete your lighter meal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Texans scored first with 5:55 left after Blue caught a pass from Fitzpatrick to lead 7-0. In the second quarter Ben Roethlisberger was sacked by Watt and fumbled the ball near midfield. Houston capitalized on the turnover with a Bullock 39 yard field goal to lead 10-0 with 13:39 left in the 2nd. Houston continued their trend of scoring on each possession with another Bullock field goal (38 yards) to extend their lead to 13-0 with 7:20 left; part of the same drive included the Texans converting on a 4th down and inches. The Steelers finally managed to get on the board with a 44-yard field goal from Shaun Suisham to trail 3-13 with 3:13 left.

It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.  and the situation: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean.

Q:Question: Where is a good place to keep many a pencil? Options: - office depot - cup - pencil shop - shelf - classroom  The answer is \\"cup\\" because A:","output":"The answer is \\"cup\\" because a cup serves as an efficient, convenient, and accessible storage solution for holding multiple pencils in various environments. Let's look at the other options provided and analyze why the cup is the superior choice. 1. Office Depot: While Office Depot is a well-known retail store that sells office supplies, it is not a practical place to keep many pencils, especially when you need to use them regularly. Going to the store every time you need to grab a pencil would be quite inconvenient, and it is not a dedicated storage solution, but instead a place to purchase pencils. 2. Pencil shop: Like Office Depot, a pencil shop is a place to buy pencils rather than keep them. Although you may find a great variety of pencils there, it doesn't provide an immediate storage solution for personal use. Also, going to a pencil shop every time you need a pencil would be time-consuming and impractical. 3. Shelf: A shelf might be a good place to store and display a pencil collection, but it isn't the most convenient or efficient option. Shelves often require more room and offer little assistance in keeping the pencils organized, as they can quickly become cluttered or disorganized. Also, accessing a pencil from a shelf may necessitate reaching for it, which may not be as convenient as picking it up from a cup. 4. Classroom: A classroom is a location where pencils are often used, but it is not a dedicated storage solution. Instead, a classroom usually has multiple storage options, such as desks, drawers, or even cups, which hold pencils. Storing pencils in a classroom without a proper containment method would not be beneficial or organized, making it an unsuitable option. A cup, on the other hand, offers several benefits for storing multiple pencils. It is a versatile and portable solution that can be placed in various environments, such as home offices, classrooms, or workplaces. A cup can easily be moved around, making it convenient when you need to use or share your pencils. Additionally, a cup can hold multiple pencils vertically, which aids in keeping them neat, organized, and easily accessible. In conclusion, a cup is the most suitable option among the choices provided, as it ensures convenience, accessibility, versatility, and organization – qualities that the other alternatives do not offer in terms of pencil storage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Luke Evans, born in 1979, is a Welsh actor and singer known for his powerful performances in both films and stage productions. Evans began his career by starring in numerous West End productions such as \\"Rent,\\" \\"Miss Saigon,\\" and \\"Piaf,\\" eventually transitioning into film acting. He has showcased his acting prowess in various genres, including horror, action, and biopics, giving life to diverse and memorable characters. Some of the notable films in which Luke Evans has appeared include \\"Clash of the Titans\\" (2010), \\"Robin Hood\\" (2010), \\"Immortals\\" (2011), \\"The Three Musketeers\\" (2011), \\"The Raven\\" (2012), \\"The Hobbit\\" trilogy (2012-2014), \\"Dracula Untold\\" (2014), \\"Fast & Furious 6\\" (2013), and \\"Fast & Furious 8\\" (2017). In Disney's \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" Evans' portrayal of Gaston is not just the charming yet arrogant and self-absorbed hunter from the original 1991 animated film but also boasts a more complex and darker side. With his incredible screen presence, Evans manages to give a nuanced performance that showcases Gaston's charming facade while depicting his descent into cruelty and obsession. The 2017 film, directed by Bill Condon, is a live-action retelling of Disney's beloved animated classic, which in turn was an adaptation of the French fairy tale written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve. The film stars Emma Watson as Belle and Dan Stevens as the Beast, with an ensemble cast featuring Kevin Kline, Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson, Ian McKellen, Stanley Tucci, and Audra McDonald, among others. The live-action \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" received positive reviews from both audiences and critics, who praised its visual opulence, vibrant music, and memorable performances.

The equation contains two terms with the variable n: -220n and 30n. Combine these terms by adding them together: -220n + 30n = -190n. So the equation becomes -190n + 1710 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable term. To isolate the variable term -190n, move the constant term (1710) to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: -190n + 1710 - 1710 = 0 - 1710. This simplifies to -190n = -1710. Step 3: Solve for the variable n. To find the value of n, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable term (-190): (-190n) / (-190) = (-1710) / (-190). Both sides of the equation now become: n = 9.

It includes two main clades: Pseudosuchia, which includes crocodilians and their extinct relatives, and Ornithosuchia, which includes birds and their extinct relatives (such as non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs).  - Desmatosuchinae is one of the two subfamilies of aetosaurs, the other being Aetosaurinae. It is a stem-based taxon defined as all aetosaurs more closely related to \\"Desmatosuchus\\" than the last common ancestor of \\"Desmatosuchus\\" and \\"Stagonolepis\\". All synapomorphies that diagnose the clade can be found in the osteoderms. These include tongue-and-groove articulations for lateral plates present in dorsal presacral paramedian plates and large spikes on the lateral cervical, dorsal, and caudal plates.  - Aetosaurinae is one of the two subfamilies of aetosaurs , the other being Desmatosuchinae . It is a stem - based taxon defined as all aetosaurs more closely related to Aetosaurus than to the last common ancestor of Aetosaurus and Desmatosuchus . The only synapomorphy that diagnoses the clade Aetosaurinae is the medial offset of the dorsal eminences of the paramedian osteoderms . A phylogenetic study in 2012 found Aetosaurinae to be paraphyletic , with Aetosaurus being the basal-most stagonolepidid and aetosaurines like Calyptosuchus , Neoaetosauroides , and the newly described Aetobarbakinoides being successively more derived taxa leading up to a clade containing Desmatosuchinae and Typothoracisinae . Under this phylogeny , most traditional aetosaurines are more closely related to Desmatosuchus than they are to Aetosaurus , and the clade Aetosaurinae can only include Aetosaurus .  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - Desmatosuchus (from Greek  \\"desmos\\" 'link' +  \\"soûkhos\\" 'crocodile') is an extinct genus of archosaur belonging to the Order Aetosauria. It lived during the Late Triassic.  - Neoaetosauroides is an extinct genus of primitive aetosaur. Its type and only species is \\"N. engaeus\\". Fossils have been found from the Los Colorados Formation outcropping along the Sierra Morada River in La Rioja, Argentina, and date back to the Norian age of the Late Triassic. It was the first aetosaur known from the formation, with remains being discovered in the 1960s.  - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: ,  - \\"phylé\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race +  - \\"genetikós\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree)  a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes.  - Aetosaurus is an extinct genus of archosaur reptile belonging to the order Aetosauria. It is generally considered to be the most primitive aetosaur. Three species are currently recognized: \\"A. ferratus\\", the type species from Germany and Italy; \\"A. crassicauda\\" from Germany; and \\"A. arcuatus\\" from eastern North America. Additional specimens referred to \\"Aetosaurus\\" have been found from South Africa, the Chinle Group of the southwestern United States, and the Fleming Fjord Formation of Greenland. Specimens of \\"Aetosaurus\\" occur in Norian-age strata.  - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.  - The Late Triassic is the third and final of three epochs of the Triassic Period in the geologic timescale. The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event began during this epoch and is one of the five major mass extinction events of the Earth. The corresponding series is known as the Upper Triassic. In Europe the epoch was called the Keuper, after a German lithostratigraphic group (a sequence of rock strata) that has a roughly corresponding age. The Late Triassic spans the time between Ma and Ma (million years ago). The Late Triassic is divided into the Carnian, Norian and Rhaetian ages.  - Typothoracisinae is a clade of aetosaurs within the subfamily Aetosaurinae. It is a stem-based taxon defined as all aetosaurs closer to \\"Typothorax\\" than to \\"Stagonolepis\\" or \\"Desmatosuchus\\". As with many aetosaur taxa, most of the synapomorphies that diagnose the clade are found in the osteoderms. These include a strongly acute angle of flexion between the dorsal and lateral flanges of the dorsal and lateral plates and triangular-shaped pelvic and anterior caudal dorsal lateral plates possessing semicircular borders and hook-like eminences.  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - Emil Hans Willi Hennig (April 20, 1913  November 5, 1976) was a German biologist who is considered the founder of phylogenetic systematics, also known as cladistics. In 1945 as a prisoner of war, Hennig began work on his theory of cladistics, which he published in 1950. With his works on evolution and systematics he revolutionised the view of the natural order of beings. As a taxonomist, he specialised in dipterans (ordinary flies and mosquitoes).  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - In biology and genealogy, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA, also \\"last common ancestor\\" LCA, or \\"concestor\\") of any set of organisms is the most recent individual from which all organisms in a group, for are directly descended. The term is also used reference to the ancestry of groups of genes (haplotypes) rather than organisms.  - In biological classification, a subfamily (Latin: ', plural ') is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus. Standard nomenclature rules end subfamily botanical names with \\"-oideae\\", and zoological names with \\"-inae\\".  - In phylogenetics, apomorphy and synapomorphy refer to derived characteristic of a clade. Apomorphy implies a characteristic that is different from the form of an ancestor, i.e., an innovation, of use in determining membership in a clade. Synapomorphy is a shared derived character or trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms. In other words, it is an apomorphy shared by members of a monophyletic group, and thus assumed to be present in their most recent common ancestor. The word synapomorphy, coined by German entomologist Willi Hennig, is derived from the Greek words ', \\"syn\\" = shared; ', \\"apo\\" = away from; and \\"\\", \\"morphe\\" = shape.A   - In zoological nomenclature, a type species (\\"species typica\\") is the species name with which the name of a genus or subgenus is considered to be permanently taxonomically associated, i.e., the species that contains the biological type specimen(s). A similar concept is used for suprageneric groups called a type genus.  - Calyptosuchus (meaning \\"covered crocodile\\") is an extinct genus of crurotarsan from the Late Triassic of North America. As an aetosaur, it was heavily armored and had a pig-like snout used to uproot plants. The genus might be a junior synonym of \\"Stagonolepis\\".  - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  - Typothorax is an extinct genus of typothoracisine aetosaur that lived in the Late Triassic. Its remains have been found in North America. Two species are known: \\"T. coccinarum\\", the type species, and \\"T. antiquum\\".  - Stagonolepis is an extinct genus of stagonolepidid aetosaur known from the Late Triassic (Carnian stage) of Europe.  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\".  - Aetosaurs (\\"aetosaur\\" ; order name \\"Aetosauria\\" ; from Greek, (aetos, \\"eagle\\") and (sauros, \\"lizard\\")) are an extinct order of heavily armoured, medium- to large-sized Late Triassic herbivorous archosaurs. They have small heads, upturned snouts, erect limbs, and a body covered by plate-like scutes. All aetosaurs belong to the family Stagonolepididae. Two distinct subdivisions of aetosaurs are currently recognized, Desmatosuchinae and Aetosaurinae, based primarily on differences in the morphology of the bony scutes of the two groups. Over 20 genera of aetosaurs have been described, and recently there has been controversy regarding the description of some of these genera.    What is the relationship between 'aetosaurinae' and 'subfamily'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Aetosaurinae is a subfamily within the family Stagonolepididae. In biological classification, a subfamily is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus. Aetosaurinae, being a subfamily, is a group of more closely related aetosaurs that share certain characteristics and are considered to have a common ancestor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Homecoming Movie plot: This section's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (March 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film begins with Shelby (Mischa Barton) driving at night while crying and smoking a cigarette, which she drops and then hits someone who was standing in the path of the car. Mike (Matt Long), Shelby's ex-boyfriend, has a new girlfriend, Elizabeth (Jessica Stroup), and they are preparing to go to Mt. Bliss, Mike's hometown, because the football team is going to be retiring his jersey. Shelby has problems with the bank about the bowling alley she inherited when her mother died and still believes that she and Mike are still an item. After the football game Mike and Elizabeth decide to go to Shelby's bowling alley. When Shelby sees Mike she kisses him, but Mike tells her that he has a new girlfriend. Shelby befriends Elizabeth and after a few tequila shots, a drunk Elizabeth says she is going to meet Mike's parents after. Shelby then tells her that Mike's parents are over judgmental, making Elizabeth nervous. Wanting to give a good first impression to Mike's parents, Elizabeth decides to go to a motel and sleep her intoxication off, so gets driven to the nearest one from Mike's policeman cousin Billy. As she arrives at check-in, the man behind the counter tells her that there are not any rooms left because of the homecoming football games and the nearest motel is four miles away. Mike goes home to see his mother, who tells him that one of her friends said his new girlfriend got drunk at the alley. Mike tells her that since Elizabeth wanted to make a good impression, she decided to stay at a motel. Mike's mother questions him why Elizabeth would think that, implying that Shelby lied to Elizabeth. Elizabeth begins to walk up the road with her suitcase, looking for someone to drive her to the motel.
