Tom warmed up properly before running. Which runner didn't have an increased heart rate? The answer to this question is:","output":"Neither Tom nor Jim experienced a situation where they did not have an increased heart rate during their run, as engaging in physical activity always results in an increased heart rate. However, the specific circumstances surrounding their warm-up routines could have influenced their heart rate increases differently. Tom chose to warm up properly before running, which is considered the best practice for any physical activity. A proper warm-up prepares the body for exercise, including increasing blood flow to the muscles, warming up body temperature, and gradually increasing the heart rate. By warming up, Tom allowed his heart rate to increase progressively, enabling a smoother transition to the higher intensity demands of running. As a result, Tom was less likely to experience a heart rate spike during his run. Instead, his heart rate would have increased gradually and remained elevated throughout the activity. On the other hand, Jim skipped his warm-up due to being late. Without a warm-up, his body didn't have a chance to prepare for the upcoming physical demands. As a result, Jim's body experienced a more abrupt transition from a resting heart rate to an elevated heart rate. This sudden increase in heart rate could lead to higher levels of discomfort and fatigue, as well as an increased risk of injury during the activity. In conclusion, both Tom and Jim experienced increased heart rates during their run. However, Tom's choice to engage in a proper warm-up resulted in a more controlled and gradual increase in his heart rate, while Jim's decision to skip his warm-up led to a more abrupt and potentially less comfortable increase in heart rate during the activity. To ensure optimal performance and minimize the risk of injury, it is always advised to engage in a proper warm-up before engaging in any form of physical activity."},{"instruction":"Given the question: There is a long history of martial arts competition in Fujian Province of China. Interestingly, one can also place bets on competitors. David is a martial arts enthusiast, watching every martial arts movie he can find. This year David and his friend John is visiting the Fujian Province to see the martial arts competition. There are two rounds of competition, round A and round B. Round A competitors would display southern Chinese martial arts while round B competitors would display northern Chinese martial arts. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would round B display more or less developed qinna techniques? The answer is:","output":"It is difficult to definitively state whether round B would display more or less developed qinna techniques based solely on the information provided in the paragraph. However, we can analyze the differences between northern and southern Chinese martial arts to make an educated guess. Qinna (or Chin Na) is a set of techniques used in Chinese martial arts, focusing on joint locks, grappling, and pressure point manipulation. Both northern and southern Chinese martial arts styles incorporate qinna techniques to some extent, but the emphasis and execution of these techniques may vary between styles and regions. Northern Chinese martial arts are generally characterized by their long-range techniques, acrobatics, and swift footwork. These styles often emphasize powerful kicks, high jumps, and fluid, dynamic movements. On the other hand, southern Chinese martial arts emphasize shorter-range techniques, stability, low stances, and strong, rooted footwork. Southern styles often prioritize hand techniques, close-quarters combat, and solid, powerful strikes. Given these general characteristics, it might be inferred that southern styles, which are showcased in round A of the competition, could potentially place a greater emphasis on qinna techniques due to their focus on short-range, close-quarters combat. These techniques would likely be more integral and fundamental to the southern martial arts displayed in the Fujian Province competition. However, this does not mean that qinna techniques will be entirely absent or less developed in round B, featuring northern Chinese martial arts. The specific development and expertise in qinna techniques displayed during the competition ultimately depend on the individual practitioners and their chosen styles. Some northern martial arts styles might have a strong focus on qinna techniques, whereas others may not. In conclusion, while it is difficult to say definitively, based on the general characteristics of northern and southern Chinese martial arts, it might be surmised that round B could potentially display less developed qinna techniques than round A. However, this assumption is based on generalized characteristics of regional martial arts styles and does not take into consideration the specific styles and their practitioners competing in the event."},{"instruction":"Une cotation appropriée de compensation sera alors attribuée au poste.

Article: On Easter Day, 1722, Dutch explorers landed on Easter Island . It was the first time that Easter Islanders had met people from the outside world. The strangers were about to discover something very strange themselves --that they were on an island with hundreds of huge stone statues . The Dutch explorers wondered where the Islanders had come from and why and how they had built the statues. Now science is putting together the story. The first people to arrive on the island came there around A.D. 700. The society that developed there was based on fishing and farming to feed the population, which grew to 12,000. Its success showed itself in a way that has become the island's trademark : hundreds of huge stone figures --the moai. None of the moai was standing when scientists first arrived. People put them back up later; but how had a Stone Age society ever made, moved and set them up there in the first place? And why? There are nearly 900 moai on Easter Island, and while the questions about them remain unanswered, no one doubts the years of effort that must have gone into making them. The real killer of the Easter Islanders came from across the ocean. After 1722, it became popular for explorers to visit Easter Island, bringing diseases. The final blow came in 1862, when slave traders came from Peru and took away 1,500 people, one-third of the population.

Alejandro Jodorowsky Prullansky (Spanish: [ale'xandro xodo'rofski]; born 17 February 1929) is a Chilean-French filmmaker. Active since 1948, in seventy years of his artistic career Jodorowsky has experienced it in almost all creative forms: writer (in his five facets: novelist, storyteller, poet, playwright and essayist), film director and producer, actor of cinema and theatre, playwright, theatre director, screenwriter, film editor, comics writer, musician, soundtrack composer, philosopher, puppeteer, mime, psychologist and psychoanalyst, draughtsman, painter, eventually sculptor and spiritual guru. Best known for his avant-garde films, he has been \\"venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts\\" for his work which \\"is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation\\". Born to Jewish-Ukrainian parents in Chile, Jodorowsky experienced an unhappy and alienated childhood, and so immersed himself in reading and writing poetry. In 2000, Jodorowsky won the Jack Smith Lifetime Achievement Award from the Chicago Underground Film Festival (CUFF). Jodorowsky attended the festival and his films were shown, including El Topo and The Holy Mountain, which at the time had grey legal status. According to festival director Bryan Wendorf, it was an open question of whether CUFF would be allowed to show both films, or whether the police would show up and shut the festival down. Until 2007, Fando y Lis and Santa Sangre were the only Jodorowsky works available on DVD. Neither El Topo nor The Holy Mountain were available on videocassette or DVD in the United States or the United Kingdom, due to ownership disputes with distributor Allen Klein. After settlement of the dispute in 2004, however, plans to re-release Jodorowsky's films were announced by ABKCO Films. On 19 January 2007, the website, announced that on 1 May 2007, Anchor Bay released a box set including El Topo, The Holy Mountain, and Fando y Lis. A limited edition of the set includes both the El Topo and The Holy Mountain soundtracks. And, in early February 2007, Tartan Video announced its 14 May 2007, release date for the UK PAL DVD editions of El Topo, The Holy Mountain, and the six-disc box set which, alongside the aforementioned feature films, includes the two soundtrack CDs, as well as separate DVD editions of Jodorowsky's 1968 debut feature Fando y Lis (with his 1957 short La cravate a.k.a. Les tetes interverties, included as an extra) and the 1994 feature-length documentary La constellation Jodorowsky. Notably, Fando y Lis and La cravate were digitally restored extensively and remastered in London during late 2006, thus providing the perfect complement to the quality restoration work undertaken on El Topo and The Holy Mountain in the States by Abkco, and ensuring that the presentation of Fando y Lis is a significant improvement over the 2001 Fantoma DVD edition. Prior to the availability of these legitimate releases, only inferior quality, optically censored, bootleg copies of both El Topo and The Holy Mountain have been circulated on the Internet and on DVD. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Jodorowsky attempted to make a sequel to El Topo, called at different times The Sons of El Topo and Abel Cain, but could not find investors for the project. In an interview with Premiere Magazine, Jodorowsky said he intended his next project to be a gangster film called King Shot. In an interview with The Guardian newspaper in November 2009, however, Jodorowsky revealed that he was unable to find the funds to make King Shot, and instead would be entering preparations on Sons of El Topo, for which he claimed to have signed a contract with \\"some Russian producers\\". In 2010, the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City staged the first American cinema retrospective of Alejandro Jodorowsky entitled Blood into Gold: The Cinematic Alchemy of Alejandro Jodorowsky. Jodorowsky would attend the retrospective and hold a master class on art as a way of transformation. This retrospective would inspire the museum MOMA PS1 to present the exhibition Alejandro Jodorowsky: The Holy Mountain in 2011.","output":"This text is about Alejandro Jodorowsky Prullansky, a Chilean-French filmmaker known for his avant-garde films and creative versatility in various forms of art.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Many people often wonder if it's possible to learn a language at a later age and attain a high level of proficiency. When we consider childhood and adolescence, it generally seems more straightforward for individuals to pick up new languages due to factors such as increased neuroplasticity and having more time to practice and learn. As people transition into adulthood, they face various challenges like limited free time, work commitments, and other responsibilities, which might hinder their language-learning abilities. Moreover, in the early years, the brain is more plastic and adaptable, allowing for more natural acquisition of language skills. However, as time goes by, the brain may become less plastic, which could make it harder for people to learn a new language. Despite these challenges, numerous studies and real-life cases have demonstrated that adults can still learn languages and achieve fluency. Factors contributing to successful language acquisition in adulthood may include motivation, perseverance, dedication, consistent practice, and finding suitable learning methods tailored to their unique needs. Additionally, some learners may find it helpful to take advantage of language immersion experiences, such as spending time in a country where the target language is spoken or engaging in conversations with native speakers. In conclusion, while it may be true that younger individuals tend to have an easier time learning languages, it is entirely possible for adults to learn languages as well. The key lies in establishing and maintaining a focused, consistent, and passionate approach to language learning. So, the answer to the question, \\"Is it possible for a person to learn a new language as an adult and achieve fluency?\\" is yes."},{"instruction":"According to his birth certificate he was named Fred King, and his parents were Ella Mae King and J. T. Christian. When Freddie was six years old, his mother and his uncle began teaching him to play the guitar. In autumn 1949, he and his family moved from Dallas to the South Side of Chicago. In 1952 King started working in a steel mill. In the same year he married another Texas native, Jessie Burnett. They had seven children. Almost as soon as he had moved to Chicago, King started sneaking into South Side nightclubs, where he heard blues performed by Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, T-Bone Walker, Elmore James, and Sonny Boy Williamson. King formed his first band, the Every Hour Blues Boys, with the guitarist Jimmie Lee Robinson and the drummer Frank \\"Sonny\\" Scott. In 1952, while employed at a steel mill, the eighteen-year-old King occasionally worked as a sideman with such bands as the Little Sonny Cooper Band and Earl Payton's Blues Cats. In 1953 he recorded with the latter for Parrot Records, but these recordings were never released. As the 1950s progressed, King played with several of Muddy Waters's sidemen and other Chicago mainstays, including the guitarists Jimmy Rogers, Robert Lockwood Jr., Eddie Taylor, and Hound Dog Taylor; the bassist Willie Dixon; the pianist Memphis Slim; and the harmonicist Little Walter. In 1956 he cut his first record as a leader, for El-Bee Records. The A-side was \\"Country Boy\\", a duet with Margaret Whitfield. The B-side was a King vocal. Both tracks feature the guitar of Robert Lockwood, Jr., who during these years was also adding rhythm backing and fills to Little Walter's records. King was repeatedly rejected in auditions for the South Side's Chess Records, the premier blues label, which was the home of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Walter. The complaint was that King sang too much like B.B. King. A newer blues scene, lively with nightclubs and upstart record companies, was burgeoning on the West Side, though. The bassist and producer Willie Dixon, during a period of estrangement from Chess in the late 1950s, asked King to come to Cobra Records for a session, but the results have never been heard. Meanwhile, King established himself as perhaps the biggest musical force on the West Side. He played along with Magic Sam and reputedly played backing guitar, uncredited, on some of Sam's tracks for Mel London's Chief and Age labels, though King does not stand out on them.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Looking for a harder-hitting rock sound than that of All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 began recording their eleventh studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs \\"had no magic\\". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \\"sonic cohesion\\". Released in November 2004, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received favourable reviews from critics. The album featured lyrics touching on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. It reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled those of All That You Can't Leave Behind, setting a personal best for the band. Overall, it sold 9 million copies globally.

In between a series of bank robberies, Dillinger meets Billie Frechette at a restaurant and woos her by buying her a fur coat. Frechette falls for Dillinger even after he reveals his identity, and the two become inseparable. Purvis leads a failed ambush at a hotel where he believes Dillinger is staying, and an agent is killed by Baby Face Nelson, who escapes with Tommy Caroll. Purvis requests that Hoover bring in professional lawmen who know how to catch criminals dead or alive, including Texan Charles Winstead. Police arrest Dillinger and his gang in Tucson, Arizona, after a fire breaks out at the Hotel Congress, where they are staying. Dillinger is extradited to Indiana, where Sheriff Lillian Holley has him locked up in the Lake County Jail in Crown Point. Dillinger and other inmates use a fake gun to escape. Dillinger is unable to see Frechette, who is under tight surveillance. Dillinger learns that Frank Nitti's associates are unwilling to help because his crimes are motivating the FBI to prosecute interstate crime, which imperils Nitti's bookmaking racket, thus severing his connections with the Mafia. Carroll goads Dillinger into robbing a bank in Sioux Falls with Baby Face Nelson. During their escape, both Dillinger and Carroll are shot, and they have to leave Carroll behind. The group retreats to the Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin and realize their haul is significantly less than Nelson said it would be. Dillinger hopes he can free the rest of his gang from prison, including Pierpont and Makley, but Red Hamilton convinces him this is unlikely. Purvis and his men apprehend Carroll and torture him to learn the gang's location. Purvis organizes an ambush at Little Bohemia. Dillinger and Hamilton escape separately...

He was the Ambassador to 1975, but back home in 1898, in New Jerusalem, Utah, they all thought he was Ambassador to France. When he disappeared, Mama and I came back through the triple-bolted door that led from our apt in 1975 to our horsebarn in 1898. We returned to the dusty streets of New Jerusalem, and I had to keep on reminding myself that I was supposed to have been in France, and 'polly-voo' for my chums, and tell whoppers about the Eiffel Tower and the fancy bread and the snails and frogs we'd eaten. I was born in New Jerusalem, and raised there till I was ten. Then, one summer's day, my Pa sat me on his knee and told me we'd be going away for a while, that he had a new job. 'But what about the store?' I said, scandalised. My Pa's wonderful store, the only General Store in town not run by the Saints, was my second home. I'd spent my whole life crawling and then walking on the dusty wooden floors, checking stock and unpacking crates with waybills from exotic places like Salt Lake City and even San Francisco. Pa looked uncomfortable. 'Mr Johnstone is buying it.' My mouth dropped. James H Johnstone was as dandified a city-slicker as you'd ever hope to meet. He'd blown into town on the weekly Zephyr Speedball, and skinny Tommy Benson had hauled his three huge steamer trunks to the cowboy hotel. He'd tipped Tommy two dollars, in Wells-Fargo notes, and later, in the empty lot behind the smithy, all the kids in New Jerusalem had gathered 'round Tommy to goggle at the small fortune in queer, never-seen bills. 'Pa, no!' I said, without thinking. I knew that if my chums ordered their fathers around like that, they'd get a whipping, but my Pa almost never whipped me.

[a]. make sure the chamber is empty, engage safety to not injure anyone, squeeze the trigger. [b]. put a new magazine in the chamber, turn the safety off, aim at your target and squeeze the trigger","output":"[b]. Put a new magazine in the chamber, turn the safety off, aim at your target, and squeeze the trigger. Here is the step-by-step process with justifications for each step: 1. Ensure you are in a safe and appropriate location for shooting a gun, such as a shooting range or other legal space. This is important to avoid accidents, injuries and comply with laws and regulations. 2. Familiarize yourself with the gun's safety features, such as the safety switch and any other manufacturer-specific safety mechanisms. This is important to ensure safe handling and operation of the firearm. 3. Make sure the chamber is empty and no round is in the firing position. This is a safety precaution to eliminate the risk of accidental discharge while loading the magazine. 4. Load the magazine with the correct ammunition for your specific gun. This is essential to ensure proper functionality and prevent damage to the firearm. 5. Insert the loaded magazine into the gun, making sure it is securely and properly seated. This is important for smooth operation and reliable feeding of ammunition. 6. With the safety still engaged, hold the gun with both hands using the appropriate grip, and with the proper stance. This will increase stability and accuracy when shooting. 7. Disengage the safety, ensuring you have clear visibility of your target and there are no unintended objects or people in your line of fire. This is crucial for safety and accuracy. 8. Aim carefully at your target, focusing on the front sight and aligning it with the rear sight, while keeping your target's center of mass in sight. This helps improve accuracy and precision. 9. Steadily squeeze the trigger, applying consistent pressure until the gun fires. Avoid jerking or pulling the trigger abruptly, as this can negatively affect accuracy. 10. After firing, maintain your grip and stance, assess the target, and follow any necessary safety procedures, such as engaging the safety, unloading the gun, or performing a chamber check. This method provides the best approach for safely handling and accurately shooting a gun while maintaining a strong emphasis on safety and precision."},{"instruction":"Lienette huomanneet, että esittelijän puheaika on päättynyt.

It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or molded, or cast. - A metal (from Greek \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire).

And I was wondering What will happen to Casey? Answer:","output":"When Tracy decides to go on a road trip with friends and doesn't invite Casey, several potential consequences and emotions could arise for Casey, depending on their relationship dynamics, reasons behind the decision, and Casey's personality. Here is a detailed analysis of some possibilities that could ensue: 1. Feelings of rejection: One potential outcome for Casey is that they may feel rejected since they weren't included in the road trip. This could result in a deterioration of their self-esteem or feelings of not being good enough to fit in with Tracy's friend group. 2. Strained relationship with Tracy: This situation could create tension between Casey and Tracy. Even if Tracy had their reasons for not inviting Casey, it might leave Casey questioning their friendship and trust with Tracy, leading to a strain in their relationship. 3. Deepening existing insecurities: If Casey already has insecurities about fitting in or being liked by others, Tracy's decision to not include them in the road trip could exacerbate those feelings. This might cause Casey to question their self-worth and worry about how others perceive them. 4. Seeking social support: In response to this event, Casey could start seeking social support from other friends or family members. They might open up about their feelings to gain comfort and validation from those who care about them. 5. Personal growth and introspection: This situation could also be an opportunity for Casey to reflect on their personal growth and self-improvement. They may take this time alone to reassess their priorities, understand their feelings, and find ways to become more self-reliant. 6. Foster new friendships or engage in different activities: To cope with being excluded from Tracy's road trip, Casey might decide to branch out and explore new friendships or take part in different activities. This could lead them to discover new interests, make new connections, and even find a better sense of belonging. 7. Communication and resolution: The ideal course of action for Casey would be to openly communicate with Tracy about their feelings and try to understand the reasons behind Tracy's decision. This could lead to a healthier conversation that either brings resolution to their issues or provides both parties with an understanding of each other's perspectives. 8. Acceptance and moving forward: In the end, Casey may choose to accept the situation and move forward. They could take the high road, understanding that not everything is personal, and that they cannot be included in every plan their friends make. This could result in personal growth, maturity, and even enhanced emotional strength. Ultimately, how Casey reacts to this situation largely depends on their temperament, resilience, emotional intelligence, and their willingness to communicate with Tracy. A candid conversation could help both parties to identify underlying issues, understand each other's motivations, and come to a mutually beneficial outcome."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"I love this app!

This first request by the Ming was made in 1407, but the Ming court sent another embassy in 1413, this one led by the eunuch Hou Xian (候顯; fl. 1403–1427), which was again refused by Tsongkhapa. Rossabi writes that Tsongkhapa did not want to entirely alienate the Ming court, so he sent his disciple Chosrje Shākya Yeshes to Nanjing in 1414 on his behalf, and upon his arrival in 1415 the Yongle Emperor bestowed upon him the title of \\"State Teacher\\"—the same title earlier awarded the Phagmodrupa ruler of Tibet. The Xuande Emperor (r. 1425–1435) even granted this disciple Chosrje Shākya Yeshes the title of a \\"King\\" (王). This title does not appear to have held any practical meaning, or to have given its holder any power, at Tsongkhapa's Ganden Monastery.

The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including \\"When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home\\". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing \\"Shine!\\" and Williams screaming \\"Hey!\\". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, \\"So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation\\" and \\"that bear with the red hat\\", as obvious references to Paddington.

The Korean War, which took place from June 25, 1950, until the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953, was a result of a complex interplay of political, military, and ideological factors that emerged in the wake of World War II. The war had its roots in the Cold War geopolitics, Korean national interests, and the internal conflict between North and South Korea. Moreover, the war’s consequences extended beyond the Korean Peninsula, shaping global politics, regional stability, and the contemporary relationship between the two Koreas. Causes of the Korean War: 1. Division of Korea: The end of World War II led to the division of Korea at the 38th parallel. This arbitrary partition was a result of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, as both powers occupied the Korean Peninsula following Japan's defeat. This division led to the creation of two separate governments: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) under Soviet influence, and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) backed by the United States. 2. Ideological differences: As part of the larger Cold War conflict, the Korean War was influenced by the contest between the communist and capitalist ideologies. North Korea's Kim Il-sung, supported by the Soviet Union and China, aimed to spread communism throughout the peninsula. Conversely, South Korea, under the leadership of Syngman Rhee and supported by the United States, sought to extend capitalism and democracy to the entire region. 3. Struggle for unification: Both North and South Korea harbored ambitions to reunite the divided peninsula under their respective political systems. Kim Il-sung was determined to orchestrate a military invasion of South Korea to achieve unification, while Rhee often espoused aggressive rhetoric about invading North Korea. This push for unification played a crucial role in igniting the conflict. 4. International factors: Beyond the struggle for Korea, the war reflected global power dynamics. The Soviet Union’s support for North Korea, including military aid and training, encouraged Kim Il-sung to undertake military action. Meanwhile, the United States, fearing the spread of communism in Asia, saw the invasion as a direct challenge to its policy of containment and subsequently intervened in the conflict. Consequences of the Korean War: 1. Humanitarian toll: The war resulted in a devastating humanitarian crisis, leading to nearly 5 million casualties, the majority of which were Korean civilian deaths. The conflict also generated countless refugees and separated families across the 38th parallel. 2. Division of the peninsula: Despite fighting to a stalemate, the war consolidated the division of the Korean Peninsula, entrenching the North and South Korean governments in their respective territories. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement led to the establishment of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a heavily fortified buffer zone that separates the two nations to this day. 3. Economic divergence: In the aftermath of the war, South Korea, with significant support from the United States, transformed its war-torn economy into a modern industrial powerhouse. In contrast, North Korea experienced economic stagnation under dictatorial rule, relying on aid from China and the Soviet Union to maintain a heavily militarized society. 4. Global politics: The Korean War escalated tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, intensifying the Cold War. Additionally, the conflict marked a milestone in U.S. and Chinese relations, as China's intervention on North Korea's behalf led to increased hostility between the two superpowers for decades to come. 5. Contemporary challenges: The unresolved nature of the war continues to shape the volatile relationship between North and South Korea. Tensions along the DMZ persist, with numerous incidents and skirmishes occurring over the years. North Korea's nuclear program and its pursuit of long-range missile technology further fuel regional instability, prompting international sanctions and diplomatic efforts to denuclearize the peninsula."},{"instruction":"Please capitalize where necessary: step 3: after file is repaired select the desired location, where you want to save the fixed rar file and then click on \\"save\\" option as shown in figure c.","output":"Step 3: After file is repaired, select the desired location, where you want to save the fixed RAR file and then click on \\"Save\\" option as shown in Figure C.

Both sentences involve \\"two men.\\" 2. The main action in both sentences is \\"fighting.\\" 3. The second sentence specifies the type of fighting (\\"using a form of martial arts\\"), which is not mentioned in the first sentence. Step-by-step analysis: 1. Start with a baseline similarity score of 0. 2. Add 1 point for each matching element. In this case, we have two matching elements: \\"two men\\" and \\"fighting.\\" So, add 2 points (0+1+1=2). 3. Assess additional details in the sentences and determine if they are significant enough to alter the similarity score. In this case, the mention of \\"martial arts\\" is a detail that further specifies the second sentence, but the core action and subjects are still the same (fighting and two men).

But in the [latest results] we see no sign of a bump, there's nothing. \\"It is a pity because it would have been a really fantastic thing if there had been a new particle.\\" Speaking to journalists in Chicago at the International Conference on High Energy Physics (ICHEP), Prof Charlton said it was a remarkable coincidence - but purely a coincidence - that two separate LHC detectors, Atlas and CMS, picked up matching \\"bumps\\". \\"It just seems to be a statistical fluke, that the two experiments saw something at the same mass. \\"Coincidences are always strange when they happen - but we've been looking very hard at our data to make sure we fully understand them, and we don't see anything in the new sample.\\" Prof Fabiola Gianotti, director general of Cern, which runs the LHC, said her team was \\"just at the beginning\\" of a journey and emphasised the collider's technical success. \\"The superb performance of the LHC accelerator, experiments and computing bode extremely well for a detailed and comprehensive exploration of the [new] energy scale, and significant progress in our understanding of fundamental physics,\\" she said. Prof Jon Butterworth from University College London, who also works on the Atlas experiment, said that he and his fellow researchers will now have to work a lot harder to discover a family of new particles that they believe must be out there. \\"If you imagine we have landed on a new island of physics and we are scanning the landscape - if we don't see anything this year, it means that there are no amazing new civilisations with huge cities; there are no spectacular volcanoes there that we see with our first flyby. \\"But it doesn't mean that there is not something hiding in the undergrowth that we will find later. It just means that we will have to do that slowly and carefully and really have to do our job over the next months and years.\\" iWonder: What will the LHC discover next? LHC: The quest to 'break physics' Scientists at the LHC discovered the Higgs Boson four years ago. That particle was a long-standing prediction of the current theory of subatomic physics - the Standard Model. Their aim since then has been to search for evidence of phenomena beyond that model. The Standard Model elegantly explains how particles combine and interact to create the world around us. It also explains how the forces of nature such as electricity and magnetism work, as well as how nuclear forces operate to hold atoms together. But for all its successes, physicists now know that the model explains a tiny corner of our existence - just 4% of the Universe. It does not explain how gravity works, and it does not cover dark matter - the mysterious substance that accounts for more than a quarter of the Universe. It also fails to explain dark energy, which accounts for some two-thirds of the Universe. The LHC was built to explore those unknowns and search for new physics, in the hope of developing theories that would explain how the bulk of the Universe works. Any such discovery would herald the biggest revolution in physics for a hundred years. Hints of a new particle last December - from CMS and Atlas, two of the main detectors at the LHC - generated huge excitement in the particle physics community. There was a \\"bump\\" in the data which could have been a statistical fluke - but it just might have been the first evidence of the new physics researchers had been waiting for. Earlier this year, the revamped LHC finally reached its full operating potential and was set to collect data from collisions at an unprecedented rate. Thousands of scientists at Cern were hoping that they might be on the verge of one of the all-time biggest discoveries in science - even bigger than the Higgs. But despite knocking on the portal to a new realm of physics harder than they had ever knocked before, they found that the door was still firmly shut. The experiment wore on and the bump disappeared. Irregularities like this come and go in particle physics, so it didn't come as a huge surprise to the scientists, but there was obvious disappointment. Inside Cern As well as having analytical minds, these physicists naturally also have passionate, beating hearts. Their disappointment was palpable according to Thomas Hewitson, an assistant producer for BBC2's Horizon programme. Thomas and his colleagues filmed the LHC researchers during those tantalising few months. \\"When we first visited in May there was a real buzz about the 'bump',\\" he said. \\"They're scientists, so they knew it was too early to pop the champagne, but even the most cautious among them went giddy when they allowed themselves to imagine a brand new particle. They hoped they were re-writing the textbooks. \\"So when they saw that the bump had gone... they looked devastated. They are good experimentalists, and so they had always said it might be nothing. But they're only human, and the disappointment was obvious.\\" So how long before the LHC discovers new physics? According to Prof Charlton, if scientists don't see something soon, they may have to settle in for the long haul. \\"If we don't see new particles this year we may need to run for quite some more years to get significant observations of new particles,\\" he told BBC News. In that event, the team will have to look for more subtle indications than an obvious bump in the data - which, Prof Charlton said, was \\"almost too good to have been true\\". \\"Most of the models for new physics predict rather more complex things. It is not likely to be that easy and we'll have to look for more complex signatures then it can take a lot longer\\". If new particles will be hard to find, then one popular theory called supersymmetry looks to be in trouble. The idea, cherished by many theoretical physicists, is that the new particles the LHC has yet to discover are heavier, \\"super\\" versions of the ones we know about. According to Prof Butterworth, it's a theory that refuses to die. \\"I hate to describe it as a 'zombie theory' but it is never going to be absolutely ruled out. But every time we look and we don't find any obvious sign of it then it becomes a little less plausible.\\" Another possibility is that the existing Standard Model might have more life in it, he added. \\"The theoretical arguments to say that it does not work [in the realm of new physics] might be flawed and we might have more to understand just from the Standard Model.\\" The LHC has taken physicists into a new territory and a paradigm shift in our thinking is still very much in the offing. But it is going to take a little longer than many had hoped. Follow Pallab on Twitter Inside Cern, a Horizon special programme tracking the search for the new particle will be broadcast on BBC2 at 20:00 on Wednesday 10 August.

With the bump gone, the scientists are back to square one, searching for a new family of particles.

If she gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet, how many dogs does she remain with altogether? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Let's think step-by-step and justify our answer. Step 1: Understanding the problem Heloise has dogs and cats in the ratio of 10:17 and we know that the total number of pets she has is 189. We need to find out the number of dogs she has remaining after giving 10 dogs to Janet. Step 2: Determine the ratio sums We need to add the ratio values together to determine the total amount that represents both dogs and cats. The ratio is 10:17 so, 10 (for dogs) + 17 (for cats) = 27 Step 3: Determine the number of dogs and cats Since there are 27 parts in the ratio and the total pets are 189, we can divide the total pets by the ratio sum to find out what 1 part is equal to: 1 part = 189 ÷ 27, which equals to 7. Now we can use this number to determine how many of each type of pet she has: dogs: 10 parts × 7 = 70 cats: 17 parts × 7 = 119 So, Heloise has 70 dogs and 119 cats originally. Step 4: Calculate the number of dogs remaining after giving away 10 Heloise gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet, so we need to subtract that number from the original number of dogs she had: Remaining dogs = 70 (original dogs) - 10 (dogs given away) = 60 After giving 10 dogs to Janet, Heloise remains with 60 dogs altogether."},{"instruction":"If I tell you that Flowers require insects, and ask you the question \\"flowers require _.\\", is the correct answer \\"sugar\\"?

Stoker wrote the book after reading stories about Central European vampires and set his novel in Transylvania. Even today,there are readers of the book who believe that Transylvania is a mythical country,a figment of Stoker's imagination. Nothing could be further from the truth. Transylvania is part of modern-day Central European country Romania,and the country does indeed have a history of mythological vampires. However,Romanians are always puzzled by the description of the novel's central character, Count Dracula,a tall,elegant aristocrat with impeccable manners who also happens to speak very good English. This is a world away from the images of vampires that they have grown up with. Romanian vampires are half-human creatures who live solitary lives in the forests,not aristocrats living in castles with well-stocked libraries. So where did Stoke get the image for his Dracula? The answer becomes clearer when one learns of his relationship with a man called Henry Irving,the greatest British stage actor of his time. Stoker was working as a civil servant in his home city of Dublin when he first met Irving. Bored with his tedious life and work, Stoker took every opportunity to visit the theatre and for a while was the drama critic for the Dublin Evening Mail. One of the reviews he wrote was of a performance of Shakespeare's play Hamlet,with Irving in the lead role. Irving was so pleased with Stoker's review of his performance that he asked to meet him. Stoker couldn't believe his luck when one night,he was invited to a dinner party where Irving was the guest of honour. Irving entertained the assembled dinner guests with some renditions of famous poems and speeches from Shakespeare. Stoker was already writing the first chapters of Dracula and began to base the central character on Irving,in the vain hope that if it ever became a stage play,... Question: What was Stoker's hope? Yes or no, is the answer \\"That Irving would play the central character in the stage play.\\"?","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"That Irving would play the central character in the stage play.\\" Stoker's hope was that if his novel Dracula ever became a stage play, Henry Irving, the greatest British stage actor of his time, would play the central character, Count Dracula."},{"instruction":"What is the answer: \\"Whose \\"\\"family\\"\\" was Squeaky Fromme a part of?\\"","output":"To find the answer to this question, I need to search for information about Squeaky Fromme and identify the \\"family\\" she was a part of.

Delius was born in Bradford in Yorkshire. He was baptised as \\"Fritz Theodor Albert Delius\\", and used the forename Fritz until he was about 40. He was the second of four sons (there were also ten daughters) born to Julius Delius (1822–1901) and his wife Elise Pauline, née Krönig (1838–1929). Delius's parents were born in Bielefeld, Westphalia, of Dutch origin; the family had for some generations been settled in German lands near the Rhine. Julius's father, Ernst Friedrich Delius, had served under Blücher in the Napoleonic Wars. Julius moved to England to further his career as a wool merchant, and became a naturalised British subject in 1850. He married Elise in 1856.The Delius household was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, and played for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz was drawn to the music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music of Mozart and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hallé Orchestra, and had more advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of Leeds. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the International College at Isleworth (just west of London) between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to the city for Delius to be able to attend concerts and opera.Julius Delius assumed that his son would play a part in the family wool business, and for the next three years he tried hard to persuade him to do so. Delius's first job was as the firm's representative in Stroud in Gloucestershire,... Answer:","output":"The article provided does not specifically mention the full names of the people that influenced Fritz Theodor Albert Delius in Sweden. It does, however, mention several musicians and individuals who had an impact on Delius's life and musical development, such as Joseph Joachim, Carlo Alfredo Piatti, Rudolph Bauerkeller, George Haddock, Chopin, Grieg, and John Coates. These influential figures helped shape Delius's musical preferences and contributed to his education and growth as a musician. Among these, Chopin and Grieg were particularly important, as the article states that Delius favored their music over the Austro-Germanic compositions of Mozart and Beethoven. It is essential to note that Delius studied and worked in various places, including England (Bradford, Isleworth, and Stroud), Germany, and eventually France, where he settled and gained recognition as a composer. The article does not mention Delius spending a significant amount of time in Sweden or being influenced by specific Swedish individuals. Further research may be required to determine the exact individuals who impacted Delius during his time in Sweden or if there were any Swedish influences on his music."},{"instruction":"Data: Pakistan LEADER_NAME Mamnoon Hussain; Lahore COUNTRY Pakistan; Allama Iqbal International Airport CITY_SERVED Lahore What would a sentence about this data be like?","output":"The leader of Pakistan, named Mamnoon Hussain, lives in a country that has a big city called Lahore, and this city has a big airport for airplanes called Allama Iqbal International Airport where people can fly to different places."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Breaking Up<br>Tom hated his girlfriend.

Answer the following question: What might happen without the writer 's driving instructions ?","output":"Without the writer's driving instructions, several potential outcomes could arise depending on the skill of the sister, her level of experience, and the specific driving situation, among other factors. The following is an extensive analysis of some of the possible scenarios that could emerge in the absence of the writer's guidance: 1. Improved Self-Confidence: If the sister is a newly-licensed driver or someone who has limited driving experience, allowing her to drive without immediate instruction might boost her self-confidence and encourage independent decision-making. Learning to rely on her instincts and handle situations without guidance can be essential to her growth and development as a driver. 2. Greater On-Road Experience: Driving without continuous instructions can offer the sister more practical experience and improve her driving skills in the long run. More time spent on the road under different conditions could further her ability to adapt to new situations and enhance her overall competence as a driver. 3. Potential Mistakes: A lack of guidance might also lead to the sister making mistakes while driving. Without timely instructions, she may commit errors such as forgetting to use signals, taking the wrong exit, forgetting to adjust her mirrors, or failing to perform essential safety checks before embarking on the journey. Some of these mistakes can be minor infractions, while others could potentially lead to dangerous situations for the passengers and other road users. 4. Increased Risk of Accidents: Without the writer's driving instructions, the risk of accidents might increase, especially if the sister is a novice. In this scenario, her inexperience combined with a lack of guidance could elevate the danger factor. This risk could be associated with poor decision-making, lack of awareness of road rules, or suboptimal reaction to certain traffic situations, such as heavy traffic, changing lanes, or sharing the road with aggressive drivers. 5. Increased Traffic Violations: In the absence of the writer's guidance, the sister could inadvertently violate traffic rules or make mistakes that lead to costly fines or legal issues. For instance, she could potentially speed, fail to yield, or inadvertently run a red light. Repeated or severe traffic violations could have major implications, including increased insurance premiums, a tarnished driving record, or even a suspended or revoked driver's license. 6. Delayed Skill Development: While the sister may be given the opportunity to drive independently without the writer's instructions, this could also mean that she is not receiving important feedback that could help her improve as a driver. This might lead to inconsistent development or the reinforcement of bad habits that could take longer to unlearn over time. In conclusion, the absence of the writer's driving instructions may produce a wide range of outcomes, both positive and negative. While the sister might gain self-confidence and improve her driving skills, there's also the possibility of making mistakes, accidents, traffic violations, and potentially delayed skill development. The specific outcome would depend upon factors such as the sister's driving ability, level of experience, and the particular driving situation at hand."},{"instruction":"Where can I find a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy and federation?

Options: - sit down - closing eyes - relax - sleep - have dreams Please answer and provide answer explanation.","output":"Closing eyes, relax, and sleep are good options to relieve strain after being in front of a computer all day. Sitting down might not be as effective, since you could still be on your computer. Having dreams often happen naturally during sleep, so I won't consider it as a separate option. Explanation: 1. Closing eyes: Giving your eyes a break by closing them can help reduce eye strain, especially when spending long hours in front of a computer screen. This can help alleviate symptoms associated with Computer Vision Syndrome, such as dryness, irritation, and fatigue. 2. Relax: Taking breaks to relax and engage in activities that don't require screen time can help reduce overall strain on the body and mind. Stretching, going for a walk, or practicing deep breathing exercises are examples of relaxation activities. 3. Sleep: Ensuring adequate and quality sleep is important for the body's recovery and overall well-being. Sleep helps the body repair and rejuvenate, allowing it to function efficiently during wakeful hours. Adequate rest can also help prevent strain due to fatigue. Meanwhile, sitting down doesn't necessarily remove the strain, especially if you're still using a computer. And having dreams, which occurs during sleep, is not a separate actionable option."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water. Bobby and Ned are two neighbors who both have medium sized gardens in their backyards. They regularly talk to each other about what they are growing and share gardening tips. Bobby is out working in his garden when Ned comes over to chat. Ned mentions that the garden at his house is currently flooded, but he's not sure why since it didn't rain. He asks him if Bobby's garden experienced the same thing. Bobby replies that his garden is not currently flooded. He does mention that he did see Ned's daughter walking around near Ned's garden carrying a hose turned on to full power. Who has more anaerobic bacteria in their garden's soil? Answer:","output":"Ned has more anaerobic bacteria in his garden's soil due to the flooding, which creates a hypoxic environment where anaerobic bacteria thrive."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Big Enos Burdette (Pat McCormick) is running for Governor of Texas against another candidate, John Coen (David Huddleston).

It is a weird story about a nutty millionaire, who is in danger of losing his money to an assembly of the sleaziest twits you could possibly imagine. While there are many very funny asides, such as his love of Kilgore Troustian conceptions or the characterizations of the evil guys (one's posterior is \\"luminous when wet\\"), the plot is weak and far-fetched. For example, Rosewater's grandfather built his massive fortune by buying companies in accordance with their acronyms from the Bible's text! That is too silly to be satire. Moreover, Vonnegut's laments about the coldness and brutality of American capitalism are sentimental and even ignorant. He seems to have an obsession with rich people and money.Not recommended.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: What did Hooker pay Snyder with? Movie title: The Sting Movie plot: It is 1936 and a money runner is carrying the week's take -- 11,000 -- from an illegal gambling outfit in Joliet, Illinois, to the main office. On the way, three men con him by replacing his money with tissue paper. Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), the mobster who was supposed to get the money, exacts revenge by having one of the con men, Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones), murdered. Lonnegan also orders a hit on Luther's partner, Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford). Hooker goes to Chicago to escape Lonnegan's wrath. In Chicago he meets Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman), an old friend of Luther's. To revenge Luther's death, they set up an elaborate plan -- a \\"long con\\" -- to swindle an enormous sum out of Lonnegan so neatly that he won't even realize he's been conned.Posing as an obnoxious gambling boss from Chicago, Gondorff gets into a high-stakes poker game with Lonnegan, who is known to cheat. Gondorff cheats better and wins 15,000 from Lonnegan -- but Lonnegan can't pay it right away because his wallet is missing. (One of Gondorff's associates picked his pocket before the game.) Gondorff sends Hooker to Lonnegan's room to pick up the money. Hooker, playing Gondorff's resentful second-in-command, tells Lonnegan he has a great plan to con Gondorff, but he needs \\"someone respectable\\" to place the bets. Lonnegan, furious at being out-cheated, bites.Gondorff and company do a lot of fast work to get ready for the final phase of the long con. First they assemble a mob and rent an empty basement, transforming it in a couple of days into a prosperous gambling parlor. An announcer in a back room describes horse races as if they were happening live -- but he's reading from a ticker tape, so the results are known in advance. They choose a race with odds they like -- maybe 3:1 or 4:1 -- and call in a tip (a particular horse or horses to win, place, or show) to the pay phone at the corner drugstore, where Lonnegan is waiting. Gondorff's gang has also rented a room with a view of the corner drugstore; when Lonnegan comes out on... The answer is:","output":"Hooker paid Snyder with counterfeit money. In the movie \\"The Sting,\\" Johnny Hooker, played by Robert Redford, is part of an elaborate plan to con mobster Doyle Lonnegan, played by Robert Shaw. One of the components of the plan involves Hooker working with Henry Gondorff, played by Paul Newman, and their team to create a fake gambling parlor. As the plot unfolds, Gondorff pretends to be an obnoxious gambling boss from Chicago and gets involved in a high-stakes poker game with Lonnegan, who has a reputation for cheating. Gondorff outsmarts Lonnegan, winning 15,000 from him. However, Lonnegan cannot pay Gondorff right away because his wallet has been stolen by one of Gondorff's associates. In order to collect the money, Gondorff sends Hooker to Lonnegan's room. Hooker, acting as Gondorff's disgruntled second-in-command, uses this opportunity to pitch his own plan to con Gondorff out of his winnings. He tells Lonnegan that he needs \\"someone respectable\\" to place the bets, and Lonnegan, angry about being out-cheated, agrees to participate. To further the con, Hooker and his team create a fake gambling parlor, where races are chosen, and results are obtained from a ticker tape. They call in a tip to the payphone at the corner drugstore where Lonnegan waits. Watching from a rented room nearby, the team keeps an eye on Lonnegan's movements. Throughout the film, Hooker and his team use various forms of deception and counterfeit materials, such as the fake gambling parlor and the stolen wallet, to manipulate Lonnegan and successfully carry out their \\"long con.\\" In this case, Hooker pays Snyder with counterfeit money as part of their elaborate plan to swindle Lonnegan."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"We are saying 'no' to the disbursement of funds that are used simply to strengthen corrupt politicians, unscrupulous businessmen and organised crime; 'yes' to European money if a credible, environmentally friendly waste plan is put forward; 'no' to uncontrolled landfill in national parks; 'no' to dioxin-producing incinerators; and 'yes' to recycling and environmentally friendly methods.\\" to Romanian?","output":"To translate the given text into Romanian, I will divide the sentence into smaller parts and then translate each part.

The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\".

On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were... Guess a valid title for it!

A mother, who wanted to create an extravagant cake for her daughter's fourth birthday, went all out - by baking a four foot tall Peppa Pig cake. Devoted Maria Young spent four days creating the 133,000-calorie treat to look like piglet George. She got builder husband Wayne to make a wooden frame and then covered it in sponge, icing and Rice Krispies. It's life size! Brooke Young's mother Maria, created the extravagant Peppa Pig themed cake for Brooke's fourth birthday. The end result was a cake taller than daughter Brooke, which at five and a half stone, weighed as much as a ten year-old and was enough to feed 700 people. But thrifty Maria, 30, says it cost her just £100 after she took advantage of as many multi-buy offers as she could find. She melted 17 bags of marshmallow into almost 12 boxes of Rice Krispies to create the legs and head, which alone weighed in excess of 15lbs. Quite a mouthful: Maria's hard work resulted in a cake weighing five and a half stone. Good effort! Maria, 30, spent four days creating the 133,000-calorie treat to look like piglet George. She then baked five 12-inch vanilla sponge cakes, using 4lbs of flour, 4lbs of sugar, 4lbs of butter and three dozen large eggs. She covered the big cake in almost 9lbs of buttercream, using 3lbs of butter and 6lbs of icing sugar. Finally the whole thing was coated in 28lbs of icing made from 22lbs of fondant, 4lbs of icing sugar and 4lbs of butter - and six full bottles of food dye. Brooke, her sister Emily, eight, and brother Logan, nine, helped put the cake together in the lounge of their home in Dorking, Surrey. Hungry? Maria's masterpiece was enough to feed 700 people. Calorific: Doctors recommend girls aged four need 1200 calories every day, meaning the huge cake contains enough calories to feed little Brooke for more than 110 days. Enough to go around: Maria cut 40 portions of cake at the party and she says it barely made a dent. It was unveiled on Tuesday night at daughter Brooke's fourth birthday party in front of dozens of stunned family and friends. Maria said: 'I'm so proud of this cake. It took absolutely ages, but that's what Brooke wanted. 'I asked her what she wanted for her birthday and said she wanted a super tall George cake. 'I'm surprised she didn't want Peppa, but I didn't want to argue - making trousers out of icing is much easier than making a dress.' She added: 'The party was brilliant, everyone was talking about the cake. We must have cut out about 40 portions of the cake, and it barely made a dent. Chuffed: Brooke Young blows out the candles on her amazing birthday cake, created by her mother in four days. Slow and steady: The gigantic cake took Maria four days to construct. Prepared to share: Maria says that any leftover cake will be taken to local food banks. 'All my children have taken about 30 more servings each to school for their classmates, and Wayne took about ten big slabs to work for his mates. 'But even after all that, we've still got well over half of it left. I'm going to speak to my local food bank and ask if I can donate some cake to them.' Maria, who has no formal baking training, is planning on setting up her own bakery, specialising in massive cakes. Earlier this year for Emily's birthday, Maria made a My Little Pony cake containing 250,000 calories. She said: 'George was much more difficult than the pony cake, because it involved a lot more sculpting and precision work. 'After the pony, I vowed to never go baking mad again, but when Brooke asked for a special cake like her sister's, I just couldn't say no.'

In the hypothesis, there is a man who is sleeping.

The Labor Department says the unemployment rate rose to 8.3 percent from 8.2 percent in June. July's hiring was the best since February. Still, the economy has added an average of 151,000 jobs a month this year, roughly the same as last year's pace. That's not enough to satisfy the 12.8 million Americans who are unemployed. The rate increased because the government uses two surveys: A survey of businesses showed job gains, but a survey of households showed fewer people had jobs. Economists say the business survey is more reliable. High unemployment could hurt President Barack Obama's re-election hopes. No president since World War II has faced re-election with unemployment over 8 percent. |||||","output":"On the first Friday of the month, the U.S. employment situation for July was released, revealing that 163,000 jobs were added, which is a positive sign after three months of slow hiring.

Located in Egypt, on the Giza Plateau near Cairo, the Great Pyramid is an awe-inspiring and enduring symbol of the ingenuity and architectural prowess of the ancient Egyptians. The list of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World was compiled by ancient Greek historians and included the following structures: 1. Great Pyramid of Giza (Egypt) 2. Hanging Gardens of Babylon (Iraq) 3. Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (Turkey) 4. Statue of Zeus at Olympia (Greece) 5. Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (Turkey) 6. Colossus of Rhodes (Greece) 7. Lighthouse of Alexandria (Egypt) Unfortunately, all of the other six wonders have been destroyed due to various factors, including earthquakes, fires, and human conflict over the centuries. The Great Pyramid, however, has managed to withstand the test of time and continues to stand as a testament to ancient Egyptian civilization. Constructed during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu in the Fourth Dynasty around 2580-2560 BCE, the Great Pyramid was built as a royal tomb for the pharaoh and was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. With an original height of approximately 146.5 meters (481 feet) and a base measuring 230 meters (755 feet) on each side, the Great Pyramid was an incredible feat of engineering that required precise planning, design, and execution. The massive structure was composed of more than 2.3 million limestone and granite blocks, some weighing as much as 80 tons, and it is believed that it took around 20 years to complete the pyramid. The construction techniques used to build the Great Pyramid remain the subject of significant debate among historians and archaeologists, but it is generally accepted that a combination of ramps, levers, counterweights, and a highly skilled labor force were utilized to build this monumental structure. While the outer casing stones of polished limestone that once adorned the pyramid have been mostly removed or eroded over time, the Great Pyramid's core structure remains intact, ensuring that the oldest and most iconic of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World can still be seen and appreciated by people today. In modern times, the Great Pyramid of Giza has continued to intrigue and captivate scholars, tourists, and researchers alike. This incredible ancient monument sparks curiosity and admiration not only for its impressive size and design but also for its intricate inner chambers, which include the King's Chamber, the Queen's Chamber, and the Great Gallery. Scientific research, archeological exploration, and remarkable technological advances such as the use of robots to explore inaccessible areas continue to reveal new and exciting secrets about the Great Pyramid and its construction. In conclusion, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only wonder of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today. Its durability, stunning architecture, and the many intriguing mysteries surrounding its construction, continue to captivate and inspire people from all around the world."},{"instruction":"2 With respect to the \\"Cranial forms of the American aborigines,\\" see Dr. Aitken Meigs in 'Proc.

The first step is rest — stop all exacerbating activity in order to address your injury, at least for a few days or so. More rest (a few weeks) may be needed depending on the severity of your back injury. For a backache, laying on your back with your knees bent and legs slightly elevated is a good idea because it can take the pressure off the low back joints and provide some pain relief. Laying on your back for hours at a time is not a good idea, either. Get up at least once an hour to move around even a little bit, and try going for a leisurely walk every day. Avoid excessive sitting (more than 30 minutes at a time) because it puts more pressure on the low back joints and may further irritate them. Cold therapy (ice wrapped in a thin towel or frozen gel packs) should be applied to the injury as soon as possible in order to stop reduce inflammation. Ice should be applied for 10 – 15 minutes every hour, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside. Compressing the ice against your back will help to further combat the inflammation. Backaches from joint sprains are usually described as sharp and shooting in nature and they tend to be fairly debilitating. Most range of motion in the affected area is lost, and walking, sitting and sleeping are noticeably impaired. People with spinal joint sprains usually walk hunched over and to the side because the muscles surrounding the affected joints quickly spasm to \\"guard\\" the injury. Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists that focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae, called spinal facet joints. Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition facet joints that are slightly misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain, particularly with movement. You can often hear a \\"popping\\" sound with a spinal adjustment, similar in concept to when you extend your knuckles. Traction techniques or stretching of your spine may also help. Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your back sprain, more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results. If uneven leg lengths or flat feet is deemed to be the primary cause of your backache, then your doctor or chiropractor may recommend orthotics, which are custom made shoe inserts that support the arches, promote better biomechanics when running or walking, and help alleviate back pain. A facet joint injection involves real-time fluoroscopic (X-ray) guidance of a needle through the back muscles and into the inflamed or irritated spinal joint, followed by a release of an anesthetic and corticosteroid mixture, which quickly relieves both pain and inflammation at the site. Facet joint injections take 20 – 30 minutes to do and the results can last from a few weeks to a few months. Facet joint injections are limited to three within a six-month time frame. The pain relief benefits from facet joint injections typically begin on the second or third day post treatment. Until that time frame, your backache may get a little worse. Summary:","output":"To help a backache, rest and stop activities that hurt, lay with knees bent, move a bit every hour, use cold therapy, and see a specialist who might suggest treatments like adjustments, orthotics, or joint injections."},{"instruction":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: Then our team of sports scientists serious athletes and service technicians of many years of experience evaluate the products of different categories","output":"Then, our team of sports scientists, serious athletes, and service technicians, with many years of experience, evaluate the products of different categories."},{"instruction":"Here is an article: Updated AUG 1, 2015 at 9:13a ET U.S. Olympic leaders have started contacting Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington about the possibility of bidding for the 2024 Games and believe the demise of Boston's candidacy will be \\"ancient history\\" by the time the host city is selected in 2017. In an interview Saturday with The Associated Press, U.S. Olympic Committee chairman Larry Probst said a decision will be made by the end of August on which of three cities should replace Boston as the American contender in a race that already features four European cities. \\"We've got to reconnect with the three cities that were part of the group of finalists,\\" Probst said on the sidelines of the IOC general assembly in Kuala Lumpur. \\"We've got to determine what their level of interest is in pursuing a bid and take that feedback and gather our board together and discuss that feedback with our board and make a decision.\\" \\"That will all happen in the month of August,\\" he added. \\"We will have resolved this by the end of the month.\\" Probst gave his most extensive public comments since the USOC cut ties with Boston on Monday, pulling the plug on a bid plagued by a lack of public support. The USOC now faces a Sept. 15 IOC deadline to enter a bid that would replace Boston, which had been chosen ahead of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington. Los Angeles, which hosted the 1932 and 1984 Olympics, is widely viewed as the likely choice. \\"We'll talk to them just like we'll talk to San Francisco and Washington,\\" Probst said. Probst said the USOC has begun the process of sounding out the three cities about stepping in, but declined to say what kind of response the committee has received so far. \\"We're going to share that feedback with our board first,\\" he said. The feedback from International Olympic members, meanwhile, has been loud and clear: \\"Surprisingly strong encouragement to bid,\\" Probst said. Many IOC members have told the AP they would welcome a Los Angeles bid. \\"They've heard the speculation, they've read the speculation and of course they assume it's going to happen,\\" Probst said. \\"They want to see a bid from the United States. We would love to host the games in 2024 and hope to have a strong bid.\\" Probst said numerous IOC members have spoken to him here about Boston's withdrawal. \\"Everybody thinks it's unfortunate,\\" he said. \\"When we chose Boston, we thought that it was going to be a strong bid. ... But at the end of the day we couldn't get the support of the local community. If you can't get the public to support a bid, you're not going to win. So we had to do what we thought was in the best interests of the USOC.\\" Probst poured cold water on the possibility of a joint bid between Los Angeles and San Francisco, though he didn't rule it out completely. \\"That would be complicated — not impossible, but complicated,\\" he said. Paris and Rome are among the declared candidates for 2024, along with Hamburg, Germany, and Budapest, Hungary. Toronto and Baku, Azerbaijan, are also weighing possible bids. The IOC will select the host city at its session Lima, Peru, in 2017. The U.S. hasn't hosted a Summer Games since Atlanta staged the 1996 Olympics. New York and Chicago failed in bids for the 2012 and 2016 Games, respectively. Asked whether the Boston debacle had damaged U.S. chances for 2024, Probst said: \\"I don't think so. I think that episode will be ancient history by the time that we get to Lima in 2017.\\" IOC President Thomas Bach this week accused Boston of failing to deliver on its \\"promises\\" to the USOC. Mayor Marty Walsh fired back that he wouldn't be \\"forced into spending taxpayers' money at risk.\\" \\"I have a lot of respect for Mayor Walsh,\\" Probst said. \\"I think he's a terrific guy.

(Associated Press) PARIS (AP) — An open letter signed by movie star Catherine Deneuve and dozens of other French women about men being unfairly targeted by sexual misconduct allegations has prompted a backlash in the French press and on social media. In the letter, published in Le Monde newspaper, Deneuve and about 100 actresses, writers, scholars and artists argued that the \\"legitimate protest against sexual violence\\" stemming from the Harvey Weinstein scandal has gone too far and threatens hard-won sexual freedoms. They said men should be free to hit on women and advocated against \\"puritanism.\\" On Wednesday, French women's rights activists denounced the letter as \\"a bit like the awkward work colleague or annoying uncle who doesn't understand what's happening.\\" The activists, including feminist Caroline De Haas, wrote on the Franceinfotv website that Deneuve and other signatories are making sexual violence appear \\"normal.\\" Marlene Schiappa, France's junior minister for women's rights, told France Culture radio: \\"There are in this open letter some things that are deeply offensive and false.\\" The letter signed by Deneuve said some women may see being rubbed against by a man in the metro as an expression of \\"sexual deprivation\\" or a \\"non-event.\\" Schiappa countered that \\"it's dangerous to say such things,\\" and insisted that such an act constituted sexual assault punishable with up to 3 years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros (90,100). Writer Abnousse Shalmani, one of those who signed the open letter, said she was surprised by the \\"extremely violent reactions\\" it prompted. \\"I consider myself to be a grown up. I am capable of receiving a sexual proposition and even more capable of saying no\\", she said on Europe 1 radio. Italian filmmaker and actress Asia Argento, one of the dozens of women who have alleged Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them, called the letter \\"deplorable\\" in a tweet. ||||| Veteran French actress Catherine Deneuve was among 100 women who signed an open letter last week, slamming what they termed “expeditious justice” spurred by the #MeToo movement and defending a man’s “freedom to importune.” The letter published in Le Monde has been the source of much debate in the past several days. Denueve herself is now responding. In her own open letter published by Libération Sunday night local time, the actress stands by signing the manifesto while also explaining her position and apologizing to “all victims of odious acts who may have felt offended” by the letter whose text she says does not claim that harassment is a good thing. Saying she felt a need to clarify her position, Deneuve writes, “Yes, I like freedom. I don’t like this characteristic of our times whereby everyone feels they have the right to judge, to arbitrate, to condemn. A time where simple denunciations on social media generate punishment, resignation and sometimes, and often, lynching by the media… I don’t excuse anything. I don’t decide the guilt of these men because I am not qualified to do so. And few are… No, I don’t like this pack mentality.” Saying she found the manifesto “vigorous” if not “perfectly right,” she declares, “Yes, I signed this petition, and yet it seems to me absolutely necessary today to underline my disagreement with the manner in which some of the signatories claim the right to permeate the media, distorting the spirit of the original text.” She goes on to cite, without naming her, a woman who appeared on television saying it is possible to have an orgasm during a rape. Such a declaration “is worse than spitting in the face of all those who have suffered this crime,” Deneuve writes. She adds, “Obviously nothing in the text claims that harassment is good, otherwise I would not have signed it.” The Oscar-nominated star of Indochine points out she has been an actress since age 17 and could say she has “witnessed situations that were more than indelicate, or that I know through other actors that filmmakers have abused their power in a cowardly manner.” But, “it is not for me to speak in the place of my sisters.” An essential reason Deneuve says she signed the text is “the danger of the purging of the arts. Are we going to burn Sade from La Pléiade? Designate Leonardo da Vinci as a pedophile artist and erase his paintings? Take Gaugin off museum walls? Destroy the drawings of Egon Schiele? Ban Phil Spector’s records? This climate of censorship leaves me speechless and worried about the future of our societies.” Deneuve concludes, “I have sometimes been reproached for not being a feminist,” and reminds that she was one of 343 women who signed the 1971 manifesto defending abortion rights that was written by Simone de Beauvoir. “Abortion was punishable by criminal prosecution and imprisonment at the time. That is why I want to say to conservatives, racists and traditionalists of all kinds who have found it strategic to support me, I am not fooled. They will have neither my gratitude nor my friendship, quite the contrary. I am a free woman and I will continue to be. I warmly salute all the victims of odious acts who may have felt offended by the letter published in Le Monde, it’s to them and them alone that I apologize.” ||||| French actor says she stands by letter that caused outcry but condemns other signatories for distorting the spirit of its message Catherine Deneuve has apologised to female victims of sexual assault who were shocked and hurt by the controversial letter she signed attacking the #MeToo campaign. The French actor said she stood by the statement that caused an international outcry when it was published last week, but distanced herself from a number of other female signatories. Le Monde newspaper, which ran the original letter, described Deneuve’s response to the row as “a form of mea culpa”. About 100 French women, including high-profile writers, artists and academics, put their names to the attack on a wave of Anglo-American “puritanism” following the Harvey Weinstein sex abuse scandal. They suggested the #MeToo campaign (#BalanceTonPorc – Squeal on Your Pig – in France) in which women denounced their alleged attackers had gone too far. They defended the right of men to “importune” in the name of “sexual freedom” and claimed men were being subjected to a witch-hunt. In her letter, published in Libération, Deneuve said she had signed the statement because she opposed the “media lynching” of men accused of inappropriate behaviour and found its message “vigorous” if not “entirely right”. “Yes, I signed that petition, however, it seems absolutely necessary today to underline my disagreement with the way certain signatories have individually assumed the right to expand upon it in the media, distorting the spirit of the text,” she wrote. She referred to former radio presenter Brigitte Lahaie, who during a heated debate on BFMTV said women were able to “orgasm during a rape”. Without mentioning Lahaie by name, Deneuve said this was “worse than spitting in the face of those who have suffered this crime”. “Not only do these words suggest to those who are used to using force or sexuality to destroy that it’s not so serious … but when one signs a manifesto that engages other people, one avoids dragging them into one’s own verbal incontinence. It’s unworthy. And obviously nothing in the text claims that harassment is good, otherwise I wouldn’t have signed it,” she wrote. Reminding those who questioned her feminist credentials that she was among 343 women, including feminist writer Simone de Beauvoir, to sign a 1971 declaration admitting they had an abortion when it was still illegal, Deneueve dismissed the “conservatives, racists and traditionalists of all kinds who have found it strategic to give me their support”. “I am not fooled,” she wrote. “They will not have my gratitude or my friendship. Quite the opposite. “I’m a free woman and I will remain one. I fraternally salute all women victims of odious acts who might have felt assaulted by the letter in Le Monde. It is to them, and them alone, that I apologise.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"French actress Catherine Deneuve has apologised to victims of sexual assault who may have felt offended by an open letter criticising the \\"#MeToo\\" movement.

A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways. - The Straits of Florida, Florida Straits, or Florida Strait is a strait located south-southeast of the North American mainland, generally accepted to be between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, and between the Florida Keys (U.S.) and Cuba. It is 150 km (93 mi) wide at the narrowest point between Key West and the Cuban shore, and has been sounded to a depth of 6,000 feet. The strait carries the Florida Current, the beginning of the Gulf Stream, from the Gulf of Mexico. - South Florida is a region of the U.S. state of Florida, comprising the southernmost part of the state. It is one of Florida's three most common \\"directional\\" regions, the others being Central Florida and North Florida. It includes the populous Miami metropolitan area, the Florida Keys, and other localities. South Florida is the only part of the continental United States with a tropical climate. - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world. - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. - A skyscraper is a tall, continuously habitable building having multiple floors.

UPDATED:. 07:37 EST, 1 January 2013. Angela Merkel has used her New Year's Eve speech to launch an open attack on the City of London as she attempts to win a third term as German Chancellor in 2013. In a move that will be grasped by British Eurosceptics, Mrs Merkel told Germany that she will repress Europe's biggest financial markets and fight to strengthen the EU's grip on banking. The Chancellor openly blames the financial collapse of the U.S. economy and light-touch regulation spearheaded by Britain for the Eurozone crisis. Stand-off: In a direct attack on the City of London, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe's largest markets needed to be controlled further to protect the Eurozone. Battle: Mrs Merkel is aiming to win a third term as Chancellor and she believes that Britain and the U.S. are to blame for Europe's financial markets. Throttling financial centres like London would allow her to work towards her dream of a European superstate with almost complete banking and economic union across the continent. Speech: David Cameron will make a pledge this month to wrestle more powers back from Brussels. 'The crisis is a long way from being beaten,' Mrs Merkel said on German television last night. 'Internationally, more needs to be done in order to exercise control. over the financial markets. The world has not sufficiently learnt the. lessons of the devastating 2008 financial crisis. Never again can we. allow irresponsibility like back then to happen. In a social market. economy, the state is the guardian of order — and that is something. people should be able to count on.' Germany will have a general election in September and Mrs Merkel wants to win a third term in the Bundeskanzleramt - the German chancellery. Her relationship with David Cameron is fragile and the Prime Minister is preparing a keynote speech this month where he will demand that more powers are transferred from Brussels back to London. Financial services, based mainly in the City, make up 10 per cent of the UK economy and Mr Cameron will fight tooth and nail to protect it. But German has already signed up to a new banking transaction tax being touted by France, however, the UK can opt out. Even though Merkel's conservative party holds a commanding 10-point lead in opinion polls over the Social Democrats (SPD), the centre-left opposition SPD and their Greens allies have a chance of taking power because Merkel's coalition allies, the Free Democrats (FDP) have slumped badly and may not win seats. The U.S. ambassador to NATO has called on the UK and Europe to up its defence spending as it cannot rely on America any longer. Ivo Daalder says cash saved after 2014 when all NATO troops leave Afghanistan must be pumped back into military budgets. He said that the U.S. will be focussing its money elsewhere - particularly in Asia and China. 'If we don't start soon in investing in those capabilities then the gap between the US and the rest is going to grow. If we have problems, they will be even worse,' he said. The MoD in Britain is privately urging David Cameron to withdraw from Afghanistan early to save more money. But America says NATO members should put the cash into arms. But political analysts believe Merkel still has the most options to form a government after the vote. She could lead a right-left grand coalition with the SPD as she did from 2005 to 2009 or a coalition with the pro-environment Greens party. In what is viewed as a speech that will kick-start the election race, Merkel urged Germans to be more patient even though the euro zone crisis has already dragged on for three years. She drew a line linking German prosperity to a prosperous European Union. 'For our prosperity and our solidarity we need to strike the right balance,' Merkel said. 'The European sovereign debt crisis shows how important this balance is. 'The reforms that we've introduced are beginning to have an impact,' she said. 'Nevertheless we need to have further continued patience. The crisis is far from over.' But in face of slowing economic growth, Merkel also warned that conditions could be more difficult in 2013 than in 2012. 'I know that many people are naturally concerned going into the new year,' she said. 'And the economic environment will not in fact be easier but rather more difficult next year. But we shouldn't let that get us down; rather it should spur us on.'","output":"German Chancellor Angela Merkel delivered a New Year's Eve speech in 2013, launching an open attack on the City of London. In an attempt to win her third term as Chancellor, Merkel claimed that she would restrain Europe's biggest financial markets and fight to strengthen the European Union's control on banking. She blamed the financial collapse of the U.S. economy and the light-touch regulation led by Britain for the Eurozone crisis. Merkel aimed to gain control over the financial markets to work towards a united European banking and economic system. The statement failed to discourage British authorities, with David Cameron pledging to regain more powers from Brussels. Despite her open criticism of the UK's financial market, Merkel held a strong lead in opinion polls, providing her with a good chance of winning the general election held in September. In her speech, she urged Germans to be patient as the crisis continued but highlighted the first signs of positive impact from the reforms introduced. Merkel's relationship with the UK and David Cameron remained shaky, as the Prime Minister prepared a crucial speech demanding more powers to be transferred from Brussels back to London. It is worth noting that financial services, mainly in the City, account for 10% of the UK economy, and Cameron was determined to protect it. In the face of an economic slowdown, Merkel warned that conditions could worsen in 2013. Nevertheless, she urged people not to be discouraged and to find motivation in overcoming the challenges."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"When was the Win 7 logo replaced?\\" is in \\"Three milestone releases of Windows 8 leaked to the general public.

Choose from: [1]. negative. [2]. positive.","output":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mix of both positive and negative emotions. On one hand, there is a positive aspect to the tweet, which is the expression of gratitude towards the person's mom. The mom's action of \\"saving the person's ass\\" demonstrates support, and the fact that the individual \\"just made it\\" to work on time is a positive outcome. Thus, these aspects reflect a positive sentiment. On the other hand, the tweet also carries a negative sentiment. The individual mentions feeling \\"crappy,\\" which is undoubtedly a negative emotion. Additionally, almost being late for work implies that the person did not have their ideal start to the day, hence contributing to the negative sentiment. In conclusion, this tweet contains elements of both positive and negative sentiments. Therefore, neither option [1] (negative) nor option [2] (positive) alone can accurately describe the sentiment of this tweet.

Released in 2004 and starring Jim Carrey as Joel Barish and Kate Winslet as Clementine Kruczynski, this romantic science fiction film expertly blends drama with elements of surrealism to create a captivating visual masterpiece. The film begins with the seemingly chance meeting of Joel and Clementine on a train. Their chemistry is electric, resonating with those ephemeral and almost intangible feelings that arise when two people unexpectedly click. As the story progresses, however, we uncover that their meeting was not by chance at all; it was actually a reunion following a failed romantic relationship between the two protagonists. This post-breakup world is clouded by memories, regret and the desire to erase the painful past. The innovative premise for the film centers around a medical technique developed by Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (played by Tom Wilkinson) and his company Lacuna Inc. They specialize in erasing select memories from people's minds, allowing them to forget traumatic events or failed relationships. Joel, desperate to mend his broken heart by erasing his memories of Clementine, undergoes the procedure. However, during the process, he begins to relive their relationship in reverse. The use of vivid and fragmented imagery combined with an impactful non-linear narrative successfully immerses the viewer in both the workings of the human mind and the emotions associated with love and loss. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet's stellar performances shine, allowing audiences to relate to their characters' flaws and aspirations. Winslet's portrayal of Clementine is a kaleidoscope of emotions, revealing the eccentric and vulnerable sides of her character with equal excellence. Carrey's performance as Joel offers a surprisingly grounded and raw performance that departs from his usual comedic roles. Adding to the brilliance of the film is the hauntingly beautiful and emotive soundtrack composed by Jon Brion. Each note complements the movie's atmosphere and enhances the emotional impact of each scene. The cinematography, helmed by Ellen Kuras, further adds depth to the visual storytelling, accompanied by the use of various practical effects and seamless transitions between memories. The supporting cast, including performances by Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst, and Mark Ruffalo, all contribute to the intricate web of plotlines that extend beyond the central love story. As the subplots unfold, they expose the human element in each character, making Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind a film about love, memories, and the human experience as a whole. In conclusion, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a visually stunning and thought-provoking film that combines impeccable acting, an emotionally engaging storyline, and unparalleled artistic direction. The exploration of human memory as both a source of pain and a vital part of personal identity leaves viewers with a lingering reminder of the importance of cherishing the moments and people that shape our lives. This cinematic gem is an undeniable must-see for anyone seeking a profound film experience that will resonate with them on both emotional and intellectual levels."},{"instruction":"Given an English language product review, determine if it is a Good Review or a Bad Review.

Step 1: Understanding the TATA box in eukaryotes The TATA box is a DNA sequence found in the promoter region of many eukaryotic genes. It serves as a binding site for the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and other transcription factors, which assemble to form the pre-initiation complex. This complex plays a crucial role in the initiation of transcription, the process by which genetic information from DNA is copied into RNA. Step 2: Identifying a similar structure in prokaryotes In prokaryotes, the functionally equivalent structure to the TATA box is the Pribnow box or the -10 sequence. The Pribnow box is a conserved DNA sequence located approximately 10 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site in the promoter region of prokaryotic genes. This sequence is typically found in bacteria and serves as a recognition site for the RNA polymerase sigma factor during transcription initiation. The Pribnow box plays a similar role as the TATA box in eukaryotes, with both elements acting as binding sites for proteins that facilitate transcription initiation. In summary, the Pribnow box, or the -10 sequence, is the structure in prokaryotes that is similar to the TATA box in eukaryotes. Both these structures serve as binding sites for proteins that function in the initiation of transcription."},{"instruction":"Question: What happened between Ron and Veronica?

He works alongside his friends on the news team: fashion-oriented lead field reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sportscaster Champion \\"Champ\\" Kind (David Koechner), and a \\"legally retarded\\" chief meteorologist Brick Tamland (Steve Carell). The team is notified by their boss, Ed Harken (Fred Willard), that their station has maintained its long-held status as the highest-rated news program in San Diego, leading them to throw a wild party. Ron sees an attractive blond woman and immediately tries to hit on her. After an awkward, failed pick-up attempt, the woman leaves.The next day, Ed informs the team that he has been forced by the network to hire Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), a female news reporter from Asheville, North Carolina and the same woman Ron had tried to pick up the night before. The news team attempts to seduce Veronica using various inept, arrogant and sexist methods, all of which backfire. Ron ends up asking her out under the guise of helping out a new co-worker, which she accepts. During their date, Ron woos Veronica by playing jazz flute in his friend Tino's (Fred Armisen) club. Veronica goes against her policy of not dating co-workers and sleeps with Ron. The next day, despite agreeing with Veronica to keep the relationship discreet, Ron tells the entire news room that he and Veronica are in a sexual relationship (and later announces it on the air).The next day when Ron is on his way to the station, he throws a burrito out his car window, accidentally hitting a motorcyclist (Jack Black) in the head, causing him to crash. In a fit of rage, the biker retaliates by punting Ron's dog, Baxter, off a bridge. A distressed and incoherent Ron calls Brian from a pay phone and tells him what happened. Since Ron is now late, Brian frantically tells him to come to the station because Veronica is about to take his place. Despite Ron's efforts to arrive on time,... Answer:","output":"What happened between Ron and Veronica is that they had a tumultuous and multifaceted relationship throughout the course of the film \\"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.\\" When Ron initially tried to pick up Veronica at a party, his attempt failed, and it was later revealed that she was the new female news reporter hired by the network to join their news team. Veronica's addition to the team was met with resistance, as the male team members attempted to seduce her in various inappropriate ways, all of which were unsuccessful. Despite the rocky start, Ron and Veronica ended up going on a date, where Ron impressed her with his jazz flute-playing skills. The date led to them sleeping together, breaking Veronica's rule of not dating co-workers. In a lapse of judgment, Ron failed to keep their relationship discreet, resulting in tensions escalating at work. After Ron accidentally hit a motorcyclist with a burrito and his dog, Baxter, was thrown off a bridge by the biker in retaliation, Ron was late to the news broadcast. This enabled Veronica to step in and anchor the news, a role she had not been permitted to do previously. This turn of events strained the relationship between Ron and Veronica even further, as she took advantage of her newfound opportunity to become a co-anchor, challenging the male-dominated news team's dynamic. As Veronica's success grew, so did the rivalry between her and Ron. They competed both professionally and personally in a series of challenges, pranks, and conflicts. Their interactions became increasingly adversarial as the film progressed, culminating in Ron being fired from the news team due to unraveling on air, while Veronica's career took off. However, in the climax of the movie, they reconciled and worked together to save the day during a disastrous event at the San Diego Zoo. Ultimately, the relationship between Ron and Veronica began with conflict and misunderstandings but evolved into a mutual respect and partnership at work. Though the romantic aspect of their relationship experienced ups and downs throughout the film, they ultimately were able to overcome their differences and enhance the success of the news team."},{"instruction":"Because Ash's brother misplaced Ash's computer, Ash complained to their mother.

Plans were formed for building a great network of railways, partly for the purpose of developing the natural resources of the country, and partly for the purpose of increasing its power for defense and attack. The existence of serfdom was tackled boldly, taking advantage of a petition presented by the Polish landed proprietors of the Lithuanian provinces and, hoping that their relations with the serfs might be regulated in a more satisfactory way (meaning in a way more satisfactory for the proprietors), he authorized the formation of committees \\"for ameliorating the condition of the peasants,\\" and laid down the principles on which the amelioration was to be effected. This step had been followed by one even more significant. Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to send a circular to the provincial governors of European Russia (serfdom was rare in other parts), containing a copy of the instructions forwarded to the Governor-General of Lithuania, praising the supposed generous, patriotic intentions of the Lithuanian landed proprietors, and suggesting that perhaps the landed proprietors of other provinces might express a similar desire. The hint was taken: in all provinces where serfdom existed, emancipation committees were formed. The emancipation was not merely a humanitarian question capable of being solved instantaneously by imperial ukase. It contained very complicated problems, deeply affecting the economic, social and political future of the nation. Alexander had to choose between the different measures recommended to him and decide if the serfs would become agricultural laborers dependent economically and administratively on the landlords or if the serfs would be transformed into a class of independent communal proprietors. The emperor gave his support to the latter project, and the Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in Europe to shake off serfdom. The architects of the emancipation manifesto were Alexander's brother Konstantin, Yakov Rostovtsev, and Nikolay Milyutin. On 3 March 1861, 6 years after his accession, the emancipation law was signed and published.

We have this equation: -2*r + 46*r + 19 = -25 First, let's combine the r's (just like when we add or subtract same objects, like apples). So, -2*r and 46*r are both r's, we can add them: -2*r + 46*r = 44*r (Because -2 + 46 equals 44) Now our equation looks like this: 44*r + 19 = -25 Next, we need to remove that +19. To do that, we'll do the opposite, which is -19 (subtract 19). But, whatever we do to one side, we need to do the same to the other side to make it fair. So: 44*r + 19 - 19 = -25 - 19 Since 19 - 19 is zero, we have: 44*r = -44 (Because -25 - 19 equals -44) Now, we have just one more step, buddy! We need to find what \\"r\\" is. To do that, since 44 is multiplied by \\"r\\", we'll do the opposite. So, we'll divide by 44: 44*r / 44 = -44 / 44 The number 44 is divided by itself turns into 1: 1*r = -1 (Because -44 divided by 44 equals -1) So, r = -1 There you have it!

Reasoning: The answer is \\"it is not possible to tell\\" because the perception of an object's color is influenced by multiple factors, including the object's surroundings, ambient lighting, and the medium it is in. When an object is submerged in water, the water absorbs and scatters different wavelengths of light, which can alter the appearance of the object's color. As the depth of the water increases, the amount of available light decreases and the color spectrum gradually shifts towards the blue and green wavelengths. This effect is further compounded by the presence of various lighting conditions, as the angle and intensity of light can also influence the perceived color.

She won eight NCAA championships (a NCAA women's record when she retired) and the third most all time. Summitt won a silver medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal as a member of the United States women's national basketball team. Summitt was born Patricia Sue Head on June 14, 1952 in Clarksville, Tennessee, the daughter of Richard and Hazel Albright Head. In her early years, she was known as Trish. She had four siblings: older brothers Tommy, Charles, and Kenneth, and a younger sister, Linda. She married Ross Barnes Summitt II in 1980 from whom she filed for divorce in 2007. They have one son, Ross Tyler Summitt, born in 1990.

This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring towns used different approaches to agriculture. Big town used pesticides and fertilizers, while Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which town had less growth of water plants because of fertilizer? Answer:","output":"Small town had less growth of water plants because of fertilizer. To provide a comprehensive understanding in relation to the background article and the situation at hand, it is essential to delve into the different approaches to agriculture undertaken by the two towns, as well as the environmental impact and potential consequences of each method. Big town opted for conventional agricultural practices, which involve the heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. These chemicals help to boost crop yields and protect crops from pests, but they can also have significant negative impacts on the environment. When rainwater falls on these farmlands, it can pick up these chemicals and cause them to enter nearby rivers and lakes as runoff. The dissolved fertilizer, which often contains high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, can promote excessive growth of water plants and algae (eutrophication). This overgrowth can then lead to oxygen depletion in the water bodies, creating dead zones where aquatic life is unable to survive. Moreover, chemicals infiltrating into groundwater can eventually pollute wells, putting people who rely on this water source at risk of health issues. In contrast, Small town implemented permaculture principles and organic farming methods, which promote sustainable and environmentally friendly practices. Permaculture involves the design of agricultural ecosystems that are intended to be self-sustaining, resilient, and in harmony with the natural environment. Organic farming, on the other hand, eschews the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides in favor of natural alternatives, such as compost, manure, and biological pest control. By avoiding or limiting the use of chemical fertilizers, Small town reduces the likelihood of harmful nutrient runoff entering local water bodies. Consequently, the risks of excessive plant growth, dead zones, and water well contamination are considerably lower. Given these contrasting approaches, it is evident that Small town, due to its practices of permaculture and organic farming, experienced less growth of water plants as a result of fertilizer usage. By choosing an agricultural system that prioritizes sustainability and environmental health, Small town has managed to mitigate many of the negative consequences associated with conventional chemical-intensive farming practices, leading to healthier water bodies and a reduced risk of groundwater pollution."},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - Interest is payment from a borrower or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum (\\"i.e.\\" the amount borrowed).

Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to consume, alter, share, redefine, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell, exchange, transfer, give away or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things, as well as to perhaps abandon it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it (as a durable, mean or factor, or whatever), or at the very least exclusively keep it. - The verb license or grant license means to give permission. The noun licence (British, Indian, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Irish, or South African English) or license (American English) refers to that permission as well as to the document recording that permission. - In the law of evidence, a presumption of a particular fact can be made without the aid of proof in some situations. The types of presumption include a rebuttable discretionary presumption, a rebuttable mandatory presumption, and an irrebuttable or conclusive presumption. The invocation of a presumption shifts the burden of proof from one party to the opposing party in a court trial. Presumptions are sometimes categorized into two types: presumptions without basic facts, and presumptions with basic facts. In the United States, mandatory presumptions are impermissible in criminal cases, but permissible presumptions are allowed. - A deed (anciently \\"an evidence\\") is any legal instrument in writing which passes, affirms or confirms an interest, right, or property and that is signed, attested, delivered, and in some jurisdictions, sealed. It is commonly associated with transferring title to property. The deed has a greater presumption of validity and is less rebuttable than an instrument signed by the party to the deed. A deed can be unilateral or bilateral. Deeds include conveyances, commissions, licenses, patents, diplomas, and conditionally powers of attorney if executed as deeds. The deed is the modern descendant of the medieval charter, and delivery is thought to symbolically replace the ancient ceremony of livery of seisin. - A charter is the grant of authority or rights, stating that the granter formally recognizes the prerogative of the recipient to exercise the rights specified. It is implicit that the granter retains superiority (or sovereignty), and that the recipient admits a limited (or inferior) status within the relationship, and it is within that sense that charters were historically granted, and that sense is retained in modern usage of the term. - Legal instrument is a legal term of art that is used for any formally executed written document that can be formally attributed to its author, records and formally expresses a legally enforceable act, process, or contractual duty, obligation, or right, and therefore evidences that act, process, or agreement. Examples include a certificate, deed, bond, contract, will, legislative act, notarial act, court writ or process, or any law passed by a competent legislative body in municipal (domestic) or international law. Many legal instruments were written \\"under seal\\" by affixing a wax or paper seal to the document in evidence of its legal execution and authenticity (which often removes the need for consideration in contract law); however, today many jurisdictions have done away with the requirement of documents being under seal in order to give them legal effect.

Answer:","output":"Collateral assurance has the relation 'instance of' with legal instruments."},{"instruction":"Write highlights for this article: It wasn't so long ago that biofuels were being heralded as the savior of the planet and a thoroughly green solution to our climate woes. But fair winds have been replaced by persistent storms of criticism. But is it justified? Principal Voices has spoken to three people -- an economist, a scientist and an environmental campaigner -- at the heart of the biofuels debate. Here, they have their say on biofuels. Have yours at bottom of the page. The British countryside is transformed in the spring by swathes of rapeseed. The Economist. Keith Wiebe is the service chief in the Economic and Social Development Department at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). He is currently working on the FAO Annual Report into the state of food and agriculture which this year is focusing on biofuels. The report will be published in September 2008. Biofuels are obviously playing a role in the current food situation. It is a new source of demand that has risen dramatically over the past couple of years. This has been a significant factor in the increase in commodities prices recently. What's unique about the past year or two and particularly the past few months is the convergence of a whole number of factors on both the supply side and the demand side. The background is that you've had the gradually increasing income and demand for more, and different types of food in emerging economies. You've had a gradual decline in international stocks of food, you've got higher oil prices which means the costs of production are going up. There have been some been some production setbacks in a couple of key export countries such as Australia and also a rapid increase in demand for maize and vegetable oils for biodiesel and ethanol production. All these factors interact and lead to policy responses from countries to limit exports of commodities to protect their domestic consumers. It's impossible to disentangle a specific portion or to attribute a particular portion to the price increases. One thing to keep in mind is that biofuels play a role in the current high prices but they are certainly not the only factor. The other thing is that they have adverse short term impact on food prices. They have an adverse impact on poor consumers particularly in developing countries. But there is an opportunity over the longer term at least for small farmers who do have access to resources to adjust their production patterns. And high prices give them an incentive to do exactly that. Small farmers in developing countries see these price incentives and they see they would like to respond. But through a combination of export bans in some countries and poor infrastructure, they are limited in their ability to respond. I think it is important to distinguish between different types of biofuels. They have very different characteristics. Brazilian sugar cane is the classic example of a type of biofuel that is now performing efficiently and competitively. They are alone among all the major biofuel foodstocks in being competitive at market prices. Whereas in the U.S., maize continues to cost more to produce it than it does to be competitive with the fossil fuel counterpart. There is a lot of potential in second generation cellulosic technologies but they are not yet commercially viable but that point is coming closer every day. There is so much effort which has gone into this recently and if there is a silver lining to the whole situation it is that people are looking everywhere for alternatives. Two years ago the general perspective on biofuels was that they were a very bright prospect and to say anything negative about them was somehow a suspect analysis. This situation has been completely reversed. What we would like to continue to emphasize is that there are many different types of biofuels, some are more promising than others. Certainly there are things that need to be reevaluated and looked at very carefully. There is also the potential if policies can be improved and investment can be made in agriculture. Many of the world's poor depend on agriculture for their livelihood. We don't want to throw out an opportunity for them. The Scientist. Dr Richard Pike is the chief executive of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Prior to taking up the role in 2006 he spent 20 years working in the oil industry. He recently calculated that a one-way transatlantic flight would require one year's biofuels yield from an area the size of 30 football pitches. Biofuels will clearly have an application at a local level. I think there is a general view that at a very local level -- and I'm talking of small townships that are surrounded by land that could cultivate biofuels -- that it is probably sustainable. Whether it can be applied on a large scale in a sustainable way will vary tremendously from country to country. But one has to be very careful about projecting into the future. For instance in the UK there is a lot of talk about biofuels, but one of the big issues is the very low efficiency in converting sunlight into the oil or ethanol that you would use to fill up your tank. Typically the efficiency is considerably less than half a percent. That raises the whole issue of land use. If, on the one hand, you've got biofuels which represent only a half a percent conversion of sunlight, and let's say you've got photovoltaic cells and concentrated solar power systems, the efficiency of solar in terms of pure conversion is 50-100 times greater. In the UK, for every one percent of diesel and petrol you want to replace with biofuel you need, in big round numbers, about one percent of the land area of the UK. That's a very stunning statistic. And it means that if you're looking at notions of self-sufficiency then it's completely out of the window. If the UK wanted to be more biofuel orientated it would have to import it. Currently the European Union directive is to have 5.75 percent biofuels by 2010. If the UK was to provide that for itself, five percent of the land would have to be utilized -- which is an extraordinary number. Typically biofuel yields are of the order of three to four tons per hectare. That excludes things like the carbon footprint of fertilizers, harvesting and distribution. The figures you see in the press tend to be focused on the yield from the ground rather than thinking of the bigger picture. There is a real need to look at the big picture and there's a risk that the focus on biofuels and the idea that it could offer quite a significant contribution is distracting from some of the more important things that need to be looked at. There are lots of small initiatives, either at the user end -- e.g. turning off stand-by switches, drinking tap water -- or the supply end -- e.g. wind energy, tidal energy. What people are forgetting is that if you look at the energy balance of the world, 80 percent of the world's energy is supplied by fossil fuels. That is likely to remain unchanged for a long time. Fossil fuels are not going to run out that quickly. Reserves figures that you see quoted are very conservative. The other thing about biofuels is what I call the problem of unintended consequences. Biofuels are clearly going down a route that is bringing it into conflict with food crops and biodiversity. People have talked about a much more efficient biofuel process involving algae. Algae would have significantly high yields. But then again, I don't think enough people have gone through what might happen if that were pursued. You have to ask how it would affect marine life. The Environmental Campaigner. Deepak Rughani is co-director of Biofuelwatch, a campaign group backing the expanding call for a moratorium on agrofuels* in the European Union. Biofuelwatch is currently engaged in a new challenge; to help prevent the first biofuel-fired power station to be built in the UK. If energy company Blue-ng is successful a precedent will have been set and according to UK newspaper, The Independent another 43 power stations could follow. On June 4th, Newham Councilors in east London will meet to make their recommendation on the proposed plant. Coincidently the meeting marks the second day of the UN's High-Level Conference on World Food Security, Climate Change and Bioenergy in Rome. More than 770 organizations and prominent individuals worldwide have signed a Civil Society statement on the World Food Emergency which calls for a halt to all development of land for agrofuels for cars, planes and for energy production in power stations. So far, only Germany has invested heavily in vegetable oil CHP plants -- 1,800 of them. The vast majority burn palm oil because European vegetable oil is too expensive. According to experts, the impact on the climate has been disastrous. Peat expert Professor Siegert of Munich University has warned: \\"We were able to prove that the making of these plantations and the burning of the rainforests and peat areas emits many thousands of times as much CO2 as we then are able to prevent by using palm oil. And that is a disastrous balance for the climate.\\" Unfortunately, switching to rapeseed oil, even if it was affordable, would not necessarily help matters: As confirmed by a UN report, Europe's use of rapeseed oil for bioenergy is one of the main reasons for rising palm oil prices linked to shortages in the food and cosmetics markets. Inevitably rising prices make deforestation and peat drainage in South East Asia much more profitable. There are other serious concerns about the east London proposal: Vegetable oil burning leads to emissions of NOx and particulates -- PM 10 and PM 2.5 -- known to have an adverse effect on the respiratory and cardiovascular system. Areas close to the proposed site are currently being monitored as Air Quality Management areas and many residents are very concerned about the plans. It seems that in the name of decentralized energy generation -- which is likely to be much more efficient than centralized energy generation -- government and companies are willing to both disregard the welfare of local people and at the very time when we need to be dramatically reducing our demand for vegetable oil, offer a new market for agrofuels. By backing false-solutions we stall investment from the true renewable energies such as wind, solar, wave and geothermal and ignore our responsibility to prevent crossing key climate tipping points, beyond which our current civilization and even much of life on earth could not sustain itself. * Agrofuels are biofuels produced from crops or trees grown in large-scale monocultures, or agricultural and forest 'waste' which should be returned to the natural system. Highlights:","output":"1. Biofuels have been under scrutiny recently due to the significant rise in demand and consequential increase in commodities prices. These rising costs create difficulty for consumers, especially the poor in developing countries. However, for farmers with access to the necessary resources, it provides an opportunity to adjust their production patterns, especially with the price incentives in place. 2. All biofuels are not the same, it's important to differentiate between them. Biofuels like Brazilian sugarcane are performing efficiently and can compete at market prices, unlike others like maize in the U.S. 3. While second generation cellulosic technologies have potential, they are not yet commercially viable, but development efforts are bringing them closer to viability every day. Despite the negative current perspectives, it's important to keep in mind that some biofuels are more promising than others. 4. The efficiency of turning sunlight into biofuels is relatively low, which raises issues about land use. The efficiency of photovoltaic cells and concentrated solar power systems is many times greater than that of biofuels, which makes biofuels' large-scale production less sustainable. 5. The focus on biofuels distracts from the importance of other initiatives like energy conservation measures and the development and use of alternative energy such as wind and tidal energy. Biofuels also have unintended consequences like conflict with food crop production and biodiversity. 6. Concerns are being raised over biofuel-fired power stations and their potential impact on the climate and land. More than 770 organizations worldwide are calling for a halt on land development for agrofuels to prevent potential environmental disasters. 7. There are negative consequences to the use of specific biofuels (palm oil and rapeseed oil), like deforestation due to increased profitability and an increase in carbon emissions. The use of vegetable oil also causes harmful emissions that can negatively affect the respiratory and cardiovascular systems of people living near production areas. 8. In pushing for decentralized energy generation, the welfare of local people and the environment is often overlooked. Experts have cautioned that the backing of false solutions could delay investment in genuine renewable energies such as wind, solar, wave, and geothermal."},{"instruction":"Q:Pick one category for the following text.

Reasoning: - Last all night: This option is not relevant to finding honey as it seems to refer to something lasting for a long time. - Beehive: This is the natural source of honey, as it is where bees store the honey they produce. By going directly to a beehive, you can get honey straight from the source. - Farmer's market: While this option may offer locally sourced honey, it is not directly from the source (the beehive). Honey found at a farmer's market would already have likely been extracted, filtered, and packaged. - Jar: This option refers to a container for storing honey once it has been processed and packaged, not the direct source of honey. - Honeyful: This option seems ambiguous and does not provide clear information about where to find honey. Given these options, going directly to a beehive would be your best choice for finding honey right from the source.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more children become teenagers happens, how will it affect less adults have children. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've presented suggests that if more children become teenagers, there will be fewer adults having children. It is essential to analyze each stage of the human life process to understand the potential effects of this perturbation on the overall process. First, if more children become teenagers, we can assume that it could be due to factors such as improved healthcare, better nutrition, and a safer environment. These factors may contribute to a higher survival rate among children, leading to a larger teenage population than before. Now, let's consider the potential impact on adults having children. If fewer adults have children, it could result from several factors; some of which might be interconnected with the increased number of teenagers: 1. Societal Shifts: As societies evolve, there might be a shift in social values and priorities. People may choose to invest more time in their personal and professional development, delaying or reducing the number of children they have. 2. Economic Factors: Increased cost of living, housing, and education may lead adults to postpone or limit the number of children they have, focusing more on providing a good life for a smaller family. 3. Population Control Measures: As the world's population continues to grow, governments might implement policies to reduce population growth, limiting access to resources, or offering incentives for adults to have fewer children. 4. Environmental Concerns: People may choose to have fewer children due to concerns about the strain on Earth's resources and the impact of overpopulation on climate change. Indirectly, the perturbation could have long-term effects on the overall process of human life. As fewer adults have children, the following generations might see a smaller population, which would then affect the number of babies born, altering the dynamics of future population growth. In conclusion, the perturbation of more children becoming teenagers, resulting in fewer adults having children, does have a potential effect (direct or indirect) on the human life process. The specific impacts would depend on various factors, such as societal values, economic considerations, population control measures, and environmental concerns which could contribute to the eventual outcomes of this perturbation."},{"instruction":"Q: Based on the information present in the given passage, you need to write a correct answer to the given question.

In which case melanocytes would produce less melanin, case D or case L? John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world. He noticed that people have different skin colors. To learn more about the science behind skin colors he categorized the skin colors into two broad groups, case D and case L. Case D is represented by darker skin and case L is represented by lighter skin. Hint: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D .

The Babylonians and Chinese were using wind power to pump water for irrigating crops 4,000 years ago, and sailing boats were around long before that. Wind power was used in the Middle Ages, in Europe, to grind corn, which is where the term \\"windmill\\" comes from. We can use the energy in the wind by building a tall tower, with a large propeller on the top. The wind blows the propellor round, which turns a generator to produce electricity. We tend to build many of these towers together, to make a \\"wind farm\\" and produce more electricity. The more towers, the more wind, and the larger the propellors, the more electricity we can make. It's only worth building wind farms in places that have strong, steady winds, although boats and caravans increasingly have small wind generators to help keep their batteries charged. The best places for wind farms are in coastal areas, at the tops of rounded hills, open plains and gaps in mountains - places where the wind is strong and reliable. Some are offshore. To be worthwhile, you need an average wind speed of around 25 km/h. Most wind farms in the UK are in Cornwall or Wales. Isolated places such as farms may have their own wind generators. In California, several \\"wind farms\\" supply electricity to homes around Los Angeles. The propellors are large, to obtain energy from the largest possible volume of air. The blades can be angled to cope with varying wind speeds. Some designs use vertical turbines , which don't need to be turned to face the wind. The towers are tall, to get the propellors as high as possible, up to where the wind is stronger. This means that the land beneath can still be used for farming.

He reads on lunch breaks. He even reads between meetings as he walks across Microsoft’s Seattle campus, where he works as a program manager. Before he tried it, he wondered whether reading in snippets might be dissatisfying. But to his surprise, he found he could quickly re-immerse himself in the book he was reading. “I want reading to be part of my life,” said Mr. Vestal, age 35. “If I waited for the kind of time I used to have—sitting down for five hours—I wouldn’t read at all.” Ever since the first hand-held e-readers were introduced in the 1990s, the digital-reading revolution has turned the publishing world upside down. But contrary to early predictions, it’s not the e-reader that will be driving future book sales, but the phone. “The future of digital reading is on the phone,” said Judith Curr, publisher of the Simon & Schuster imprint Atria Books. “It’s going to be on the phone and it’s going to be on paper.” For now, tablets like the iPad and Kindle Fire remain the most popular platform to read digital books. According to Nielsen, the percentage of e-book buyers who read primarily on tablets was 41% in the first quarter of 2015, compared with 30% in 2012. But what has captured publishers’ attention is the increase in the number of people reading their phones. In a Nielsen survey of 2,000 people this past December, about 54% of e-book buyers said they used smartphones to read their books at least some of the time. That’s up from 24% in 2012, according to a separate study commissioned by Nielsen. The number of people who read primarily on phones has risen to 14% in the first quarter of 2015 from 9% in 2012. Meanwhile, those reading mainly on e-readers, such as Kindles and Nooks, dropped over the same period to 32% from 50%. Even tablet reading has declined recently to 41% in the first quarter this year from 44% in 2014. The rise of phone reading is pushing publishers to rethink the way books are designed, marketed and sold with smaller screens in mind. It’s also prompting concern about whether deep, concentrated thinking is possible amid the ringing, buzzing and alerts that come with phones. One reason people are reading on phones is convenience. If you’re standing in line at the deli, waiting at the DMV or riding home on the train, you may not have a print book or an e-reader or tablet. But chances are, you are carrying a smartphone. Some 64% of American adults now own a smartphone, up from 35% in the spring of 2011, according to the Pew Research Center. Forrester Research, a research and advisory firm, projects that smartphone subscribers will number 80.8% of the U.S. population by 2019. “The best device to read on is the one you have with you,” said Willem Van Lancker, co-founder and chief product officer of the subscription-book service Oyster. “It requires no planning. My bookshelf at home isn’t any good to me when I’m at the park.” Another reason people are turning to phones is the size and clarity of new smartphone models, which make reading much easier. The average smartphone screen in 2014 was 5.1 inches—compared with a 3.9-inch average in 2011, according to eMarketer. Since the release of the bigger, sharper iPhone 6 and 6 Plus last September, Apple has seen an increase in the number of people downloading books onto iPhones through its iBooks app. Some 45% of iBooks purchases are now downloaded onto iPhones, an Apple spokeswoman said. Before that, only 28% were downloaded onto phones, with most of the remainder downloaded onto iPads and a small percentage onto computers. Amazon has also noted the development. Among all new customers using Kindles or the Kindle app, phone readers are by far the fastest-growing segment, an Amazon spokeswoman said, declining to disclose figures. Among those who use the Kindle app, more people now read books on the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus than on any other Apple device, even the popular iPad Mini, she said. To engage readers, publishers are now experimenting with ways to make the mobile-reading experience better. They are designing book jackets with smartphone screens in mind. (Handwritten scripts or small fonts may not be legible.) They are customizing their marketing materials—email blasts, Facebook posts and websites—to be read on phones. And some are trying to catch people on the go, offering free access to e-books in airports, hotels and trains. “How do I serve something up to somebody who perhaps wasn’t thinking about a book two minutes ago?” said Liz Perl, the chief marketing officer at Simon & Schuster, which has teamed up with Foli, a mobile-distribution platform, to offer free e-books at specific GPS coordinates. “The read-anywhere option is amazing. It’s an obligation for us as publishers to find those people.” Through the Foli mobile app, Simon & Schuster in May offered David McCullough’s “The Wright Brothers” free at more than 50 U.S. airports. In June, it served up “Yoga for Life” by Colleen Saidman Yee at the Solstice in Times Square yoga festival in New York. Now the publisher offers free e-books at hotels and airport lounges in New York, California, Missouri, Florida, Texas and Hawaii. Users can read as much of each book as they like free, as long as they stay within the prescribed geographical area. Earlier this year, Penguin Random House introduced free excerpts of e-books on Amtrak’s Acela Express trains, including, naturally, Paula Hawkins’s “The Girl on the Train.” Most people who read on their phones toggle back and forth between devices, using whichever is closest at hand when opportunity strikes, according to a survey this year by the book-recommendation site Goodreads. Nearly two-thirds of respondents who read on their phones said they did so because they didn’t have their e-reader or tablet with them. Amazon, Google, Apple and Barnes & Noble all offer smartphone apps for reading books. They automatically sync all devices linked to the same account, so a reader can open an e-book on her phone and pick up exactly where she left off the night before on her e-reader or tablet. Amazon and Google recently introduced custom e-book fonts, both designed to be more legible on smartphone screens. Fully 55% of all Oyster’s activity is now happening on phones, and the company in June introduced a new display option called Lumin that reduces the amount of blue light emitted from smartphone and tablet screens to make reading easier on the eyes at night (its users’ peak reading time). “I think people are reading constantly now, and it’s because of phones,” Mr. Van Lancker said. Publishers are also devoting significant resources to developing apps that complement e-books and offer additional content from authors—from smoothie recipes and diet guidelines to “Curious George” games and daily affirmations inspired by the best-selling middle-grade novel “Wonder.” All are intended to keep mobile users engaged, and coming back for more books. The literary world is divided over whether a phone can deliver the experience of deep, concentrated reading. Scholars who study the subject note that smartphones are an important part of the effort to improve literacy in developing countries where books and computers are out of reach for many people. Reading on a phone is better than not reading at all, these experts all agree. But there is debate about whether the phone is appropriate for long-form reading, if other options are available. With all their ringing, dinging and buzzing, smartphones are designed to alert and distract users, notes Naomi S. Baron, a professor of linguistics at American University and author of “Words Onscreen: The Fate of Reading in a Digital World.” Even when a phone’s alerts are turned off, your brain is still primed for disruption when you pick it up, she said. That could make a phone worse for reading than an e-reader. “The phone is antithetical to deep reading,” said Maryanne Wolf, a neuroscientist at Tufts University who studies the reading brain. For most people, she said, a phone will make concentrated reading more difficult— though not impossible. Anna Todd, writer of the “After” series on the serial publishing platform Wattpad, argues that phones are encouraging people to read more. Wattpad has 40 million monthly users—almost 90% of whom are on mobile devices. “People should stop worrying about how other people are reading, and be glad that they are,” said Ms. Todd, whose series generated 1.3 billion chapter views and a book deal with Simon & Schuster. Many readers report being able to concentrate just fine on their phones. (Some turn off their alerts). On Twitter, people have celebrated major feats of reading, accomplished entirely on smartphones, including “Moby-Dick,” “War and Peace,” and “Swann’s Way.” No one expects phones to replace print books altogether. And even avid phone readers acknowledge the devices have drawbacks. Many report feeling caught off guard when they reach the end of a book. They miss the physical sense of how deep they are into a book—and the feelings of accomplishment and anticipation that come with that. Others note that it is not as easy to share an e-book with friends as a hardcover or paperback. Many still read in print part of the time. Laura Jefferson, 59, of Concord, N.H., reads on her iPhone for convenience —on the bus to Boston, in the doctor’s waiting room and eating lunch by herself at her favorite cafe in Concord. But when she knows she wants to lend a book to family or friends, she buys it in print. Lloyd Miller, a musician from Brooklyn who reads on his phone and in print, used his iPhone to dip into Donna Tartt’s tome “The Goldfinch,” and found himself trying to read under his jacket in a Brooklyn movie theater, where he had taken his children to see Disney’s “Frozen.” Mr. Miller, 41, said he prefers print, but downloads books on his phone for reading on the subway. He used his phone to read Hilary Mantel’s “Bring Up the Bodies,” and parts of Robert Caro’s fourth installment on Lyndon Johnson —which was too heavy to lug around. He also has his phone stocked with Beverly Cleary’s Ramona books and Judy Blume’s “Superfudge” series. Traveling around the city with his son and daughter, ages 7 and 10, the children often clamor for his phone. He hands it to them, saying, “No games, but you can read a book.” Write to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The rise of smartphone usage for reading is causing publishers to rethink the way books are designed, marketed and sold, with smaller screens in mind.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"In order to determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to analyze both statements and see if one necessarily follows from the other. Let's break down the components of the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"oh oh i oh i really like Mysteries\\" This statement expresses a strong preference for mysteries. The speaker is enthusiastic about mysteries and enjoys them. However, the premise does not mention any specific characteristic of mysteries. Hypothesis: \\"Even if a mystery is spooky I can't help but enjoy it.\\" This statement suggests that the speaker enjoys mysteries particularly when they are spooky. It implies that spookiness is a feature the speaker might find appealing and will not deter them from enjoying the mystery. The hypothesis addresses a specific aspect of mysteries (spookiness) and how it doesn't hinder the speaker's enjoyment. Now, let's consider whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Entailment means that the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, the premise only states that the speaker likes mysteries, but it does not mention anything about spookiness or whether the speaker enjoys spooky mysteries. Thus, the truth of the premise, i.e., the speaker liking mysteries, does not necessarily mean that the speaker will enjoy spooky mysteries. In conclusion, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise only indicates a general liking for mysteries without mentioning any specific characteristics. While the hypothesis delves into the aspect of spookiness, this detail is not necessarily implied or suggested by the premise. The premise is a broader statement, and the hypothesis focuses on a particular aspect of mysteries (spookiness), which is not encompassed in the premise."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - A cay (or ), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef. Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans (including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef). - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - Berkshire (or , abbreviated Berks) is a county in south east England, west of London. It was recognised as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of Windsor Castle by the Queen in 1957 and letters patent issued in 1974. Berkshire is a county of historic origin and is a home county, a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council. Berkshire County Council was the main county governance from 1889 to 1998 except for the separately administered County Borough of Reading. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - Eton Wick is a village currently in the English ceremonial county of Berkshire, but traditionally in Buckinghamshire, on the River Thames. According to the Grid Ref at the 2011 Census the population was included in the civil parish of Eton. It is very close to both the historic towns of Windsor and Eton, as well as Slough and Dorney Lake, the rowing venue for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The village has grown rapidly between the 1880s and the 2000s. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Windsor is a historic market town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire, England. It is widely known as the site of Windsor Castle, one of the official residences of the British Royal Family. - Bush Ait is an island of Clewer , Berkshire in the Thames on the reach above Boveney Lock at the mouth of the Clewer Mill Stream which leads to Windsor Racecourse Marina . The island is unpopulated and wooded . - Lake Island is an island on the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea. - The Thames Navigation Commission used to manage the River Thames in southern England. In particular, they were responsible for installing or renovating many of the locks on the river in the 18th and early 19th centuries - Clewer Mill Stream is a narrow twisting backwater of the River Thames near Windsor, Berkshire, England, which leaves the main river at Bush Ait and rejoins just above Queen Elizabeth Bridge. It is about 1.5 miles long. Clewer Mill Stream is named after the watermill that it once drove. - River Island is a London-headquartered high street fashion brand, which operates in a number of worldwide markets. Set up in 1948 by Bernard Lewis and his brothers in London, it is to this day still a private company owned by the Lewis family. - Windsor Racecourse, also known as Royal Windsor Racecourse, is a thoroughbred horse racing venue located in Windsor, Berkshire, England. It is one of only two figure-of-eight courses in the United Kingdom, the other being at Fontwell Park. - Boveney Lock is a lock on the River Thames situated on the Buckinghamshire bank opposite the Windsor Racecourse and close to Eton Wick. Boveney is a village a little way upstream on the same side. The lock was first built in 1838 by the Thames Navigation Commission. The lock was rebuilt in 1898 closer to the Buckinghamshire bank, and a set of boat rollers were installed on the old site. - Buckinghamshire (or ), abbreviated Bucks, is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east. - Boveney is a village in Buckinghamshire, England, near Windsor. - An ait (pronounced , like \\"eight\\") or eyot (pronounced , , or ) is a small island. It is especially used to refer to river islands found on the River Thames and its tributaries in England. - Clewer (also known as Clewer Village) is an ecclesiastical parish and an area of Windsor in the county of Berkshire, England. Clewer makes up three wards of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, namely Clewer North, Clewer South and Clewer East. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.

Polk's presidency, intent upon controlling a contested U.S.-Canada border area in the Oregon boundary dispute. Can we infer the following? 54-40 is a rock group whose name references the Oregon boundary dispute.","output":"Yes, we can infer that 54-40 is a rock group whose name references the Oregon boundary dispute. Formed in Vancouver, British Columbia, the Canadian alternative rock group chose the name 54-40 as a nod to the historical slogan \\"Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!\\" This phrase emerged in the mid-19th century during the administration of U.S. President James K. Polk and encapsulates the expansionist sentiment in the United States at the time. The Oregon boundary dispute was a significant political issue in the early 19th century involving the United States and Britain, which controlled the colonial territories of present-day Canada. The disputed territory stretched from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean and comprised what is now Oregon, Washington, and parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming in the United States, as well as British Columbia in Canada. The slogan \\"Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!\\" signifies the latitude line 54°40' north, which marked the northern boundary of the Oregon Territory. Proponents of this expansionist agenda demanded that the United States obtain control of the entire territory up to this latitude, with the alternative being to wage war with Britain. Although President Polk campaigned on a platform of expanding American territories, his administration eventually agreed to a compromise with Britain to avoid war. In the Oregon Treaty of 1846, both parties settled on the 49th parallel as the border between the United States and British North America, with Vancouver Island remaining under British control. Consequently, the slogan \\"Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!\\" was not fully realized, as the United States did not gain control of the entire disputed area. The name 54-40 for the Canadian alternative rock group not only signifies this historical connection with the Oregon boundary dispute but also highlights their roots in the Pacific Northwest and acknowledges the rich tapestry of history that has shaped the region. By using the slogan as their moniker, the band embraces the duality of national identities stemming from the U.S.-Canada border dispute and perhaps unintentionally showcases the interwoven cultural narratives of the two countries."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

To find out what 'q' is, we need to subtract the 1336 candies from the 1456 candies: 1456 - 1336 = 120 So, we're left with 24 groups of 'q' candies equaling 120 candies. Now we want to find out how many candies are in each group of 'q' candies. So we need to divide 120 candies by 24 groups: 120 / 24 = 5 candies So, 'q' equals 5 candies! The answer to the problem is q = 5."},{"instruction":"The war changed the ethnic and religious profile of the city.

The meeting took place just nine months after the discovery of","output":"Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba led to a tense 13-day standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union, an event now known as the Cuban Missile Crisis. The crisis brought the two superpowers to the brink of nuclear war and further heightened fears of an all-out conflict during the ongoing Cold War. In an effort to prevent future crises and improve relations between the two nations, Kennedy saw the proposed ban on above-ground nuclear tests as a crucial step forward in reducing tensions. In addition to the United States, Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, over 100 other countries have since signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), which remains one of the key agreements in international arms control history. The treaty has contributed to a significant decrease in nuclear tests, with only a few instances of violations documented since its implementation. In the years that followed the signing of the LTBT, U.S. and Soviet leaders undertook further diplomatic efforts to mitigate the risk of nuclear war and address other contentious issues, such as the division of Berlin and limitations on offensive and defensive strategic weapons. These efforts eventually culminated in a series of arms control agreements, most notably the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). Although the Cold War ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the legacy of the LTBT and subsequent arms control agreements continue to shape the current landscape of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament efforts. Today, various international organizations and initiatives, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), work to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote disarmament. In conclusion, the release of the recordings highlighting President Kennedy's desire to thaw U.S.-Soviet relations demonstrates the crucial role that the proposed ban on above-ground nuclear tests played in easing Cold War tensions. The LTBT and later agreements helped to establish a foundation for ongoing diplomatic and arms control efforts, which remain essential components of global security."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a list.

Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet (; 2 June 1857 – 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies. He also composed choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs. He was appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1924. Although Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory. In his fifties, Elgar composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful.

Choosing and cultivating the right grape varieties: It is crucial to choose the right grape varieties suitable for the specific type of wine you want to produce. Different grape varieties have distinct characteristics, such as flavors, acidity, tannin levels, and sugar content. These characteristics play a significant role in determining the final taste and quality of the wine. To choose the right grape variety, factors such as climate, soil type, and regional preferences should be taken into account. Some common grape varieties used in winemaking include Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Riesling, and Sauvignon Blanc. 2. Cultivating the grapes: After choosing the appropriate grape variety, it is essential to cultivate them properly to ensure high-quality wine production. This involves proper planting, pruning, and management of the grapevines throughout their growth cycle. The cultivation process aims to achieve an optimal balance between vine growth, fruit production, and overall vine health. Key aspects of grapevine cultivation include: - Soil preparation: Prior to planting, the soil should be analyzed and amended according to the specific requirements of the chosen grape variety. - Planting: Grapevines are typically planted in rows for easier maintenance and to allow for sufficient sunlight exposure. - Pruning: Regular pruning helps to control vine growth, promotes optimal fruit development, and ensures the overall health of the vine. Pruning is typically done during the dormant season, which helps reduce the risk of infection. - Canopy management: This involves controlling the growth of leaves and shoots to provide optimal exposure to sunlight and air circulation. Canopy management also helps prevent diseases and ensures that the grapes have adequate access to nutrients. - Pest and disease control: It is crucial to monitor and manage pests and diseases, such as fungus and insects, to protect the grapevines and ensure a healthy harvest. - Irrigation and fertilization: Proper watering and nutrient management are critical for maintaining the health and productivity of grapevines. By carefully selecting the right grape varieties, cultivating and managing the grapevines, you can ensure a successful harvest.

We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the common factor, b. b(1917) / b = b(1919) / b Step 4: Simplify the equation. On the left-hand side, b/b reduces to 1, leaving: 1917 = 1919 Step 5: Interpret the result.

Regular script typefaces are often used to teach students Chinese characters, and often aim to match the standard forms of the region where they are meant to be used. Most typefaces in the Song dynasty were regular script typefaces which resembled a particular person's handwriting (e.g. the handwriting of Ouyang Xun, Yan Zhenqing, or Liu Gongquan), while most modern regular script typefaces tend toward anonymity and regularity. What are commonly used?","output":"In the context of Chinese typography and fonts, the following typefaces are commonly used: 1. Ming: Ming is the most common typeface used for body text in Chinese typography. It is characterized by its neat, legible appearance and clear distinctions between different characters. Ming's origins can be traced back to the Song dynasty, and its popularity has persisted due to its versatility and readability. 2. Sans-serif: Sans-serif typefaces are another popular choice for body text in Chinese typography. These fonts do not have the small lines or embellishments at the ends of the strokes, as found in Ming typefaces, resulting in a cleaner and more contemporary look. Sans-serif fonts are often used in digital environments, such as websites and apps, for their modern appearance and compatibility with screen displays. 3. Regular Script: As mentioned in your passage, regular script typefaces are less common in body text than Ming and sans-serif typefaces. However, they still hold an essential place in Chinese typography, particularly in educational settings where students learn the standard forms of Chinese characters. These typefaces tend to resemble traditional handwriting styles of notable historical calligraphers. 4. Running Script (Semi-cursive): Running script is a more fluid and connected form of written Chinese compared to the regular script. It is often used for informal settings, artwork, and calligraphy-based fonts. The characters in running script fonts flow together more seamlessly, making them less suitable for body text but aesthetically appealing for specific purposes. 5. Seal Script: Seal script is an ancient style of Chinese calligraphy that dates back to the Zhou dynasty. This script is characterized by its intricate, stylized characters and is often used for official seals, logos, and artwork. Although not suitable for body text, seal script typefaces play a crucial role in preserving Chinese history and culture. 6. Clerical Script: Clerical script is another ancient form of Chinese calligraphy, originating from the Han dynasty. It features bold, heavy strokes, with squared-off ends, creating a more formal appearance than other scripts. Clerical script typefaces are not typically used for body text but can be found in historical documents, titles, and headings for a classic, elegant look. In conclusion, while Ming and sans-serif typefaces dominate the landscape of body text in Chinese typography, various other scripts play essential roles in specific applications, such as education, artwork, and historical preservation.

In this article, we will examine the possible causes for this situation, explore the consequences, and discuss potential solutions for improving the reliability of the justice system. Main Section I) Root Causes: What led to the witness absence? Investigating the underlying factors that led to the dismissal of these criminal cases is crucial for understanding where the process has broken down and determining how to prevent it from happening again in the future. a) Fear: One of the primary reasons for witnesses’ reluctance to attend court proceedings could be fear for personal safety. The threat of retaliation, particularly in cases involving organized crime, gangs, or violent individuals, may force potential witnesses to reconsider their involvement in the process. b) Financial burden: The cost of attending court, particularly for those who are self-employed or have childcare responsibilities, can also be prohibitive for potential witnesses. Lost income and additional expenses may make attending court an unfeasible option for some. c) Inefficiencies in the legal system: Delays in providing witness summonses and poor communication with witnesses can also contribute to witness absence. The cumbersome bureaucracy associated with the criminal justice system can often lead to confusion and mismanagement, leaving potential witnesses unsure of their obligations and commitments. II) Consequences: How does witness absence impact the justice system? The rapid increase in abandoned criminal trials due to witness absence undermines the public's trust in the judicial system and has significant ramifications for all parties involved. a) Injustice for victims: Victims of criminal cases are deprived of the opportunity for legal redress when trials do not proceed due to witness absence, leading to a lack of closure and prolonged suffering. b) Unfair treatment of the accused: Individuals accused of crimes are not given a fair opportunity to defend themselves in court when witnesses are absent, potentially causing a failure to thoroughly analyze the evidence against them. c) Strain on the legal system: Court staff, police, and legal professionals must invest time and resources in preparing for criminal trials, making abandoned cases a considerable drain on the justice system. III) Potential Solutions: Addressing the problem of witness absence It is evident that urgent action is required to address the problem of witness absence in criminal trials. Stakeholders must work together to develop strategies that ensure the safety and support of witnesses and streamline the legal process. a) Enhanced witness protection programs: Ensuring that witnesses feel secure in their participation in criminal trials is essential. Developing comprehensive witness protection programs that guarantee the safety of witnesses before, during, and after the court proceedings may help to encourage higher witness attendance. b) Financial support for witnesses: Providing financial support for witnesses to cover lost income and childcare expenses can help to reduce the burden of attending court and encourage witness participation. c) Improve communication and efficiency: Streamlining the legal process to reduce delays and provide clear, accessible information to witnesses will make it easier for them to understand their role in the trial and attend court as required. Conclusion The current high rate of abandoned criminal trials in England and Wales due to witnesses pulling out or not appearing at court is unsustainable and must be addressed immediately. Through a combination of improved witness protection, financial support, and increased efficiency in the legal system, it is possible to reduce the number of dismissed cases and restore public confidence in the criminal justice system. It is time to invest in safeguarding the judicial process to ensure that justice is served fairly and effectively for all citizens."},{"instruction":"Singh claimed his ninth win Sunday - the most on the PGA Tour in 54 years - as he cruised to a five-stroke victory at the 5 million Chrysler Championship.

Analyze the context: Ash hasn't seen their grandmother in a long time and has decided to make a trip to see her. This shows that Ash values their relationship with their grandmother and is making an effort to reconnect. 2. Consider possible emotions: Given the context, Ash might feel a range of emotions such as excitement, happiness, nervousness, or nostalgia. 3. Evaluate the emotions: - Excitement: Ash might be excited about the prospect of catching up with their grandmother and spending time together after a long time apart. - Happiness: Visiting a loved one like a grandmother often brings feelings of happiness due to family bonds and shared memories. - Nervousness: If it has been a long time since they last met, Ash might feel a little nervous about how the visit will go, or if there have been any changes in their grandmother's life or health. - Nostalgia: Visiting their grandmother might bring back memories of their past experiences together, leading to feelings of nostalgia. Based on these evaluations, while Ash's specific emotions may vary, it is likely that they might feel a combination of excitement, happiness, nervousness, and nostalgia when visiting their grandmother after a long time apart."},{"instruction":"Answer the question Four students compared the total mass of the products to the total mass of the reactants after performing three trials of the same chemical reaction.

Student 1: The reaction converted some of the reactant mass to energy. Student 2: The chemical reaction produced a gas that escaped. Student 3: Some of the mass measurements were made with insufficient precision. Student 4: Heat released during the reaction caused the volume of the products to increase.Which students offered the most reasonable explanations?","output":"To find the most reasonable explanations, let's analyze each student's proposal step by step while considering the law of conservation of mass, which states that mass cannot be created or destroyed in a closed system during chemical reactions. 1. Student 1: The reaction converted some of the reactant mass to energy. - While the mass-energy equivalence principle (E=mc^2) shows that mass can be converted to energy, this is typically not a factor in ordinary chemical reactions. Mass-energy conversion usually occurs in nuclear reactions. So, this explanation is unlikely. 2. Student 2: The chemical reaction produced a gas that escaped. - This explanation is plausible because if a gas is produced during the reaction and it's not adequately contained, the gas can escape, leading to a lower total mass of products measured compared to the mass of reactants. 3. Student 3: Some of the mass measurements were made with insufficient precision. - This explanation is also plausible because if the students did not measure the mass accurately, it could create an appearance of a mass discrepancy between reactants and products. 4. Student 4: Heat released during the reaction caused the volume of the products to increase. - Although heat might cause an increase in volume, it does not account for the decrease in total mass. Therefore, this explanation does not address the observed mass difference. Based on the analysis, Students 2 and 3 offered the most reasonable explanations."},{"instruction":"Given the below context: Despite William Bruce's fall from political favour, and his intermittent imprisonment, he continued to practice. During the 1690s he completed Hill of Tarvit (1696), Craighall (1697–99) in Fife, and Craigiehall (1699) near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th-century remodelling, carried out by William Adam. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval \\"squint\\" giving a view of the pulpit.In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed until two years after Bruce's death, and the extent of his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed on the roof of the King James VI Hospital in nearby Perth. Guess a valid title for it!

The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Γραικοί). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an area in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, the location of the great deluge of Deucalion, a land occupied by the Selloi and the \\"Greeks\\" who later came to be known as \\"Hellenes\\". Selloi were the priests of Dodonian Zeus and the word probably means \\"sacrificers\\" (compare Gothic saljan, \\"present, sacrifice\\"). There is currently no satisfactory etymology of the name Hellenes. Some scholars assert that the name Selloi changed to Sellanes and then to Hellanes-Hellenes. However this etymology connects the name Hellenes with the Dorians who occupied Epirus and the relation with the name Greeks given by the Romans becomes uncertain. The name Hellenes seems to be older and it was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League. This was an ancient association of Greek tribes with twelve founders which was organized to protect the great temples of Apollo in Delphi (Phocis) and of Demeter near Thermopylae (Locris).

Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is selecting the right type of coffee beans for the desired flavor and strength of the coffee. Coffee beans come in various types, origins, roast levels, and flavors, and the choice of beans plays a crucial role in determining the final taste and aroma of the brewed coffee. Here's a more detailed explanation of the process, including the missing first step: 1. Selecting and purchasing coffee beans: - Choose between Arabica and Robusta beans, which have different taste profiles and caffeine levels. Arabica beans tend to have a smoother and more delicate flavor, while Robusta beans are known for their stronger, more robust character. - Look for the origin of the beans, as it can affect the flavor. Beans from Central and South America have a light to medium body with a bright acidity, African beans typically offer fruity and floral notes, and Indonesian beans are known for their earthy and spicy flavors. - Consider the roast level, which can range from light to dark. Light and medium roasts preserve the beans' original flavors, while dark roasts create a more robust and bitter taste that can mask the beans' nuances. 2. The water is poured into the machine at the back. 3. Coffee beans are put into a grinder. 4. The grinder is activated, ensuring the ground coffee has a consistent texture which suits the brewing method being used (e.g., coarse grind for French press, medium grind for drip coffee makers, fine grind for espresso machines). 5. A filter is put into the coffee maker, which can be made of paper, metal, or cloth, depending on the desired flavor and brewing method. 6. The ground coffee is put into the filter, typically in a ratio of about 2 tablespoons per 6 ounces of water for regular-strength coffee, although personal preferences may vary. 7. Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to counteract bitterness and enhance the coffee's flavor profile. 8. The top of the machine is closed, ensuring proper pressure and water distribution during the brewing process. 9. The power is turned on, activating the coffee maker and heating the water to the optimal temperature, commonly 195-205 °F (90-96 °C). 10. The water passes through the grounds, extracting soluble flavor compounds, oils, and aroma, which then combine with the water to create the final brewed coffee. The proper selection of coffee beans, along with following each step with care and precision, will result in a rich and flavorful cup of coffee that any coffee enthusiast will appreciate."},{"instruction":"Q:I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Answer: no"},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Jumping on your bike, even in the city, is becoming increasingly popular--- in London, for example, cycle use has more than doubled in the past ten years. So, which is the best bike for you? If you're traveling to work, a folding bike such as one of the models here is suitable unless you're cycling more than a couple of miles, in which case it might be uncomfortable . You can take a fold-up on the train and as it goes indoors with you, it's secure . For longer journeys, a road bike with drop handlebars and narrow tyres is a good choice. Try Specialized, from PS400. Note that the riding position encourages you to look downwards, which can be dangerous. Mountain bikes are best suited to off-road travel; their fat and strong tyres are good for climbing steep, muddy slopes . Good brands include Trek and Giant, with prices starting at less than PS300. A hybrid bike (halfway between a mountain bike and a road bike) is a good compromise with more upright riding position and thin, fast tyres. Ridgeback makes great hybrids, from around PS350. For a classic sit-up-and-beg bike, it's still hard to beat Pashley, which makes its bikes by hand. Expect to pay around PS500. Once you've picked your bike, sizing is crucial or you may suffer back or neck pain. A famous bike shop will help you choose the right size frame. The height of the seat should be adjusted carefully---again, a good shop will advise. If you only plan to cycle once or twice a month, you can choose a lower-priced bike, but for regular use, paying more means better quality: cheaper bikes need more frequent adjustment of brakes and gears ---and tend to be heavier, too. Finally, items such as mudguards aren't always included. Question: The main purpose of this passage is to _ . Options: A: give advice on how to choose a bike B: advertise some famous bike brands C: encourage people to go to work by bike D: introduce the advantages of different bikes","output":"To determine the main purpose of the passage, let's take a closer look at the content presented: 1. The article mentions the growing popularity of cycling. 2. It discusses folding bikes and their suitability for short commutes and security. 3. It talks about road bikes, mountain bikes, hybrid bikes, and classic bikes, providing examples of good brands and their costs. 4. The article emphasizes the importance of sizing and choosing a quality bike, as well as additional features like mudguards. Based on this information, the main purpose of the passage can be concluded as: A: give advice on how to choose a bike This option encompasses the main points of the article, as it provides information on different types of bikes, their uses, and factors to consider when purchasing one. The other options are too focused on specific aspects and do not address the overall content of the passage."},{"instruction":"The Maldives faces the threat of extinction from rising sea levels, but the government said on Thursday it was looking to the future with plans to build homes and a golf course that float. An increase in sea levels of just 18 to 59 centimeters would make the Maldives -- a nation of tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean -- virtually uninhabitable by 2100, the UN's climate change panel has warned. President Mohamed Nasheed has vowed a fight for survival, and last month he signed a deal with a Dutch company to study proposals for a floating structure that could support a convention centre, homes and an 18-hole golf course. \\"It is still early stages and we are awaiting a report on the possibility,\\" a government official said. The company, Dutch Docklands, is currently building floating developments in the Netherlands and Dubai. There was no immediate comment from the firm but its website said it undertook projects that make \\"land from water by providing large-scale floating constructions to create similar conditions as on land\\". The Maldives began work on an artificial island known as the Hulhumale near the crowded capital island of Male in 1997 and more than 30,000 people have been settled there to ease _ . The city, which has a population of 100,000, is already protected from rising sea levels by a 30-million-dollar sea wall, and the government is considering increasingly imaginative ways to combat climate change. Nasheed, who staged the world's first underwater cabinet meeting in October to highlight his people's dilemma , has even spoken of buying land elsewhere in the world to enable Maldivians to relocate if their homes are flooded. He has also pledged the Hulhumale to turn his nation into a model for the rest of the world by becoming \\"carbon neutral\\" by 2020.

He would lose a bit of his sanity (2). He was devastated at the loss of his wife and friend (3). not enough information (4). He would lose his job Q: Yes, and I am not proud of it, but grief makes you do some really stupid things. My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up. She just married that person 2 weeks ago, and honestly….I just want her to be happy. I miss her, I always will, and in hindsight, I don’t know why she stayed with me as long as she did. I was not an easy person to love. Question: The person most likely feels like: === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"(2). He was devastated at the loss of his wife and friend. The person in this scenario is feeling devastated at the loss of his wife and friend. The suddenness of his wife leaving him and entering into a relationship with a close friend on the same day left him completely blindsided and in shock. He was not only grieving the loss of his wife but also the loss of his best friend, which in this case, was his wife. The pain of losing her family, whom he cared about, deepened his feelings of devastation and loss. His grief and emotional turmoil led him to do something he is not proud of: creating a fake Facebook account to check on his ex-wife's page and communicate with her through instant messaging. He thought that talking to her, even if not as himself, would help him cope with the loss and somehow keep her in his life. Unfortunately, this action only made matters worse, as it led him to discover photos of her with someone else, which deeply hurt him. His desperation to hold onto the connection with his wife eventually led to him being discovered, as he accidentally revealed his location and was called out by his ex-wife. He recognizes that he was the grieving idiot unwilling to give up, and it only caused him further pain. Despite everything, the person now just wishes for his ex-wife's happiness, admitting he was not an easy person to love and questioning why she stayed with him as long as she did. The love and attachment he felt for her, as well as the realization that he may not have been the best partner, make it clear that this individual was, and likely still is, feeling devastated at the loss of his wife and friend."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Becca Crane (Jenn Proske) moves to Sporks to live with her clueless father, Sheriff Frank (Diedrich Bader), after her mother starts an affair with Tiger Woods.

Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate.

The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - The Mojave Desert is an arid rain-shadow desert and the driest desert in North America. It is located in the southwestern United States, primarily within southeastern California and southern Nevada, and it occupies a total of . Very small areas also extend into Utah and Arizona. Its boundaries are generally noted by the presence of Joshua trees, which are native only to the Mojave Desert and are considered an indicator species, and it is believed to support an additional 1,750 to 2,000 species of plants. The central part of the desert is sparsely populated, while its peripheries support large communities such as Las Vegas, Lancaster, Palmdale, Victorville, and St. George. - A natural arch, natural bridge or, less commonly, a rock arch is a natural rock formation where an arch has formed with an opening underneath. Natural arches commonly form where inland cliffs, coastal cliffs, fins or stacks are subject to erosion from the sea, rivers or weathering (subaerial processes). - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A canyon (Spanish: cañón) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering. - Horse Ranch Mountain is the highest summit in Zion National Park, in Utah. Located in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, it rises above Camp Creek to the north and Taylor Creek to the south. - The Life Zone concept was developed by C. Hart Merriam in 1889 as a means of describing areas with similar plant and animal communities. Merriam observed that the changes in these communities with an increase in latitude at a constant elevation are similar to the changes seen with an increase in elevation at a constant latitude. - Springdale is a town in Washington County, Utah, United States. The population was 529 at the 2010 census. It is located immediately outside the boundaries of Zion National Park, and is oriented around the resulting tourist industry. It was originally settled as a Mormon farming community in 1862 by evacuees from the flooding of nearby Northrop. Springdale was named one of the 20 'prettiest towns' in the United States by Forbes Traveler in 2008. - A butte is an isolated hill with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top; buttes are smaller than mesas, plateaus, and table landforms. The word butte comes from a French word meaning \\"small hill\\"; its use is prevalent in the Western United States, including the southwest where \\"mesa\\" is also used for the larger landform. Because of their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in plains and mountainous areas. In differentiating mesas and buttes, geographers use the rule of thumb that a mesa has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height. - Navajo Sandstone is a geologic formation in the Glen Canyon Group that is spread across the U.S. states of southern Nevada, northern Arizona, northwest Colorado, and Utah as part of the Colorado Plateau province of the United States. - Zion National Park is located in the Southwestern United States, near Springdale, Utah. A prominent feature of the park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to half a mile (800 m) deep, cut through the reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest elevation is at Coalpits Wash and the highest elevation is at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park's unique geography and variety of life zones allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. - The Colorado Plateau, also known as the Colorado Plateau Province, is a physiographic region of the Intermontane Plateaus, roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. The province covers an area of 337,000 km (130,000 mi) within western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, southern and eastern Utah, and northern Arizona. About 90% of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries: the Green, San Juan, and Little Colorado. Most of the remainder of the plateau is drained by the Rio Grande and its tributaries. - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location. - Woodland is a low-density forest forming open habitats with plenty of sunlight and limited shade. Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses. Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession. Higher density areas of trees with a largely closed canopy that provides extensive and nearly continuous shade are referred to as forests. - The Great Basin is the largest area of contiguous endorheic watersheds in North America. It is noted for both its arid climate and the basin and range topography that varies from the North American low point at Badwater Basin to the highest point of the contiguous United States, less than away at the summit of Mount Whitney. The region spans several physiographic divisions, biomes/ecoregions, and deserts. - The Virgin River is a tributary of the Colorado River in the U.S. states of Utah, Nevada, and Arizona.

She says yes Burk: It's IBM's directors' responsibility to insist their CEO be treated like \\"one of the boys\\" Well, well. The boys at Augusta National Golf Club -- members and sponsors alike -- are in a big bind. Nine years after I led an unsuccessful effort by the National Council of Women's Organizations to open membership in the club to women, the \\"woman problem\\" is back. This time it involves Virginia Rometty, the first female chief executive of IBM. IBM is a major sponsor of Augusta National's Masters Golf Tournament, and up to now its CEOs have always been given membership in the club. But none has ever been a woman. So what happens now -- will Augusta National open its doors to women? Or will IBM pull its sponsorship and force its other executives to resign their club memberships? These are the only two real choices. Martha Burk We've said all along that this is not about golf. It is about access to the places where big business is done, deals are made and careers are boosted or broken. Half of Augusta's membership (which reads like a roster of Fortune 500 CEOs) probably doesn't even care about golf, but the members do care about power relationships. According to Fortune magazine , \\"golf remains the true communications hub of America's business elite.\\" Back in 2003 when opposition to the all-male policy was making headlines, I got two calls from sponsors who said they were \\"in dialogue\\" with the club. The first was from Coca-Cola, saying its board was going to make a decision after talking to \\"Warren (Buffett) and Sam (Nunn),\\" board members who were also Augusta members. I was promised a call in the next two or three days. I'm still waiting. My second call was much more hostile. It was from IBM, telling me my organization was \\"forcing\\" them to do something they didn't want to do, and generally dressing me down for making an issue of the bald-faced sexism that their sponsorship supported. JUST WATCHED Erin Burnett's essay on Ginnie Rometty Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Erin Burnett's essay on Ginnie Rometty 01:54 A few days later Hootie Johnson, then chairman of Augusta National, stepped to a microphone and announced the club was releasing its sponsors, broadcasting the tournament without commercials. The boys had clearly made a deal that went like this: We'll \\"release\\" you as sponsors, you'll keep your mouths shut, and when all this woman stuff blows over you can quietly come back. Two of the three did not return (IBM was the exception), but none of the sponsors ever condemned the male-only policy at Augusta National. IBM is surely scrambling for what it hopes will be another face-saving deal. The CBSSports.com senior golf columnist Steve Elling predicts that club Chairman Billy Payne will offer Rometty a membership a few days after the Masters ends next week: \\"She shows up at the tournament in 2013 in green, after the gender issue has died down. That way, the club avoids the appearance that Payne has been backed into a corner or forced into making an accommodation.\\" Sorry, but that dog won't hunt. Telling Rometty to be a good girl and wait a little longer with IBM's collusion would be a disaster -- not only for the company's image, but for Rometty's credibility as its leader. Elling's scenario would scream that IBM values the relationship with a club that proudly discriminates more than it values its own integrity -- or its first female CEO. What if, on the other hand, Rometty makes an announcement that she's not interested in membership? That won't work either. It would be widely assumed that she was under pressure from the company to make such a statement, and in the bargain accept her second-class status. After all, CEOs (male and female) don't get where they are by making waves. But fixing this shouldn't be put on her. It's the responsibility of the board of directors to insist that their CEO be treated exactly like -- well -- one of the boys. Besides, whether she would accept a membership is completely irrelevant to the question of the appropriateness of the club's all-male policy and IBM's tacit support of it, and it doesn't get the club out of its bind anyway. Before she can reject a membership, she has to be offered one. If Augusta National admits it was prepared to make an offer but she wouldn't accept, it has admitted that membership is open to women, and it will immediately be asked who the next candidate will be and when. If the club remains silent, IBM's problem reverberates louder. And saying the gender issue will die down is wishful thinking. The women's movement opened the doors to the executive suites for women like Rometty with 30 years of hard work that made sex discrimination in hiring and promotion in corporate America illegal. If we hadn't raised the ruckus in 2003, you can bet it wouldn't be front and center now. And though we haven't succeeded yet, we won't stop until females are treated equally in corporate-supported venues like Augusta National Golf Club, or until those companies are shamed into pulling support. If this were about race discrimination and a black (male) CEO, IBM surely wouldn't be in the mix, and no other national sponsor would go near this club. But it's only the girls -- and sex discrimination is just not as serious. Or is it? We're listening for IBM's answer. ||||| (CNN) -- President Obama on Thursday made clear his view on the membership of women at the Augusta National Golf Club: They should be admitted. The issue of the membership of the club that hosts most prestigious golf tournament is being scrutinized because the top executive at IBM, Ginni Rometty, is a woman. IBM's sponsorship of the Masters tournament guarantees club membership for its officers, but the club does not allow women to join. The White House weighed in Thursday. \\"The president's answer is yes, he believes women should be admitted,\\" White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters at a briefing. Specifically, Obama believes it is \\"up to the club to decide, (but) his personal opinion is that women should be admitted to the club.\\" The Republican presidential candidates also weighed in. Mitt Romney agreed that it is up to the club to decide on female members when asked about the issue at a campaign event Thursday. \\"Of course,\\" he said. \\"I am not a member of Augusta. I don't know if I would qualify. My golf game is not that good. Certainly if I were a member, if I could run Augusta, which isn't likely to happen, of course I'd have women into Augusta.\\" Rick Santorum, in a statement e-mailed to reporters, said, \\"I encourage Augusta to accept women members, but I recognize their right as a private organization to decide for themselves.\\" Newt Gingrich said his wife, Callista, a golfer herself, would be a \\"great member.\\" During his annual media session Wednesday, Billy Payne, chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club, did not comment specifically on Rometty. \\"Well, as has been the case, whenever that question is asked, all issues of membership are now and have historically been subject to the private deliberation of members,\\" he said. \\"That statement remains accurate; it remains my statement.\\" IBM spokesman Ed Barbini told CNN on Wednesday that the company would not comment on the controversy. Most Augusta patrons seem untroubled by the policy The question of Rometty's membership has again brought the gender controversy to the forefront. Women's rights activist Martha Burk tried to change the exclusionary policy nine years ago when she showed up at the Augusta entrance to lead a series of protests against men-only membership. Her efforts were in vain. Now, she says, \\"the boys\\" at Augusta, members and sponsors alike, find themselves in a big bind. \\"The 'woman problem' is back,\\" she wrote in a column for CNN on Tuesday. Burk says there are only two choices at hand: Augusta can open its doors to women, or IBM can yank its money and force its male executives to resign from the club. \\"Those are the only two options that are viable that are going to wash with the public,\\" Burk told CNN last week. Augusta's membership -- which includes titans of industry and finance -- has been male-only since the club's opening in 1932. When Burk tried to change things in 2002, Augusta's then-chairman, Hootie Johnson, resisted, saying that gender integration would not come \\"at the point of a bayonet.\\" In 2006, Burk was among a group of Exxon shareholders who accused the company of violating its discrimination policies by supporting the tournament. Nonmembers can play on the course only when hosted by members. Augusta is famously secretive about its membership, and the club declined to comment on the issue, as did IBM spokesman Chris Andrews. \\"Augusta is a private club, and their personal membership is an internal matter,\\" he said. IBM, however, has played a role in changing policy before. The company pulled television ads from the PGA Championship when it was played at the whites-only Shoal Creek golf club in Alabama. The club admitted its first African-American in 1990 and now claims former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as a member. Augusta also did not welcome its first black member until 1990, when Gannett television division president Ron Townsend joined the club. On the eve of the 2012 Masters opening Thursday, speculation surfaced that Payne, known to be more progressive than his predecessor, would offer Rometty a membership, but only after the tournament ends and the gender debate dies down. \\"Sorry, but that dog won't hunt,\\" Burk wrote. \\"Telling Rometty to be a good girl and wait a little longer with IBM's collusion would be a disaster -- not only for the company's image, but for Rometty's credibility as its leader.\\" More and more people are asking Augusta to man up and get rid of what they say is a discriminatory policy from the past. Payne did not announce any sweeping changes from the hot seat Wednesday. That means that Rometty will probably not show up this year in a green jacket. The question is: Will she ever? |||||Summary:","output":"The Augusta National Golf Club, a special place where people play golf, doesn't allow women to become members. This year, a big company called IBM has a female boss, and usually, the boss of IBM gets to join the golf club. But since the boss is a woman, people are wondering what will happen. Some people think the golf club should let women join, while others think IBM should stop supporting the club if the lady boss can't join.

Step 2: Detail the experience Begin the review by detailing the date and time of the incident that led to the negative experience. This information is necessary to establish the context and environment that existed during the visit. Let's say the incident occurred last Friday night at 8 pm. Step 3: Describe the issues Describe the problems or issues that led to the negative experience without exaggeration or embellishment. For this example, some issues we could mention are poor customer service, long wait times, and unappetizing food. Step 4: Offer constructive criticism Offer suggestions for improvement so that the negative elements of our experience could potentially be addressed by the business owner. Constructive criticism is an important part of writing any review. Step 5: Be respectful Write the review in a respectful and professional tone, while still emphasizing the negative experience, and how it could deter potential customers from visiting the establishment. Example negative Yelp review: Title: Disappointing Experience at John's Bistro (1 out of 5 stars) Last Friday night at 8 pm, I decided to try John's Bistro in Anytown, USA for dinner with a group of friends. Unfortunately, we encountered a series of issues that severely impacted our dining experience and left us feeling unimpressed with the restaurant. Firstly, the overall customer service was subpar. The hostess seemed disinterested in accommodating our party, and it took an excessive amount of time for our server to greet us and take our drink orders. This was surprising, considering there were several empty tables and the restaurant did not appear to be overly busy. Secondly, we were not impressed with the food quality. Our appetizers arrived cold, and the main courses were lacking in flavor. This was particularly disappointing, considering the prices on the menu. Lastly, the waiting time between courses was exceptionally long. I understand that restaurants can get busy and sometimes slow down, but there were multiple instances where we felt neglected and frustrated waiting for our food. In hopes of improving future customers' experiences, I suggest that the management at John's Bistro focuses on training their staff to provide attentive and friendly customer service, as well as addressing issues related to food quality and the pacing of service. It may also be beneficial to re-evaluate their pricing structure to ensure customers feel they are getting value for their money. Unfortunately, based on my experience, I cannot recommend John's Bistro, and I am unlikely to return in the future.

If the metals remain soluble when solid, the alloy forms a solid solution, becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals, called a phase. If the mixture cools and the constituents become insoluble, they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals, creating a heterogeneous microstructure of different phases. However, in other alloys, the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs. These alloys are called intermetallic alloys because, if cooled very quickly, they first crystallize as a homogeneous phase, but they are supersaturated with the secondary constituents.

In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld. Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages. Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published. Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser. While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions.

Educational companies, libraries and the Internet provide many families with teaching materials. Parents choose home schooling for several reasons. Some choose it because of their religious beliefs. Others say it provides more time for the family to be together. They say the home offers a better place for learning. Some parents believe home schooling avoids learning. Some parents believe home schooling avoids problems of _ schools. Critics, however, say children need to attend school with other children. All fifty American states and the District of Columbia permit home schooling. Some states do not require much preparation by parents or testing of children. Other states have more requirements for home schooling. Home schooling in the United States began when the country was established. In farm areas, people often lived far from a school. Widespread home schooling took place until about the middle of the nineteenth century. Then, in 1852, the state of Massachusetts passed the first law requiring children to attend school. Over the years, the American public education system strengthened and grew. By the 1960s and 1970s, however, some Americans believed that traditional education was not helping their children. So a number of parents began home schooling. Home schooling expert Linda Dobson says many people have helped the movement grow. She says many kinds of people have joined the movement. These include rich people and poor people. They represent many races, religions and political beliefs.

As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more. And like every great ride, Julie was beautiful, fast, and could turn on a dime in the blink of an eye. \\"I don't understand, Dingo.\\" I couldn't tell if it was the 12 stitches over my eye giving me the headache or Julie's prattling. I bit off a stretch of red tape and put it over the empty socket where my taillight should have been while I balanced the phone between my shoulder and swollen cheek. \\"Julie, I told you. Darby took the box.\\" \\"I get that, but--.\\" \\"The box my dad hand-carved just before he died.\\" I could feel the two edges of skin stitched together pull at each other every time my jaw moved. \\"Yes, yes, and the box protects your family's dirty little secret or your mother's pride and joy or whatever the hell it is you're calling it this week.\\" \\"Hey, I told you not to go digging--. \\" \\"I don't care what it is, Dingo!

And I thought she was jealous just because somebody else got to beat the living crap out of me for a change. \\"Julie, I didn't even know she was in town until after I was in the hospital.\\" What was in the box? - Dingo's old photos - not enough information - His mother's letters - Some toys","output":"It is important to recognize that the passage you have provided is a fictional literary excerpt, potentially from a book or a short story. It focuses on the relationship between the narrator—who is referred to as Dingo—and Julie, as well as the mysterious box that Dingo's father hand-carved before passing away. In this context, the contents of the box are not explicitly mentioned or elaborated upon, leaving the reader with a sense of curiosity. However, based on the passage, we can speculate about a few possible items inside the box: 1. Dingo's old photos: It is possible that the box contains old photographs of Dingo's life that hold sentimental value. As the excerpt mentions that the box protects a secret or his mother's pride and joy, these photos might represent something important to Dingo and his family. 2. His mother's letters: Another possibility is that the box contains letters written by Dingo's mother, which may reveal some hidden truths or secrets about their family. This idea is reinforced by the mention of the family's \\"dirty little secret.\\" 3. Some toys: The box could contain toys that hold some sentimental or symbolic significance for Dingo. They might be a reminder of his childhood and family life. Unfortunately, without more information, it is impossible to precisely determine the contents of the box. Nonetheless, the passage suggests that the box's contents are significant to Dingo and his family, as well as a source of mystery and curiosity for the reader."},{"instruction":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Shundagarh is a village on India's east-facing coast.It is a village of simple mud and grass houses built on the beach just above the waterline.The Khadra Hills rise immediately behind the village,to a height of one hundred and fifty meters.A simple,good-hearted old man,whose name was Jalpur,farmed two small fields on the very edge of these hills.From his fields he could see the fishing boats that travelled up and down the coast.He could see the children playing on the sands;their mothers washing clothes on the flat stones where the Shiva River flowed into the sea;and their fathers landing the latest catch or repairing nets and telling stories that had no end.

The desks and chairs make students have the correct posture, especially when reading and writing. Each desk has an adjustable steel bar. The bar can help students keep their eyes at least 30cm from books. Zhang Jianming is headmaster of the primary school.

The Central Intelligence Agency gets word that their Special Activities Division operative Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) has been captured trying to free an Englishwoman, Elizabeth Hadley (Catherine McCormack), from a Chinese prison near Su Chou (Suzhou). Bishop is being questioned under torture and will be executed within twenty-four hours unless he is claimed by the U.S. Government, so they scramble to decide what to doif they claim Bishop as an agent, they risk destroying the trade agreement. Exacerbating the situation is the fact that Bishop was operating in a \\"rogue\\" capacity without permission from the Agency.In an attempt to quickly deal with the situation, CIA executives call in Nathan Muir (Robert Redford), an aging mid-level case officer on his last day before retirement, and the man who recruited Bishop. Although they tell Muir that they simply need him to act as a \\"stop gap\\" to fill in some holes in their background files, the officials are in reality hoping that what he gives them is the smoking gun they need to justify letting Bishop die. Realizing as much, Muir attempts to save Bishop by leaking the story to CNN through a contact in Hong Kong, believing that the CIA will rescue Tom once a public outcry puts pressure on them to do so. Unfortunately for Muir, the tactic only stalls them, as a phone call to the FCC from a high ranking executive results in CNN retracting the story.During the debriefing, referred to above, Muir describes how he recruited Bishop into the MACV-SOG while the latter was an Marine Corps sniper in Vietnam.

Article: While I was waiting outside my wife's office building for her to get out of work, I saw a beggar coming my way from across the parking lot. \\"I hope he doesn't ask me for any money,\\" I thought. He didn't. He came and sat in front of the bus stop, but he didn't look like he could have enough money to ride the bus. After a few minutes he spoke. \\"That's a pretty car,\\" he said, pointing to my car. He was ragged , but he had an air of dignity about himself. I gave him a smile and continued cleaning my car. He sat there quietly as I worked. The expected asking for money never came. As the silence between us widened, it seemed that a voice inside me said, \\"Ask him if he needs any help.\\" I was sure that he would say \\"yes\\", but I listened to the inner voice. \\"Do you need any help?\\" I asked. He answered in three simple but meaningful words that I shall never forget. We often look for wisdom in great men and women, and we expect it from those of higher learning and achievements. I expected nothing but a dirty hand from him, but he said three words that shook me. \\"Don't we all?\\" he said. I was feeling high, successful and important above a beggar in the street, until those three words hit me like a shot. Don't we all? I needed help. Maybe not for a bus fare or for a place to sleep, but I needed help. I reached in my wallet and gave him not only for a bus fare, but enough to get a warm meal and shelter for the day. Those three little words still ring true. No matter how much you have, no matter how much you have achieved, you need help, too. No matter how little you have, no matter how loaded you are with problems, even without money or a place to sleep, you can give help.

It was formed by a merger of French Aérospatiale-Matra Missiles (of EADS, now Airbus Group), Italian Alenia Marconi Systems (now Leonardo) and British Matra BAe Dynamics (of BAE Systems) in December 2001. In 2015 the company had 10,000 employees. In 2015, MBDA recorded orders for €5.2bn and an order book of €15.1 bn. MBDA works with over 90 armed forces worldwide. - Radar is an object-detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed. Radar was developed secretly for military use by several nations in the period before and during World War II. The term \\"RADAR\\" was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging or RAdio Direction And Ranging. The term \\"radar\\" has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization. - British Aerospace Dynamics Limited (BADL or BAe Dynamics) was a division of British Aerospace. - Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS) was a major European integrated defence electronics company and an equal shares joint venture between BAE Systems and Finmeccanica until its dissolution on May 3, 2005. - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - Active radar homing (ARH) is a missile guidance method in which a missile contains a radar transceiver (in contrast to semi-active radar homing, which uses only a receiver) and the electronics necessary for it to find and track its target autonomously. NATO brevity code for an air-to-air active radar homing missile launch is Fox Three. - Brimstone is an air - launched ground attack missile developed by MBDA for Britain 's Royal Air Force . It was originally intended for \`\` fire - and - forget '' use against mass formations of enemy armour , using a millimetric wave ( mmW ) active radar homing seeker to ensure accuracy even against moving targets . Experience in Afghanistan led to the addition of laser guidance in the dual - mode Brimstone missile , allowing a \`\` spotter '' to pick out specific targets when friendly forces or civilians were in the area . The tandem shaped charge warhead is much more effective against modern tanks than older similar weapons such as the AGM - 65G Maverick , while the small blast area minimises collateral damage . Three Brimstones are carried on a launcher that occupies a single weapon station , allowing a single aircraft to carry many missiles . After a protracted development programme , single - mode or \`\` millimetric '' Brimstone entered service with RAF Tornado aircraft in 2005 , and the dual - mode variant in 2008 . The latter has been extensively used in Afghanistan and Libya . An improved Brimstone 2 was expected to enter service in October 2012 , but problems with the new warhead from TDW and the ROXEL rocket motor put back the planned date to November 2015 . MBDA is working on the targeting of swarms of small boats under the name Sea Spear . The RAF intend to fit Brimstone to their Eurofighter Typhoons , and planned to integrate it with their Harriers until they were withdrawn from service in 2010 . MBDA is studying the use of Brimstone on ships , attack helicopters , UAVs , and from surface launchers ; it will be integrated on the Lockheed Martin F - 35 Lightning II when the F - 35B enters British service . The United States , France and India have expressed interest in buying Brimstone for their aircraft , but Saudi Arabia is the only export customer as of 2015.The cost per missile has been quoted as £ 175,000 ( 263,000 ) each in 2015 , or ' over £ 100,000 ' . - BAE Systems plc is a British multinational defence, security and aerospace company. Its headquarters are in London in the United Kingdom and it has operations worldwide. It is among the world's largest defence companies; it was ranked as the third-largest based on applicable 2015 revenues. Its largest operations are in the United Kingdom and United States, where its BAE Systems Inc. subsidiary is one of the six largest suppliers to the US Department of Defense. Other major markets include Australia, India and Saudi Arabia. The company was formed on 30 November 1999 by the £7.7 billion merger of two British companies: Marconi Electronic Systems (MES) the defence electronics and naval shipbuilding subsidiary of the General Electric Company plc (GEC) and British Aerospace (BAe) an aircraft, munitions and naval systems manufacturer. - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - Matra BAe Dynamics was formed in August 1996 by merger of half the missile business of Matra Defense of France and BAe Dynamics (a division of British Aerospace) of the UK and was Europe's largest manufacturer of missiles and UAVs. What is the relationship between 'brimstone ' and 'marconi electronic systems'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'Brimstone' and 'Marconi Electronic Systems' lies in the development and manufacturing of the Brimstone missile. Brimstone is an air-launched ground attack missile developed by MBDA for Britain's Royal Air Force. MBDA, a European developer and manufacturer of missiles, was formed by the merger of several companies, including the French Aérospatiale-Matra Missiles (which was part of Marconi Electronic Systems), Italian Alenia Marconi Systems (now Leonardo), and British Matra BAe Dynamics (of BAE Systems) in December 2001. Before the formation of MBDA, Marconi Electronic Systems, a British company specializing in defense electronics and naval shipbuilding, was one of the key players in the industry. Its subsidiary, Matra Marconi Space (now Airbus Defense and Space), later merged with other European companies to form MBDA. The Brimstone missile is thus a product of the collaborative effort between these merged entities, which have their roots in companies like Marconi Electronic Systems."},{"instruction":"In 1955 , this became the Central Electricity Generating Board , which in turn became the Central Electricity Authority in 1957 .

(AP Photo/Andy Clayton-King) (Associated Press) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Protesters trying to stymie the Dakota Access oil pipeline sneaked up on a truss connected to the roof and rappelled down to unfurl a huge banner inside U.S. Bank Stadium during the Minnesota Vikings' season finale against the Chicago Bears. Play was not interrupted on the field during Sunday's game, but eight rows of fans seated below the banner were cleared as a precaution. The two protesters — a man and a woman — were later arrested for trespassing, Minneapolis police spokesman Officer Corey Schmidt said. The banner urged Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank to divest from the four-state, 3.8 billion pipeline. Opponents contend the pipeline could affect drinking water and Native American artifacts. Texas-based developer Energy Transfer Partners says the pipeline will be safe. The protesters rappelled into place during the second quarter, and then hung in a seated position about 100 feet above the seats that were evacuated for safety.

U.S. Bank spokesman Dana Ripley declined comment. The pipeline would carry oil from western North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to Illinois where it can be shipped on to users. Protesters camped in North Dakota for months to try to stop completion of construction. ___ Associated Press reporter Jeff Baenen contributed to this story from Minneapolis. ||||| Two protesters climbed a massive roof truss inside U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday afternoon and then, as thousands of astonished Vikings fans watched, dropped down to unfurl a banner protesting the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Minneapolis police officers and firefighters quickly made their way to the spot and spoke to the protesters from a catwalk above them, but left the pair dangling and their banner undisturbed until the game was over and the stadium began emptying out. Karl Mayo, 32, and Sen Holiday, 26, were booked into the Hennepin County jail on charges of burglary and trespassing, both gross misdemeanors. Carolyn Feldman, 27, also was booked on a related misdemeanor charge, obstructing the legal process, according to the Minneapolis Police. The high-wire protest began about 12:47 p.m., early in the second quarter of the Vikings-Bears football game, when the two men managed to clamber over a guardrail from a public concourse, then climb up a built-in ladder to a catwalk high above the purple seats. From there the men appeared to attach their banner to the ridge truss, then dropped down themselves using ropes and harnesses around their waists and legs. The rectangular white banner bore the USBank logo and the words, “Divest #NoDAPL,” a reference to the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, which has been the subject of national controversy and a monthslong protest encampment. On the field, the final game of the team’s snakebit inaugural season in the new stadium went on without interruption and the Vikings won. While the men dangled on high, security guards cleared fans from eight rows of seats in Section 120 just below. The truss the men climbed is just to the north of the giant video screen in the stadium’s east end zone. Mayo, who wore a purple Brett Favre No. 4 Vikings jersey, occasionally waved and smiled at the fans below and appeared to converse with law enforcement officers who were about 40 feet above on the catwalk. Initially, a Minneapolis Police officer climbed up to the catwalk, then came back down. Police later said he was a crisis manager. More firefighters and police climbed the ladder to the catwalk and remained there for the second half. The two men remained aloft until the game’s conclusion, when they hoisted themselves with apparent ease back up and onto the catwalk as the stadium’s sound system blared the Counting Crows song “Hanging Around.” The lingering postgame crowd cheered when the protesters climbed onto the catwalk, but booed them when they were safely back down the ladder. The banner remained in place as fans left. Rueful quarterback At his postgame news conference, Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said, “I swear to God I didn’t see them.” Quarterback Sam Bradford, when asked about the protesters, said ruefully, “Why wouldn’t the season end like that?” The two climbers were arrested, then evaluated by a physician from nearby Hennepin County Medical Center. Neither was injured and both refused medical treatment, the police said. While the men hung above the crowd, protest organizers e-mailed a release to news outlets quoting Holiday saying, “We are here in solidarity with water protectors from Standing Rock to urge U.S. Bank to divest from the Dakota Access Pipeline.” The protest’s organizers contend that U.S. Bank has tens of millions of dollars in credit lines active with the pipeline’s parent company. While no one was hurt in the protest, the climbing was risky. There is no supportive netting or cage under or around the ladder used to reach the catwalk on the truss, and the climbers risked a long fall. The stadium’s highest point is the 270-foot prow, which is on the western end of the building opposite the side the climbers used. Police said Sunday afternoon that they will meet with all stadium partners to investigate the incident and how the young men gained access to the stadium’s ceiling structure. NFL games are high-security events, and it’s unclear how the two protesters got in. All fans must pass through metal detectors to enter the building. Purses must be within strict size limits and/or be clear plastic. Everyone who enters the building is subject to a search at the entrance. Construction of the pipeline has been on hold for several weeks, the result of a yearlong battle between the petroleum industry and a coalition of American Indian tribes and environmentalists. The tribes and their supporters won a round last month, when federal officials put a hold on a final stretch of construction, but the expectation is President-elect Donald Trump will push the pipeline to completion. Star Tribune staff writer Paul Walsh contributed to this report. ||||| MINNEAPOLIS -- Protesters trying to stymie the Dakota Access oil pipeline sneaked up on a truss connected to the roof and rappelled down to unfurl a huge banner inside U.S. Bank Stadium during the Minnesota Vikings’ season finale against the Chicago Bears.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nations, including all of the great powers, organized into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Step 2: Perform research I will search for reliable information on the first attack of World War 2 to get a clear answer. Step 3: Analyze the information After finding the relevant information, I will carefully analyze and cross-check the data to make sure I have an accurate answer. The answer from the research: World War 2 is generally considered to have begun on September 1, 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany. Germany launched a surprise attack on Poland from multiple directions, employing a new type of warfare called \\"blitzkrieg,\\" which emphasized speed, coordination, and combined forces of air and ground units. This relatively swift invasion marked the beginning of the hostilities that would continue for six years.

Ferris frequently breaks the fourth wall, giving the audience advice on how to skip school, and to narrate about his friends. His younger sister Jeannie is less-convinced, but goes to school anyway. Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney notes and suspects Ferris is being truant again and commits to catching him. However, Ferris uses a computer to alter the school's records to indicate his absences from 9 to 2. Ferris convinces his friend Cameron Frye, who is absent due to illness, to report that his girlfriend Sloane Peterson's grandmother has died. Rooney doubts this, but they succeed as planned.

You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. and the situation: Noah is currently making dinner in his kitchen. He has been boiling some soup on the stove for a while, so the temperature of the soup is currently high. Noah's brother, Justin, is sitting on the couch in the living room. Justin is eating ice cream, which has a low temperature. Answer the following question: Do the particles have more kinetic energy in the ice cream or in the soup? Answer:","output":"The particles have more kinetic energy in the soup. Step 1: Identify the temperatures of the two substances being compared. In the situation provided, the soup is being boiled on the stove, so its temperature is high. On the other hand, the ice cream has a low temperature. Step 2: Recall the relationship between temperature and average kinetic energy of particles. From the background information, we know that when particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, and their temperature is higher. Conversely, when particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy and their temperature is lower. Step 3: Compare the kinetic energies of the particles in the two substances. Since the soup has a higher temperature and the ice cream has a lower temperature, we can conclude that the particles of matter in the soup are moving more quickly and have more kinetic energy. In contrast, the particles in the ice cream are moving more slowly and have less kinetic energy."},{"instruction":"Who is they referring to in the following sentence?

Two explanations are commonly given for this alteration. One deduces a false etymology associated with the word virgo (\\"maiden\\" in Latin) due to Virgil's excessive, \\"maiden\\"-like modesty. Alternatively, some argue that Vergilius was altered to Virgilius by analogy with the Latin virga (\\"wand\\") due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages (this explanation is found in only a handful of manuscripts, however, and was probably not widespread). In Norman schools (following the French practice), the habit was to anglicize Latin names by dropping their Latin endings, hence Virgil. In the 19th century, some German-trained classicists in the United States suggested modification to Vergil, as it is closer to his original name, and is also the traditional German spelling.[citation needed] Modern usage permits both, though the Oxford guide to style recommends Vergilius to avoid confusion with the 8th-century grammarian Virgilius Maro Grammaticus.

For this example, I will select the critically acclaimed film, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\". Step 2: Give a brief introduction to the movie The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.\\" Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman star as the two imprisoned protagonists, Andy Dufresne and Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding, respectively. Step 3: Summarize the plot (without spoilers) The plot of The Shawshank Redemption revolves around Andy Dufresne, a banker who is wrongfully accused and convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy strikes up an unlikely friendship with Red, a long-time inmate convicted of murder. The story follows their struggle to maintain a sense of hope and dignity within the oppressive confines of Shawshank while navigating the complex social structure of prison life. Step 4: Analyze the film's components (acting, cinematography, sound, etc.) The Shawshank Redemption delivers exceptional performances from its lead actors, particularly Robbins, who portrays Andy's quiet resilience and intelligence, and Freeman, who brings warmth and wisdom to the role of Red. Their on-screen chemistry feels tangible, forming the emotional core of the story. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is striking in its use of lighting and framing, capturing the bleak atmosphere of the prison and contrasting it with glimpses of beauty and moments of levity. These visual elements help convey the film's theme of finding hope in even the darkest circumstances. The film's sound design, coupled with Thomas Newman's evocative score, further enhances the storytelling, lending an emotional weight to key scenes while also highlighting the passage of time and the characters' inner turmoil.

In conclusion, while the specific form of \\"be\\" differs between the two sentences (as \\"be\\" in the first sentence and \\"was\\" in the second), the underlying meaning and purpose of the word are relatively similar in that they both serve as auxiliary verbs to create specific grammatical structures (future continuous tense and passive voice)."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Facts: - residence: canada - known for: ethereum , -lsb- http://bitcoinmagazine.com/ bitcoin magazine -rsb- - fields: digital theory , python -lrb- programming language -rrb- contracts , digital currencies , mathematics , game - awards: -lsb- http://www.thielfellowship.org/author/vitalikbuterin/ thiel fellowship -rsb- - birth date: 31/1/1994 - name: vitalik buterin - website: -lsb- http://about.me/vitalik_buterin about.me / vitalik_buterin -rsb- - birth place: russia - alma mater: university of waterloo -lrb- dropped out -rrb- Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of vitalik buterin .

A Chicago man convicted in the savage beating of a Northern Irish exchange student, which left her unable to walk or speak, was sentenced to 90 years in prison today. Minutes before Heriberto Viramontes learned his fate Thursday, a prosecutor displayed the bat used to assault exchange student Natasha McShane and her friend Stacy Jurich as they walked home on a spring evening. The 2010 attack left McShane with severe brain damage.

Her voice trembled with emotion as she recounted the heart-wrenching journey her family had taken since that tragic night when their lives changed forever. Irish native Natasha McShane, 23 years old at the time, had come to Chicago with dreams of advancing her academic career and pursuing new opportunities. She met her friend Stacy Jurich through the exchange program, and the two quickly formed a strong bond. Little did they know that their innocent decision to walk home together one fateful evening would lead to a nightmare that would haunt them for the rest of their lives. Prosecutors revealed the shocking details of the attack, showcasing the brutality and heartlessness of Heriberto Viramontes. The 37-year-old offender ambushed the two young women from behind and delivered merciless blows to their heads with a baseball bat. The sheer force of the impact left McShane and Jurich lying helplessly on the ground, their heads cracked open with pools of blood surrounding them. As McShane's family members broke down in tears and Jurich's family members comforted each other during the emotional court proceedings, it was clear that the trauma inflicted upon the victims would never be forgotten. While Stacy Jurich survived the assault with numerous injuries that required extensive rehabilitation, Natasha McShane suffered life-altering brain damage. She remains in a vegetative state to this day, incapable of walking, talking, or even recognizing her loved ones. In his closing arguments, Assistant State's Attorney John Maher described the horrific nature of the crime to the court and emphasized the need to hold Viramontes accountable for his actions. \\"Natasha McShane went from being a vibrant and intelligent young woman full of life to one who is completely dependent on others for her most basic needs,\\" Maher said passionately. \\"This heinous act of violence has left her in a living purgatory, and we must ensure that justice is served for her, her friend Stacy, and their families.\\" In delivering the 90-year sentence, Judge Jorge L. Alonso highlighted the unfathomable pain and suffering that Viramontes had caused his victims and their families. He expressed his hope that the lengthy sentence would serve as a strong deterrent to others, sending a clear message that violent acts of this nature would not be tolerated by society. As Viramontes was led away in handcuffs, the victims and their families embraced one another, their grief intertwined with relief that the man responsible for altering the course of their lives in such a devastating way would spend the rest of his days behind bars. While the sentencing brought a semblance of closure for the families, the long and arduous road to healing still lies ahead. The physical and emotional wounds inflicted upon Natasha McShane and Stacy Jurich may never fully heal, serving as painful reminders of the unimaginable cruelty that exists in the world. And for the McShane family, returning to their daughter's bedside each day, the heartache of losing the vibrant and thriving young woman they once knew will linger with them for the rest of their lives."},{"instruction":"Ford was born at the Swedish Covenant Hospital in Chicago, Illinois to Christopher Ford (born John William Ford), an advertising executive and former actor, and Dorothy (nee Nidelman), a former radio actress. His father is Irish and his mother is Jewish. A younger brother, Terence, was born in 1945. Ford's paternal grandparents, John Fitzgerald Ford and Florence Veronica Niehaus, were of Irish Catholic and German descent, respectively. In 1964, after a season of summer stock with the Belfry Players in Wisconsin, Ford traveled to Los Angeles to apply for a job in radio voice-overs. He did not get it, but stayed in California and eventually signed a 150-a-week contract with Columbia Pictures' New Talent program, playing bit roles in films. His first known role was an uncredited one as a bellhop in Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round (1966). There is little record of his non-speaking roles (or \\"extra\\" work) in film. Ford was at the bottom of the hiring list, having offended producer Jerry Tokovsky after he played a bellboy in the feature. He was told by Tokovsky that when actor Tony Curtis delivered a bag of groceries, he did it like a movie star; Ford felt his job was to act like a bellboy. Ford managed to secure other roles in movies, such as A Time for Killing (The Long Ride Home), starring Glenn Ford; George Hamilton; and Inger Stevens. His speaking roles continued next with Luv (1967), though he was still uncredited. He was finally credited as \\"Harrison J. Ford\\" in the 1967 Western film A Time for Killing, but the \\"J\\" did not stand for anything, since he has no middle name. It was added to avoid confusion with a silent film actor named Harrison Ford, who appeared in more than 80 films between 1915 and 1932 and died in 1957. Ford later said that he was unaware of the existence of the earlier actor until he came upon a star with his own name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ford soon dropped the \\"J\\" and worked for Universal Studios, playing minor roles in many television series throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Gunsmoke, Ironside, The Virginian, The F.B.I., Love, American Style, and Kung Fu. He appeared in the western Journey to Shiloh (1968) and had an uncredited, non-speaking role in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 film Zabriskie Point as an arrested student protester. Not happy with the roles being offered to him, Ford became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his then-wife and two young sons. Casting director and fledgling producer Fred Roos championed the young Ford and secured him an audition with George Lucas for the role of Bob Falfa, which Ford went on to play in American Graffiti (1973). Ford's relationship with Lucas would profoundly affect his career later on. After director Francis Ford Coppola's film The Godfather was a success, he hired Ford to expand his office and gave him small roles in his next two films, The Conversation (1974) and Apocalypse Now (1979); in the latter film he played an army officer named \\"G. Lucas\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Is there a specific film that got his career to take a turn for success?","output":"Yes, there is a specific film that got Harrison Ford's career to take a turn for success. Harrison Ford worked with George Lucas in the film \\"American Graffiti\\" (1973), which played a significant role in shaping his career later on."},{"instruction":"Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What's the full name of the man who suggested the Chili Peppers record in Houdini's former mansion? Now settled into Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers began looking for a suitable producer. One in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded than people the band had worked with in the past, even though Rubin had turned down the chance to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak (who would die of a heroin overdose a year later). Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone the band felt confident in to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.The band sought to record the album in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house in Los Angeles. The Peppers decided they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis, Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said \\"There are definitely ghosts in the house,\\" and Frusciante felt they were \\"very friendly. We [the band] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere we go in this house.\\"Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea each had their own rooms in the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large enough to accommodate the recording equipment. For more than 30 days, the Chili Peppers worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment...

In spite of a short-lived mainstream career spanning seven years, he was one of the most influential guitarists in the revival of blues in the 1980s. AllMusic describes him as \\"a rocking powerhouse of a guitarist who gave blues a burst of momentum in the '80s, with influence still felt long after his tragic death.\\" Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, Vaughan began playing guitar at the age of seven, inspired by his older brother Jimmie. Context: In May 1969, after leaving the Brooklyn Underground, Vaughan joined a band called the Southern Distributor. He had learned The Yardbirds' \\"Jeff's Boogie\\" and played the song at the audition. Mike Steinbach, the group's drummer, commented: \\"The kid was fourteen. We auditioned him on 'Jeff's Boogie,' really fast instrumental guitar, and he played it note for note.\\" Although they played pop rock covers, Vaughan conveyed his interest in the addition of blues songs to the group's repertoire; he was told that he wouldn't earn a living playing blues music and the band parted ways. Later that year, bassist Tommy Shannon walked into a Dallas club and heard Vaughan playing guitar. Fascinated by the skillful playing, which he described as \\"incredible even then\\", Shannon borrowed a bass guitar and the two jammed. Within a few years, they began performing together in a band called Krackerjack. In February 1970, Vaughan joined a band called Liberation, which was a nine-piece group with a horn section. Having spent the past month briefly playing bass with Jimmie in Texas Storm, he had originally auditioned as bassist. Impressed by Vaughan's guitar playing, Scott Phares, the group's original guitarist, modestly became the bassist. In mid-1970, they performed at the Adolphus Hotel in downtown Dallas, where ZZ Top asked them to perform. During Liberation's break, Vaughan jammed with ZZ Top on the Nightcaps song \\"Thunderbird\\". Phares later described the performance: \\"They tore the house down. It was awesome. It was one of those magical evenings. Stevie fit in like a glove on a hand.\\" Attending Justin F. Kimball High School during the early 1970s, Vaughan's late-night gigs contributed to his neglect in his studies, including music theory; he would often sleep during class. His musical career pursuit was disapproved by many of the school's administrators, but he was also encouraged by many people to strive for a career in art, including his art teacher. In his sophomore year, he attended an evening class for experimental art at Southern Methodist University, but bailed when it conflicted with rehearsal. Vaughan later spoke of his dislike of the school and stated that he had to receive a daily note from the principal about his grooming. Question: Was Vaughan interested in art? Answer:","output":"Yes, Vaughan was interested in art. He attended an evening class for experimental art at Southern Methodist University during his sophomore year at high school, and he was encouraged by people, including his art teacher, to strive for a career in art. However, he eventually left the art class due to conflicts with his rehearsal schedule."},{"instruction":"Write the last sentence in this story.

One reason is that eating these types of food reduces the risk of acid accumulation in your body. Raw and whole foods are usually digested more efficiently than cooked foods. When we cook foods, we destroy the natural enzymes that are part of the food in its raw form. These enzymes were intended by nature to help us digest the food. When we consume food without these natural enzymes, our bodies either digest the food improperly or allow too many nutrients to be absorbed into the bloodstream. In both instances, the result is overweight. When too many nutrients are absorbed at once, the body grows fat. Improperly digested food moves slowly through the digestive system, where it becomes increasingly acidic. To protect its vital organs from this acidic waste, the body changes the acid into fat and stores it safely away from the organs. Processed foods contain chemical elements, which might confuse the appetite mechanism that tells us when we've had enough to eat; as a result, people often overeat. Processed foods also upset the digestive cycle. The body will either identify these foods as allergens and then store them safely away from the organs as fat, or the remains of undigested food will become acidic and enter the bloodstream as acid waste, which will stick to the blood vessel walls and block the passage of vital oxygen and nutrients heading for the body's cells. The body's metabolism becomes inactive, and the result is weight gain and obesity. The accumulation of acid in the digestive system makes digestion increasingly inefficient. When that happens, even healthy foods can become acidic and the food allergies will become more common. To stop this vicious circle in its tracks, people need to consume food and supplements that will neutralize the acid already accumulated in body. Eating the right types of raw and whole foods can help. It's also important to restore your enzyme balance. You need to identify and avoid the foods that cause...

The GazeGroup has been developing eye-controlled computer technology for nearly 20 years. But those devices have been mainly designed to aid those with disabilities, and are very expensive. \\"After a while, we figured out that probably the best way is to go for a mass-market approach,\\" says Gaze's Sune Alstrup Johansen, \\"where everybody would have this available.\\" Johansen and some of his colleagues have formed a new company, The Eye Tribe, which is hoping to develop the technology on a mass commercial level. The technology works by sending an infrared light from the computing device toward the user's face. After measuring the user's eye movements, the technology is then able to easily know where a person's eyes are moving, allowing the eyes to control a cursor . A software can determine the location of the eyes and tell where the user is looking on the screen. It even knows which image he is looking at. There has been a gradual change toward hands-free technology in recent years, particularly in the gaming world. Following Nintendo's popular Wii system, Xbox released the Kinect device, which lets users control their Xbox and play certain games using only their hands, legs and voices. Since most smartphones and other mobile devices can't come standard with an infrared device, Johansen said a replaceable filter would be an inexpensive, convenient choice for most consumers. And even as companies like The Eye Tribe work to create a commercially practical product for the average user, making the eye-controlled technology more accessible and less expensive will have similar benefits for disabled users. \\"Then I can go to any computer, and then I can control it and I can use it, instead of just bringing my own,\\" said Stig Langvad, who heads up Denmark's umbrella organization for people with disabilities. \\"So I'll be a part of society on an equal foot, instead of...

She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. The whereabouts of McDaniel's Oscar are currently unknown. In 1992, Jet magazine reported that Howard University could not find it and alleged that it had disappeared during protests in the 1960s. In 1998, Howard University stated that it could find no written record of the Oscar having arrived at Howard. In 2007, an article in the Huffington Post repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The assertion reappeared in the Huffington Post under the same byline in 2009. In 2010, Mo'Nique, the winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the ceremony in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel \\"for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to\\". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s. In November 2011, W. B. Carter, of the George Washington University Law School, published the results of her year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Oscar's fate. Carter rejected claims that students had stolen the Oscar (and thrown it in the Potomac River) as wild speculation or fabrication that traded on long-perpetuated stereotypes of blacks. She questioned the sourcing of the Huffington Post stories. Instead, she argued that the Oscar was likely returned to Howard University's Channing Pollack Theater Collection between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1973 or had possibly been boxed and stored in the drama department at that time. The reason for its removal, she argued, was not civil rights unrest but rather efforts to make room for a new generation of black performers.

Sad to say, it's also the most lack-lustre and boring. Despite a terrific cast--Patricia Morrison, in particular, as the slinky villainess--the story plods along so slowly, with zero suspense, that you wonder how this quickie passed the approval of Universal executives. The plot revolves around music boxes but the plot has nothing to do with the title. On the cover of my budget Sherlock Holmes double-feature for 5.95, you see a great poster of Patricia Morrison, clad in furs and silks, with a gun ready to fire. And you get the impression that the movie has something to do with a sharply attired gun moll. I'm glad I only paid 5.95 for this episode in the usually entertaining HOlmes series. Oh, by the way, the second feature on my disc is \\"Terror in the Night,\\" another boring episode that has absolutely nothing to do with the title. Is the review positive or negative? The answer is:","output":"The review is negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment in the last Sherlock Holmes series for Universal, titled \\"Dressed to Kill,\\" describing it as lackluster and boring. They mention that despite a terrific cast, the story has no suspense and moves at a slow pace, making them question the decision of Universal executives to greenlight the project. Furthermore, the reviewer points out discrepancies between the movie's title and the actual plot, stating that the music box-related storyline doesn't match the movie's title. They also mention a misleading poster featuring Patricia Morrison, which gives the impression of an exciting movie with a sharply dressed gun moll, rather than the dull experience the reviewer had while watching the film. Additionally, the reviewer expresses relief for only having spent 5.95 on the double-feature, which includes another disappointing installment called \\"Terror in the Night.\\" Once again, they mention the incoherent connection between the title and the actual plot. Overall, the reviewer's dissatisfaction with both \\"Dressed to Kill\\" and \\"Terror in the Night\\" indicates a negative review, as they expected more from the usually entertaining Sherlock Holmes series."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation of fewer birds reproducing could have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Here's a step-by-step analysis of how this change may alter the process: 1. Fewer mating pairs: With fewer birds reproducing, there will be fewer mating pairs, which might lead to a reduction in genetic diversity. This can affect the resilience of their population to diseases and environmental changes. 2. Reduced number of eggs: As there are fewer mating pairs, the number of eggs laid will also decrease, leading to a decline in the overall population of the bird species. 3. Competition for resources and mates: With fewer birds reproducing, competition for resources such as food and nesting sites might decrease. This might increase the survival rate of newly hatched birds. However, it can also lead to reduced opportunities for mate selection, which can further impact the genetic diversity of the population. 4. Affected parental care: If the number of birds reproducing decreases significantly, the remaining birds might experience a change in parental care. They may need to adjust their behaviors and instincts to ensure the survival of the fewer offspring. 5. Development time: The decrease in competition for resources might lead to better conditions for the young birds to develop their flight feathers, potentially shortening the time it takes for them to become independent from their parents. 6. Teaching to fly: As resources are less scarce, the parent birds might have more time to effectively teach their offspring to fly, possibly increasing the success rate of the young birds when they eventually leave the nest. 7. Future breeding cycles: Since there are fewer birds to begin with, the population might take longer to recover and continue the breeding cycle. This can lead to long-term effects on the species' population size and growth rate. In conclusion, the perturbation of fewer birds reproducing can have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Some effects might seem beneficial, such as a decrease in competition for resources, but other effects, such as reduced genetic diversity and slower population recovery, could negatively impact the species."},{"instruction":"Enter the Shoguns: Japan's austere, ruthless, but statesmanlike new ruler, Yoritomo Minamoto, set up his government in Kamakura (just south of modern Tokyo), well away from the \\"softening\\" influence of court life that had been the undoing of his predecessor, Kiyomori. First of the national rulers to take the title of sei-i tai-shogun (\\"barbarian-subduing great general\\"), Minamoto expanded and consolidated his power by confiscating lands from some of the defeated Taira and redistributing them to his samurai vassals. Minamoto died in 1199, and the feudal structure passed intact to the tutelage of his widow's family, the Hojo, who were content to play regent to a figurehead shogun, in much the same way as the Fujiwara had done with the emperor. The fiction of Japanese imperial power had become infinitely extendable. The emperor at Kyoto — still seconded by a Fujiwara regent at court — legitimized a Minamoto who was himself a military dictator controlled by a Hojo regent. In a country where form and substance were inextricably interrelated, two things counted in politics: symbolic authority and real power. Neither could exist without the other. A thwarted Mongol invasion in 1274 weakened the Kamakura regime. The fighting brought none of the usual spoils of war that provincial warlords and samurai had come to expect as payment. And the treasury was empty after earthquake, famine, and plague had crippled the economy. Buddhist monasteries were using their private armies to support imperial ambitions to bring power back to Kyoto. Worst of all, the Kamakura warriors, resenting the way the Kyoto court referred to them as \\"Eastern barbarians,\\" sought refinement in a ruinous taste for luxury: extravagant feasts, rich costumes, and opulent homes. Kamakura was falling apart. Question: \\"How did Minamoto expand his power?\\" Answer: \\"By invading other territories\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, this answer is not accurate. A more accurate answer would be: Yoritomo Minamoto expanded and consolidated his power by confiscating lands from the defeated Taira and redistributing them to his samurai vassals, thus ensuring their loyalty and support. This action strengthened his control over Japan and helped solidify his position as the first sei-i tai-shogun."},{"instruction":"Write a question about the following article: Coming off their divisional win over the Browns, the Steelers stayed at home for a Week 7 interconference duel with the 6-0 Minnesota Vikings.

It takes a lot to earn a 4.5/5 star average on yelp and it made me wonder, it made me ponder and it made me eager to visit immediately to see what all this burger hype was about. While planning an office hours at Lobby's, I spoke to Lobby several times and listened to him explain the attention he gives to his burgers. The incredibly lean meat, the personal attention to each patty, Lobby's commitment to making the patty's from scratch...it sounded like this was a business that was definitely handled with some tender loving care. So the day arrived for me to finally visit Lobby's. The directions indicated that it was in a strip mall. For those of you who might get a little turned around like I do...go towards the grocery store and when you're facing it look to the left and behind you and poof, there's Lobby's! So I walked in and received a friendly welcome from the staff the second my foot entered the store. As I sat there for several hours, I noticed that Lobby and staff treat every customer the same way and each customer gets a personal welcome upon arrival. I also like how they welcome but they don't banter the potential customers to try the food. They let the customer decide for themselves. The decor was retro and cool and I could see the burger and fries being made right in front of me. I glanced at the menu even though I knew that only a burger this visit would do, and I was pleased with the price. Inexpensive. Moving on to the grand finale, the food. I ordered the cheeseburger and upon the staffer's recommendation, I got it with provolone and kept everything on it, especially Lobby's special sauce. The staffer suggested I take some special sauce on the side for my fries and swore by it so I didn't question the man and said OK! The burger and fries arrived and I immediately knew I was in trouble... the gluttony kind. Nestled on a fresh sesame bun and topped with thick and juicy pickles, lettuce, tomato and the special sauce, the patty was cooked to perfection and just the right size. I took one bite and was in cheeseburger paradise and I didn't even have to go to Hawaii! The burger was juicy, full of taste and the meat was lean. The special sauce. Oh my the special sauce. It's not your typical special burger sauce. There was an ingredient in there that made it just the right amount of sweet and perfect for dipping fries. I guess the lesson here is trust the Lobby's staffer! I tried to guess what the ingredients in the special sauce were but Lobby said that nobody has ever been able to guess. So that's a challenge yelpers. Figure out what's in the special sauce and let me know! The fries were crunchy and delicious, but there were a lot of them so if you go with a friend, you might want to share the fries since the burger will fill you up. I can't wait to visit Lobby's again and try the Italian Beef sandwich Donald S was raving about. If it's anything like the burger, I know I'll be in heaven. But in the meantime, I'll just have burgerlicious dreams about the tastiness I experienced with Lobby's Burgers. And now I see why they have such a high rating on yelp. Bravo Lobby!

Several small earthquakes, beginning on March 15, indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano. On March 20, at 3:45 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake centered below the volcano's north flank, signaled the volcano's violent return from 123 years of hibernation. A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale. A total of 174 shocks of magnitude 2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days. Shocks of magnitude 3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude 4 or above per day in early April, and eight per day the week before May 18. Initially there was no direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations. At 12:36 p.m. on March 27, phreatic eruptions (explosions of steam caused by magma suddenly heating groundwater) ejected and smashed rock from within the old summit crater, excavating a new crater 250 feet (75 m) wide, and sending an ash column about 7,000 feet (2.1 km) into the air. By this date a 16,000-foot-long (3.0 mi; 4.9 km) eastward-trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area.

This domestic haven, filled with nostalgic possessions and a kaleidoscope of cherished memories etched into every corner, every object, and every seen and unseen aspect, nurtures a strong sense of belonging and affection, forcing the heart to leave a piece of its own whenever one departs, it pulls with an invisible string, promising an incessant longing for return, for home is where the heart truly resides, irrespective of where one may wander.

With a military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan and its associated collateral damage Shirley Williams maintains this increases resentment and terrorist threats against the West. There is also perceived U.S. hypocrisy, media-induced hysteria, and that differences in foreign and security policy have damaged America's image in most of the world. Q: What fed US hysteria about terrorism?","output":"To answer the question on what fed US hysteria about terrorism, let's analyze the given information and other factors step by step: 1. Perception of a significant threat: The attacks on September 11, 2001, made the United States acutely aware of the threat terrorism posed, creating a sense of vulnerability and urgency to respond to this threat. 2. Media amplification: The media played a critical role in raising public awareness of terrorism as a significant issue. By continuously reporting on terrorist incidents and threats, the media contributed to the sense of fear and anxiety surrounding terrorism. 3. Political rhetoric: Politicians, particularly in the Bush administration, used strong rhetoric to emphasize the danger of terrorism and the need for strong national security measures. This framing of the issue helped to sustain public fear and hysteria. 4. Policies focused on the \\"War on Terror\\": The US government launched the \\"War on Terror\\" as a policy response to terrorism following 9/11. This included military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, which served to maintain a focus on terrorism as a central concern of US foreign policy. 5. Ineffective communication: The lack of clear and consistent communication about the nature of the terrorist threat and the objectives of the \\"War on Terror\\" contributed to confusion and suspicion among the American public. 6. Cultural factors: Emotional reactions to events like terrorist attacks can be amplified by cultural factors, such as a sense of collective victimhood, national pride, and a desire to protect one's own community. This can contribute to heightened perceptions of threat and hysteria. In conclusion, the US hysteria about terrorism was fed by a combination of factors, including perception of a significant threat, media amplification, political rhetoric, policies focused on the \\"War on Terror,\\" ineffective communication, and cultural factors."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Thomas Dellert Dellacroix - Thomas Dellert-Bergh also known as Thomas Dellacroix and Tommy Dollar (born 12 July 1953) is a Swedish multimedia artist painter actor singer songwriter poet film maker director photographer theater costume designer and set designer.As a contemporary visual artist he has had over 100 International exhibitions during the last 30 years.

Article: Have you ever had the strange feeling that you were being watched? You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you! Parapsychologists say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a \\"sixth sense\\" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments. In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them. For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed. Baker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they're being stared at.

As a diagnostic tool, MRIs are widely used in the medical field to obtain detailed images of internal body structures without resorting to invasive procedures. The MRI machine's ability to generate these images is based on the principles of electromagnetism, specifically the interaction between a static magnetic field and radio frequency (RF) pulses. An MRI machine includes a large and powerful magnet that generates a strong, constant magnetic field, typically ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 Tesla. This magnetic field is several thousand times stronger than Earth's magnetic field, causing the protons within the body's water molecules to align with the direction of the applied magnetic field. At this point, the MRI's RF pulses come into play. The radio frequency pulses, which are also non-contact forces, are transmitted by the MRI scanner and applied to the body by the use of a coil. These RF pulses momentarily disturb the alignment of the protons by transferring energy to them. When the RF pulse is switched off, the protons then release this energy as they return to their original alignment, resulting in the creation of echoes or emitted signals. The MRI machine is equipped with gradient coils that generate a separate magnetic field capable of varying its strength in a controlled and precise manner. These gradient magnetic fields, which are also responsible for the spatial encoding of the signals, make it possible to construct a detailed and three-dimensional image of the body part being examined. The signals that the protons emit are subsequently detected by receiver coils, which then send the data to a computer system responsible for processing the multitudes of signals and converting them into the high-resolution MRI images that we see. The remarkable aspect of this entire process is that the MRI machine never actually comes into direct contact with the patient's body. The magnetic fields and RF pulses exert their influence on the protons within the patient's body by using the principles of electromagnetism without any physical intervention. This distinctive feature makes MRI a non-invasive and safe diagnostic technique with a minimal risk of complications. In conclusion, MRIs can make use of non-contact forces, such as the magnetic fields and radio frequency pulses, to generate detailed and precise imagery of the body's internal structures without any direct contact with the patient. The advanced technology employed in MRI machines is a testament to its incredible impact on medical diagnostics. Furthermore, the utilization of electromagnetism in MRI demonstrates the immense potential of non-contact forces in an array of disciplines beyond healthcare."},{"instruction":"Carol Hernandez is an American journalist from Miami Florida.

I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover.

Examples of this include untreated sewage, wastewater from a sewage treatment plant, and leaking underground tanks. Q: What type of pollution results from the contaminants that enter a waterway or water body through a single site? A: The answer is:","output":"Point source pollution is the type of pollution that results from contaminants entering a waterway or water body through a single site. This form of pollution can be traced back to a specific location or source, making it relatively easier to identify, monitor, and manage compared to nonpoint source pollution which originates from diffuse sources. Common examples of point source pollution include untreated sewage, wastewater discharge from sewage treatment plants, industrial waste discharge, and leaking underground storage tanks. When contaminants from point source pollution enter water bodies, they can have significant and long-lasting impacts on the quality of water and its surrounding ecosystems. The pollutants can directly harm aquatic life, leading to the decline of fish populations, the disruption of food chains, habitat degradation, and possible extinction of certain species. Additionally, these pollutants can harm water quality by introducing toxic substances, increasing nutrient levels, and altering the balance of dissolved oxygen in the water. Since point source pollution can be traced back to a specific location, it becomes possible to monitor and regulate the release of pollutants through various regulations and permits, such as the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program in the United States. Under the Clean Water Act, facilities that discharge pollutants into waterways must obtain a permit which sets limits on the amount of pollutants that can be released and requires ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance. This system helps to prevent and mitigate potential damage caused by point source pollution. To further address point source pollution, it is critical for governments, industries, and communities to work together to implement best management practices (BMPs). BMPs are designed to reduce the amount of pollutants being discharged into water bodies and can include measures such as upgrading wastewater treatment plants, installing effective pollution-control technologies, properly maintaining and monitoring underground storage tanks, and implementing environmentally friendly practices in industrial settings. In conclusion, point source pollution is the type of pollution that results from contaminants entering a waterway or water body through a single, identifiable source. The negative impacts of this pollution on water quality and ecosystems can be significant, but with appropriate monitoring, regulation, and best management practices, it is possible to mitigate the harmful effects and protect the health of our water resources."},{"instruction":"Question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What place protects animals such as the bald eagle?

After a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here. Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as \\"falling within a difficult period\\" and Waters found them \\"tortuous\\". Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: \\"Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.\\"While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio. Thorgerson recalled that he \\"sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there\\". He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth. Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US. Answer:","output":"Waters"},{"instruction":"What would you put on your foot first before anything else?

Table: A table is a piece of furniture typically used for activities such as eating, working, or studying. It is not something you should put on your foot. 5.

Sentence 2: No one cared about what Bush did. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's analyze both sentences step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the main points in both sentences. Sentence 1: - Nobody was asking Gary Bauer such questions that day (except perhaps for pointed contrast) - The obvious hook for these questions is Bush's alleged hypocrisy Sentence 2: - No one cared about what Bush did Step 2: Check for logical connections between the main points. The main point of Sentence 1 suggests that the questions were not being asked to Gary Bauer because the focus was on Bush's alleged hypocrisy. However, Sentence 2 states that no one cared about what Bush did. Step 3: Assess if there's a relationship between the main points. While Sentence 1 discusses the lack of questions directed towards Gary Bauer, it implies that there is indeed some focus on Bush's actions. Sentence 2 asserts that no one cared about Bush's actions, which is contradictory to the implication in Sentence 1 that Bush's alleged hypocrisy is a topic of interest. Conclusion: No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. While both sentences discuss the focus on Bush, they present contrasting ideas about the level of attention or concern given to his actions."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Hello, little friends! Today, we're going to talk about someone who made an amazing catch during a football game. Do you know what a catch is in football? It's when a player grabs the ball out of the air while it's being thrown to them – pretty cool, right? Well, someone caught an extra-long pass that went for 52 yards! That's longer than half a football field! Can you believe it? Now, who was the person who caught this super-duper-long pass? Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to tell you the name of that player. Grown-ups usually mention the name of the player, the team they play for, and the game in which the long pass happened. But still, think about how amazing this person must be to catch a 52-yard pass! It takes lots of practice, strength, and focus to run very fast and catch a ball flying through the air! In football, there are many talented players who practice hard every day to make catches like this in important games. The person who catches the ball is usually called a \\"wide receiver.\\" Some players are famous for making incredible catches just like this 52-yard pass! So, even if we don't know the name of this particular football hero, let's imagine them running super fast, jumping into the air, and catching the ball with their hands like a superhero! And remember, it's always fun to watch and learn more about football and other sports. Maybe you'll even get to see someone catch a 52-yard pass while watching a game someday!"},{"instruction":"– Rod Blagojevich got some news today that sounds great on the surface: A judge overturned five of the more \\"sensational\\" corruption convictions against the former Illinois governor and ordered him to be resentenced, reports AP. But as the Chicago Tribune notes, it may not ultimately affect his 14-year sentence, and he's not getting out in the interim. The federal appeals court called the evidence against Blagojevich \\"overwhelming\\"—the other 13 convictions against him stand—and suggested the original sentence was not at all too harsh. However, the court found that jurors got improper instructions on five counts connected to his proposed deal with the White House: In exchange for a Cabinet post, he'd appoint Obama aide Valerie Jarrett to the president's vacated Senate seat, reports the Chicago Sun-Times. Prosecutors could appeal, seek to retry Blagojevich on the five counts, or let Blagojevich go back before the original judge for resentencing. The appeals court didn't sound sympathetic to Blagojevich, but because the five counts may have had some effect on the total sentence, it says the judge must take another look. “It is not possible to call 168 months unlawfully high for Blagojevich’s crimes, but the district judge should consider on remand whether it is the most appropriate sentence,” says today's opinion. Blagojevich's brother, Robert, said he was \\"cautiously optimistic\\" about the news. “I’m hopeful that this will lead to a long overdue, positive outcome for my brother. Justice is long overdue.

The green-fingered pair, who taught themselves gardening, spent years and £15,000 working on their Walsall garden, using a vast array of plants and flowers to create a place bursting with colour. Mr and Mrs Newton have grown around 3,000 different species of plant including 140 Japanese maple trees, 20 golden kings, 15 juniper blue stars and two huge Virginia creepers. Scroll down for video. The Newtons, both aged 65, working in the spectacular Walsall garden he and his wife have spent years and £15,000 transforming using a vast array of different plant and flowers. The garden now boasts around 3,000 different species of plant including 140 Japanese maple trees, 20 golden kings, 15 juniper blue stars and two huge Virginia creepers. The couple are again opening their garden up to the public later this month as part of the National Gardens Scheme, with proceeds going to various cancer charities. Mrs Newton said: 'It's good to put Walsall and the West Midlands on the international garden map. We have derived immense pleasure from doing this huge project together without outside help.' Mrs Newton created the amazing garden, which this year benefited from one of the warmest Septembers on record, after retiring from her job as a transport planner and taught herself horticulture. She explained: 'It's good to put Walsall and the West Midlands on the international garden map. We have derived immense pleasure from doing this huge project together without outside help. 'It has been very satisfying to use so many skills, and to have done every task ourselves. 'All but two of all the plants in our garden have been planted by us.' Mrs Newton explained: 'It has been very satisfying to use so many skills, and to have done every task ourselves. All but two of all the plants in our garden have been planted by us.'

We are just as keen as ever.' Mrs Newton said: 'It's an autumn garden so people can expect brilliant reds, oranges and yellows. There will be azalea and acer leaves along with the evergreen conifers.' Mr Newton said: 'You have got all these colours now. It's amazing this year.

Now the couple, who have four grown-up children and one granddaughter, are opening their garden up to the public later this month as part of the National Gardens Scheme. Their garden has already raised more than £34,000 for the scheme and welcomed 10,700 visitors since 2006. Proceeds from the scheme go to charities Marie Curie Cancer Care and Macmillan Cancer Support. Thanks to the hard work of Mr and Mrs Newton, the garden has been transformed from how it looked in 1985, and has been visited by people from 28 different countries. This photo from 1992 shows how the garden started to change over the years with new flowers and trees, but it still some way short from how it looks today.

My son Alexander and I arrived home on Wednesday evening ( Apr 26 ) to see a blue jay trying to grab branches from the plum tree in our front yard . The jay ( I assumed it was a he ) tried unsuccessfully a number of times and then started a call deeper than the regular call . His mate joined him . Why would the blue jay be out in front of the home ?","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, it seems like the blue jay was out in front of the home due to its interest in the branches from the plum tree in the front yard. There are a few possible reasons for the blue jay's behavior, which I will explain in detail below: 1. Nest-building: One potential explanation for the blue jay's presence in front of the house is that it was collecting branches to build a nest. Blue jays are known for their nest-building skills, and they typically require small branches, twigs, and other materials to construct their nests. It's possible that the blue jay was attempting to gather branches from the plum tree in the front yard for this purpose. Moreover, the article mentions that the jay's mate joined him, which further supports the idea that they were engaged in nest-building activities together. 2. Food search: Another possibility is that the blue jay was searching for food. Blue jays are omnivorous birds, meaning they eat a variety of foods, including fruit, insects, and small animals. It's possible that there might be insects, fruit, or other food sources on the branches of the plum tree that attracted the blue jay and its mate. 3. Territorial behavior: Blue jays are known to be quite territorial and will sometimes engage in aggressive behavior to protect their territory. The presence of the plum tree in the front yard might have attracted the blue jay and its mate, as it could potentially serve as a suitable nesting site, or provide them with access to food sources. In response to the perceived encroachment into their territory, the blue jay might have been exhibiting territorial behavior and attempting to defend the area around the tree. 4. Social interaction: Finally, it's worth noting that blue jays are social birds, capable of complex vocalizations, and known for mating couple interaction. The deeper calls the blue jay made might have been a form of communication between the two partners. Perhaps they were interacting and cooperating over the task of collecting branches, vocalizing to share information, or signaling for each other to synchronize their activities. In conclusion, the blue jay could have been out in front of the home due to a variety of factors, including nest-building, searching for food, territorial behavior, or social interaction with its mate. The specific details provided (such as the attempted gathering of branches and the presence of its mate) point towards a combination of nest-building and social interaction as the two most likely reasons for the blue jay's presence in front of the house."},{"instruction":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Available choices: (i). relief to accomplish his objective; (ii). angst over how to complete the task; (iii). result-oriented; The answer is:","output":"To determine how Austin would feel after reinventing the wheel as an innovative way to accomplish his goal, let's analyze each available choice: Step 1: Analyze choice (i) - relief to accomplish his objective - Given that Austin has found a solution to accomplish his goal (reinventing the wheel), it is possible that he would feel relief for overcoming the challenge. Step 2: Analyze choice (ii) - angst over how to complete the task - This choice does not seem relevant since Austin has already found a solution (reinventing the wheel) and is no longer struggling to complete the task. Step 3: Analyze choice (iii) - result-oriented - Being result-oriented is a characteristic trait rather than a feeling. However, Austin's action (reinventing the wheel) might be indicative of a result-oriented mindset, focusing on the end goal.

Somehow, Tasha and I began to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can imagine. She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert.

Bananas are known to have nutrients and vitamins that can nourish and moisturize the hair. Now, let's consider the potential solutions: Solution A: 1. Peel one or two ripe bananas. 2. Mash the bananas until a smooth paste is formed. 3. Apply the banana paste to damp hair, ensuring that it is evenly distributed. 4. Cover hair with a shower cap and let the mixture sit for 15-30 minutes. 5. Rinse the hair thoroughly with water and shampoo to remove the banana paste. 6. Condition and style the hair as usual. Solution B: 1. Place banana peels directly on the hair and rub the insides of the peels along the strands. 2. Leave the banana peels on the hair for a couple of minutes. 3. Remove the banana peels and wash the hair with a mild shampoo. 4. Condition and style the hair as usual. In terms of naive physics reasoning, the more sound solution would be Solution A for the following justifications: 1. Mashing the bananas into a smooth paste (Solution A) would maximize the contact between the hair and banana nutrients, leading to better absorption and treatment of dry or damaged hair. In contrast, rubbing the insides of banana peels (Solution B) might not release enough nutrients and be less effective. 2. In Solution A, covering the hair with a shower cap and leaving the mixture on for an extended period (15-30 minutes) allows the nutrients to penetrate the hair shaft more effectively, thus treating the dry or damaged hair. In Solution B, leaving the peels on for just a few minutes may not provide enough time for the nutrients to make a significant impact. 3. Solution A uses one or two ripe bananas that are rich in nutrients, while Solution B only utilizes the peels, which may not contain as many beneficial nutrients for the hair. Therefore, using ripe bananas provides more nourishment. In conclusion, Solution A seems to be more sound due to the better absorption of nutrients, higher nutrient content, and effective exposure time."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a short story with a beginning, two potential middles, and an ending.

Considered the \\"father of tubular designs\\" for high-rises, Khan was also a pioneer in computer-aided design (CAD). He was the designer of the Sears Tower, since renamed Willis Tower, the tallest building in the world from 1973 until 1998, and the 100-story John Hancock Center. Khan, more than any other individual, ushered in a renaissance in skyscraper construction during the second half of the 20th century. Khan's central innovation in skyscraper design and construction was the idea of the \\"tube\\" structural system for tall buildings, including the framed tube, trussed tube, and bundled tube variants. His \\"tube concept\\", using all the exterior wall perimeter structure of a building to simulate a thin-walled tube, revolutionized tall building design. Most buildings over 40 stories constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan's structural engineering principles. Lateral loads (horizontal forces) such as wind forces, seismic forces, etc., begin to dominate the structural system and take on increasing importance in the overall building system as the building height increases. Wind forces become very substantial, and forces caused by earthquakes, etc. are important as well. The tubular designs resist such forces for tall buildings. Tube structures are stiff and have significant advantages over other framing systems. They not only make the buildings structurally stronger and more efficient, but also significantly reduce the structural material requirements. The reduction of material makes the buildings economically more efficient and reduces environmental impact. The tubular designs enable buildings to reach even greater heights. Tubular systems allow greater interior space and further enable buildings to take on various shapes, offering added freedom to architects. These new designs opened an economic door for contractors, engineers, architects, and investors, providing vast amounts of real estate space on minimal plots of land. Khan was among a group of engineers who encouraged a rebirth in skyscraper construction after a hiatus of over thirty years. The tubular systems have yet to reach their limit when it comes to height. Another important feature of the tubular systems is that buildings can be constructed using steel or reinforced concrete, or a composite of the two, to reach greater heights. Khan pioneered the use of lightweight concrete for high-rise buildings, at a time when reinforced concrete was used for mostly low-rise construction of only a few stories in height. Most of Khan's designs were conceived considering pre-fabrication and repetition of components so projects could be quickly built with minimal errors. The population explosion, starting with the baby boom of the 1950s, created widespread concern about the amount of available living space, which Khan solved by building upward. More than any other 20th-century engineer, Fazlur Rahman Khan made it possible for people to live and work in \\"cities in the sky.\\" Mark Sarkisian (Director of Structural and Seismic Engineering at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill) said, \\"Khan was a visionary who transformed skyscrapers into sky cities while staying firmly grounded in the fundamentals of engineering.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Does this system help when the building collapse?","output":"The above article does not specifically address whether the tubular system helps during a building collapse. However, it does emphasize the increased structural strength and efficiency provided by Fazlur Rahman Khan's tube concept. The tube structural system, including the framed tube, trussed tube, and bundled tube variants, significantly enhances a building's resistance to lateral loads such as wind and seismic forces, which are crucial factors in maintaining the stability of tall buildings. These innovations not only make the buildings stronger and more efficient but also reduce the required structural materials, making the structures more sustainable and economically efficient. While the article does not directly discuss the impact of the tubular system on a building collapse, it can be inferred that the enhanced structural strength and resistance to lateral forces provided by the tubular design would contribute to a building's overall resilience and safety. In the event of a potential collapse, a more robust and well-engineered structural system might help mitigate damage and possibly save lives. Nonetheless, it is essential to conduct thorough analyses and follow stringent building codes and safety regulations in any skyscraper construction to ensure the safety of its occupants and minimize the risk of building collapse."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

A pocketwatch A:","output":"Title: The Ballad of the Crimson Pocketwatch In a small, strife-ridden border town in late 19th-century Mexico, there exists a legend of a cold-hearted killer named El Indio, notorious for his dueling prowess and cruel tactics. Few have seen El Indio in person and lived to tell the tale, except those who have heard the haunting melody that always precedes his deadly duels – a melody that emerges from an ornate crimson pocketwatch. One day, a mysterious young woman named Isabella arrives in the town, seemingly determined to settle an old score. She is seeking El Indio, the killer of her father who was once a skilled gunfighter himself. Driven by a burning desire for revenge, she begins her search for the enigmatic duelist and the crimson pocketwatch. As Isabella delves further into the town's secrets, she learns more about the past of El Indio and the crimson pocketwatch. The pocketwatch once belonged to a powerful shaman who imbued it with ancient magic to control time. When the shaman passed away, his descendants safeguarded the pocketwatch until it fell into the hands of El Indio. The pocketwatch not only serves as El Indio's morbid orchestra but also has the power to slow down time, giving him a significant advantage in duels. Unable to best El Indio with her own skills, Isabella seeks guidance from a blind, old apothecary who once studied under the same shaman that created the pocketwatch. Through a series of intense challenges and long-forgotten rituals, Isabella starts to awaken her innate magical abilities. At the same time, she forms an unexpected bond with a charismatic and morally complex outlaw, Pedro, who has his own reasons for wanting to see El Indio vanquished. Eventually, El Indio catches wind of Isabella's pursuit and confronts her in a tense standoff. With her newfound powers and Pedro's support, Isabella manages to shatter the crimson pocketwatch and neutralize El Indio's devious advantage. The shocking truth about Pedro's connection to El Indio and the shaman lineage is finally revealed, adding layers of emotional weight to their battle. Now on equal footing, the fabled gunslingers engage in a breathtaking, climactic duel to finally put an end to the legend of the crimson pocketwatch. Through sheer grit and determination, Isabella overcomes her fears and emerges victoriously, avenging her father's death and breaking the terrible spell that once haunted the town."},{"instruction":"If \\"A boy appears to be dancing to music in a building filled with people.\\", can we conclude \\"some people dance for a boy\\"?","output":"Based on the given statement, \\"A boy appears to be dancing to music in a building filled with people,\\" we cannot definitively conclude that \\"some people dance for a boy.\\" The original statement only provides information about the boy's actions and the presence of other people in the building.

The base of the triangle is barely there. At the apex is Marie, a serious, short and lean tomboy with a Belmondo-like facial structure. Her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite: coquette, chubby -- I dare say fat -- and desirous for her first kiss with a boy but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter. Because of her chubbiness, boys don't seem interested and it pains her. The other leg of the apex is a beautiful \\"fille fatale\\" blonde vamp. She is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming performing at competitive level. Marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool. Marie insinuates herself into the life of the vamp using the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument. The vamp has a reputation of being a whore, making out with any young male that orbits around her. Marie is not phased out by that reputation. Put a stress on reputation. The first half is set up. We get to see a lot of synchronized swimming as we become familiar with the three girls.

The decor in the lounge is absolutely stunning and immediately puts you in a loungey, relaxy mood as you take a seat. This place is what I feel a true hookah lounge embodies. All the other ones I've been to around here and Cali have nothing on this lounge. With that said, the one on Maryland Pkwy is the same, just smaller and more narrow in size.

Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\" The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\" should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and..., can you guess it ?

As independent contractors, Uber drivers' ability to make money comes from the amount of work they're able to secure during a shift. Making your driver wait undermines their ability to earn their wage and may make them more reluctant to give you a 5-star rating. Limit the amount of time you make your driver wait by being ready to hop in the car as soon as they arrive at your location. Try to gather your belongings before requesting the Uber. When Uber sends you a notification that your driver is approaching, make your way to the pickup location (assuming that the location is the street outside of your address - if it's farther away than this, plan accordingly so that you can be there as soon as your driver arrives). Some Uber drivers work shifts of up to 19 hours at a time. Remember that any job comes with stresses that can be intense, and that your driver will appreciate you treating them with kindness and consideration even if they're working more manageable schedules than this. Practice patience with your driver by keeping in mind that they're doing their best to get you to your destination as quickly and as comfortably as possible. If you have concerns with your driver's quality of service, try to bring them up non-confrontationally, or wait until the end of your journey to report them to Uber instead of bringing them up directly. Uber allows you to tip through the app, but you can give your driver a cash tip if you'd like. Consider carrying cash during your Uber rides to give your driver after pleasant service, and they will likely reciprocate by giving you a high star rating. Think of it as a \\"five-for-five\\" deal. Uber drivers offer up a valuable asset of their private property to service rides to customers. Remember that an Uber driver's car is different from a train or bus in this sense, and the person who uses the vehicle the most is the same person who has to maintain it. When riding in an Uber car, adopt a \\"leave no trace\\" policy whereby you commit to leaving the car in as good of a state as it was in when you entered it. Don't leave food wrappers or drink bottles behind in your car. Be mindful of mess on your clothing or shoes and be conscientious about getting any dirt you track into an Uber out when you leave it. If your Uber has leather seats, ask your driver if they are comfortable with you putting your personal belonging on it before placing them there. Drunk and intoxicated customers can make for a very stressful experience for your driver, who may feel anxious about their passenger's potential belligerence or sickness. Remember that your driver's car is their personal space, and exercise whatever restraint you're able to in the car after a night out. If you fear you may fall ill in the car, let your driver know; they'll appreciate you giving them the opportunity to pull over and allow you to be sick somewhere that won't damage their car.","output":"Be ready when your Uber driver arrives, treat them kindly, keep their car clean, and consider tipping them to help them earn money and improve your rating."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: Premise: \\"A man in a blue shirt getting ready to put a cracker in his soup.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A man is eating pizza.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. After reading the above, is \\"Two years after Parasekwana took the money to Beijing\\" the correct answer to the question \\"In what year did the Chinese inhabit Melaka?\\"?","output":"From the provided information, it is clear that in 1409 the Chinese fleet, led by Admiral Cheng Ho, arrived in Melaka, and in 1411 Parameswara took the annual tribute to Beijing. Therefore, \\"Two years after Parameskwana took the money to Beijing\\" would be 1413. However, the text does not explicitly state that the Chinese inhabited Melaka in 1413. It mentions the Chinese linked to Melaka in the context of trade and protection but doesn't explicitly define a year when the Chinese settled in Melaka. So, we cannot conclusively say that \\"Two years after Parameskwana took the money to Beijing\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"In what year did the Chinese inhabit Melaka?\\"."},{"instruction":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","output":"Step 1: Choose a topic for the question I'll choose the topic of geography, as it provides a broad range of factual questions.

Given these facts, what do trees have that insulates among the following options: - hats - looseness - dogs - woody stems - food and shelter - cells - storing water - In their leaves A:","output":"Among the given options, trees have woody stems as their insulating feature. The woody stems are covered with bark, which provides a protective layer against various external factors, including fire damage. In mature trees, the bark can be 6 to 12 inches thick, offering a substantial layer of insulation to keep the tree safe from external threats. This attribute of trees is essential for their survival and growth in various environmental conditions. Additionally, the bark serves multiple purposes beyond providing insulation. It also protects the tree from pests, diseases, and harsh weather conditions. The woody stems and bark together form a resilient structure that aids in water and nutrient transportation, ensuring the overall health and well-being of the tree. Moreover, the bark's thickness can vary depending on the species, age, and location, further indicating the diversity amongst trees and their adaptive capabilities. Although the other options may not directly contribute to insulation against fire damage, some of them have indirect roles in the tree's general protection and survival strategy. For instance, tree leaves play a critical role in photosynthesis, which is essential for the tree's growth and overall health. Storing water may help increase the tree's resistance to drought or heat stress. Nevertheless, when considering the options provided, woody stems and the bark that covers them are the primary insulating features that protect trees from fire damage and various other environmental pressures.

The Giants were like superheroes, always trying hard and never giving up. Everyone cheered and clapped when the Giants won, and we should all be very proud of them. When a team wins big like that, we call it a triumph. Now, let's talk about the almost perfect game. In baseball, there's something called a perfect game. It's when a pitcher, who throws the ball to the other team, does such a good job that he never lets the other team get any points. A perfect game is very, very hard to do because the other team always wants to get those points too. This year, we had a game that was almost perfect, but not quite. The pitcher tried his best and almost made it happen, but the other team managed to score one point. Even though it wasn't perfect, it was still an amazing game to watch. When a game gets this close to being perfect, people talk about it a lot, and it becomes a big story in the world of baseball. So, kids, this year we had two very exciting things happen in baseball: the Giants won big, and we got to see an almost perfect game.

Indigenous Australians have lived in parts of the Northern Territory for around 40,000 years. Pre-European settlement numbers are not known with any precision, although the Indigenous population of the Northern Territory has been estimated at \\"well over 10,000\\". The area now known as Muckaty Station (often referred to as just \\"Muckaty\\", though the origin of this name and near variants such as \\"Mucketty\\" is unknown) was – and is – the responsibility of seven clans of traditional Indigenous owners: Milwayi, Ngapa, Ngarrka, Wirntiku, Kurrakurraja, Walanypirri and Yapayapa. The country is known by the Indigenous name Warlmanpa, which is also the name of a local language.Although there had been several unsuccessful attempts by British or colonial authorities to settle in the Northern Territory, there was no permanent European presence until surveyor George Goyder in 1869 established what is now known as Darwin. The timing was auspicious: in October 1870 the South Australian government decided to construct an overland telegraph line, from Port Augusta on the continent's south coast, to the new settlement just established in the country's tropical north. The line traversed what is now Muckaty Station, with repeater stations built at Powell's Creek to the north and Tennant's Creek to the south. At the same time as the telegraph line was completed in August 1872, a cattle industry was beginning to develop in central and northern Australia. The first pastoral lease in the Northern Territory was granted in 1872, and by 1911 there were at least 250 such leases covering over 180,000 square miles (470,000 km2) of the jurisdiction. The Muckaty pastoral lease was created in the late 19th century.

Article: Bright blue Citi Bikes are becoming a fine sight in the New Yorker street. New Yorkers are gradually getting used to more pedaling passengers on those blue Citi Bikes. But what about local bike shops ? Is City Bike booming at their expense? At Gotham Bikes in Tribeca, a manager who gave his name as \\"Ben W.\\" said the shop has seen an increase in its overall sales due to the bike-share program. \\"It's getting more people on the road, more people learning about the sport and getting involved,\\" he said. An employee at Danny's Cycles in Gramercy said Citi Bike is a good option for people in a city famed for its traffic jams and aggressive drivers. \\"They can try out a bike without buying one:' James Ryan said. Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny's Cycles. But for Frank's Bike Shop, a small business on Grand St., the bike-share program has been bad news. Owner Frank Arroyo said that his rental business has decreased by 90% since Citi Bike was launched last month. Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists, who have since been drawn away by Citi Bikes. However, Ben said the bike-share is good for bike sales at his shop. \\"People have used the bike-share and realized how great it is to bike in the city, then decide that they want something nicer for themselves,\\" he noted. Christian Farrell of Waterfront Bicycle Shop, on West St. said at first he was concerned about bike-share, though, he admitted, \\"I was happy to see people on bikes.\\" Farrell's early concerns were repeated by Andrew Crooks, owner of NYC Velo, at 64 Second Ave. \\"It seemed like a great idea, but one that would be difficult to put into use:' Crooks said of Citi Bike.

The New York Times reported that a top cardiologist said an online calculator central to new guidelines that tell doctors when to prescribe cholesterol medicine is over-estimating people’s risk of heart attacks and strokes – thereby putting more patients on statin drugs, the now-generic medicines that were once the best-sellers for Pfizer and Merck. “I actually support probably 80% of what’s in these guidelines because they’ve taken major steps forward that are going to improve care,” says Paul Ridker of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the critic whose analysis was published in The Lancet yesterday. The good: the new guidelines, from the AHA and American College of Cardiology, consider stroke risk in addition to that of a heart attacks; they guide doctors to use higher doses of statins; and they make the decision to give the drugs simpler, he says. But when Ridker started entering patients into the calculator, the results didn’t make sense to him. A 55-year-old man who smoked and had high blood pressure but not elevated cholesterol got a statin, and a 60-year-old woman with high cholesterol but no other risk factors would not. His concerns got more serious when his co-author, Brigham statistician Susan Cook, told him that she shared his concerns. Cook tested the calculator in data recorded from three big studies funded by the by the National Institutes of Health: the Women’s Health Study (WHS), the Physicians Health Study (PHS), and the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study. The risk of heart attack and stroke predicted by the AHA/ACC calculator was double that actually experienced by the people in these studies. And the full guideline analysis produced by the AHA and ACC seems to back up Ridker’s analysis. Deep in this document the guidelines committee tested its calculator against two clinical trials called MESA and REGARDS. I’ve included a graph of the MESA data in this post – it clearly shows that the risk calculator is again overestimating the risk to patients. As the guideline writers put it, on page 38: “Overprediction of events was noted in all validation groups, particularly for MESA and REGARDS.” From the ACC/AHA guidelines; the red lines represent the calculator, the blue lines the observed risk. The AHA and ACC have re-iterated their confidence in the calculator. Donald Lloyd-Jones, a cardiologist at Northwestern involved in writing the guidelines, says that the reason patients in MESA had a lower risk is because many of them started taking statins; the ten-year calculator is supposed to tell patients their risk without treatment. He also says the criticisms are “not fair” and that “these are some of the most heavily scrutinized documents” he has ever been involved with. The guidelines, which started as a government effort under the auspices of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, went through many levels of scientific peer review. Moreover, Lloyd-Jones says, the new guidelines do not suggest that doctors should be slaves to the risk calculator. The ten-year risk is driven by age, he says, but he himself would treat the woman who came out as low risk in Ridker’s example or someone who had an extreme family history and the guidelines include caveats encouraging doctors to think beyond the risk calculator, he says. Ridker counters that maybe people smoke less and eat better than in some of the older studies used to develop the risk calculator. Whatever reviews the AHA/ACC guidelines went through, the criticism not only from Ridker but from Steven Nissen, a past-president of the ACC, indicate that he calculator could have used broader vetting. Instead of a private peer-review, an open debate with the intention of validating the calculator before it became official would have avoided this controversy. But that’s only the first way in which this event argues for a movement beyond twentieth century science to something new. To cardiologists, who are largely in awe of the life-saving power of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it can be easy to forget how these medicines are viewed by much of the rest of the country and how controversial it is to suggest that a third of adults should be taking them, as these new guidelines do. There is a fundamental problem of medical science here. There is a good scientific rationale for taking statin drugs when risk is low and continuing them for decades. The risk of heart attack or stroke increases slowly as plaque builds up inside the artery walls and becomes inflamed. Slowing this process may take time. As evidence, patients with mutations in a gene called PCSK9 that caused them to have 15% lower levels of LDL cholesterol (the bad kind) had a 47% lower risk of heart attack. That’s half as much as a statin would decrease LDL or less, but these people walk around with lower cholesterol for their entire lives. That’s a huge potential benefit. But taking a statin for a long time is a huge leap of faith, because medical decisions are made based on clinical trials, big tests of drugs in people. In these studies, there is a huge mountain of evidence that statins save lives when given to people with heart disease– for instance, those who have already had a heart attack. And there is also strong evidence that those who have not had a heart attack but are at high risk can reduce their risk with a statin. But using statins to prevent a first heart attack or stroke can be controversial because in people who are at relatively low risk, you have to treat a lot of them to prevent one heart attack. This is where people who think the side effects of statins are worse than cardiologists generally believe or those who want to adhere stringently to the evidence from clinical trials can reasonably differ from some gung-ho statin advocates. What is really needed is a way to test medicines beyond the five-year timeframe of even a big clinical trial. The obvious way to do this would be with a nationally integrated electronic health record system that actively collects data and uses it for scientific research. But right now our electronic health records system is fragmented, with efforts only now underway to get data shared between different systems made by rivals like Epic Systems, Cerner Cerner, and AthenaHealth. Such systems could be used to do things like test and improve risk calculators, better track side effects, and monitor the real-world efficacy of drugs. Right now, we try to do that with insurance claims, which is far from a perfect way to move forward. Medicine needs good data science if it’s ever going to build on the certainty we get from clinical trials. (For more on this topic, see the embedded video from the Forbes Healthcare Summit.) Better EHRs would have an another impact here: instead of asking primary care doctors to calculate a patient’s risk themselves, the computer could automatically do it for them. Says Sanjay Kaul of Cedars Sinai Health System, one of cardiology’s great skeptics: “I remain skeptical of the use of risk calculator by clinicians to drive their decision to put their patients on statins, unless it is embedded in the EHR to be used at the point of care and it is coded as a ‘billable’ activity for reimbursement.” In the meantime, another drug-company-related note on the new guidelines. I’ve written before that the guidelines are indifferent to most drug makers because all the statins but AstraZeneca's AstraZeneca's Crestor are generic. They also may be bad for companies developing new drugs that block PCSK9 because they demand proof from clinical trials that a medicine reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke before it becomes widely used; that could hurt Amgen, Regeneron, Sanofi, and Pfizer. But there is a silver lining for those developing PCSK9 shots. If these guidelines do result in a lot more patients trying statins, there will be a lot more people who turn out to be unable to tolerate statins because they get muscle side effects or other issues. They would all be strong candidates for a PCSK9 shot if those drugs reach the market.","output":"A top cardiologist has claimed that an online calculator, central to new guidelines for prescribing cholesterol medication, is over-estimating people's risk of heart attacks and strokes, thereby putting more patients on statin drugs.

His comments have sparked discussions and speculations on which key positions he might address and which players' names are on his list of potential signings. The Need for Reinforcements Chelsea has been performing well in the Premier League, partly due to their tactical formation under Conte's leadership. However, their recent performances have shown that there might be a need for reinforcements in certain areas of the field, as injuries and suspensions have left some gaps in the team, ultimately affecting the quality of their play and, consequently, their results. Positions and Players of Interest One of the areas in which Chelsea could potentially strengthen is in their defense. Their current back line has shown some vulnerability, and Conte might look for a center-back or a left-back that can offer more stability and depth to the squad. It is rumored that several big names have been linked with a potential move to Chelsea, including Dutch center-backs Stefan de Vrij and Virgil van Dijk, as well as Premier League experienced players like Kieran Trippier and Danny Rose. The midfield is another area where the Blues may look to gain more creativity and grit through January signings. Conte may keep his eyes on players such as PSG's Adrien Rabiot, Nice's Jean-Michael Seri, or AS Roma's Lorenzo Pellegrini, all of whom offer different skill sets that can complement their existing midfield. Closing Thoughts The January transfer window brings a perfect opportunity for Antonio Conte to refresh and refuel his squad for the second half of the season. By reinforcing the weaker areas of the team, Chelsea can improve their chances of challenging for the Premier League title. While there is no guarantee that Chelsea will be able to secure all or any of their top targets during the January transfer window, one thing is for sure: Antonio Conte is serious about trying to strengthen his side, and his actions will be closely monitored by football fans worldwide"},{"instruction":"If I tell you that Transport of neurotransmitters is active transport, and ask you the question \\"the transport of what requires energy?\\", is the correct answer \\"communication\\"?

C: Wear a life jacket if you fish from a boat in a lake D: Put your head out of a moving bus for a better view Answer:","output":"To determine the wrong piece of advice among the options, I will review the advice given in the article and compare it to each option. Option A: Do not talk to anyone whom you don't know. This corresponds to the advice in the article that says \\"But do not talk to anyone you do not know.\\" Therefore, this option is not wrong. Option B: Look both ways before you cross the road. This advice aligns with the article: \\"Before crossing the road, stop and look both ways. Look left, look right, look left again.\\" Therefore, this option is not wrong. Option C: Wear a life jacket if you fish from a boat in a lake. This advice is related to the article's suggestion: \\"Wear a life jacket whenever you go out in a boat. Even if you are not in the open sea and the water is not deep, you should have your life jacket on.\\" So, this option is also not wrong. Option D: Put your head out of a moving bus for a better view. This advice goes against the article's recommendation: \\"Do not put your head out of a car, bus or train. Many children have been killed by doing this.\\" Hence, this option is wrong.

Thor (Bryan Grant) shows his alien contempt for Earth's creatures by vaporizing a dog named Sparky. Crew member Derek (David Love), after discovering an inscription on Sparky's dog tag, fears that the Gargon might destroy Earth's native inhabitants. This makes the other aliens scoff at the thought. Being members of the \\"supreme race\\", they disdain \\"foreign beings\\", no matter how intelligent; they pride themselves that \\"families\\" and \\"friendships\\" are forbidden on their world. Derek turns out to be a member of an alien underground that commemorates the more humane periods of their world's history. Their one Gargon seems to be sick in Earth's atmosphere. While his crew mates are distracted, Derek leaves. Eventually, the Gargon seems to revive. When the Captain reports his actions, Derek is quickly connected to their Leader (Gene Sterling); Derek, it turns out, is the Leader's son, although Derek is unaware of this. Thor is sent to hunt down Derek, with orders to kill him in order to protect their mission to Earth. They return to their base, leaving the Gargon behind. Meanwhile, Derek finds the home address he found on the dog's tag. There he meets Betty Morgan (Dawn Anderson) and her Grandpa Joe (Harvey B. Dunn). They have a room to rent, and Derek inadvertently becomes a boarder. When Betty's boyfriend, reporter Joe Rogers (Tom Graeff), can't make their afternoon date, Derek tags along with Betty. He shows the tag to Betty, who recognizes it immediately. Derek takes her to the place where the spaceship landed and shows her Sparky's remains. She doesn't believe him, so he describes Thor's weapon that can also vaporize humans. Betty takes this surprisingly well and vows to help Derek stop his crew mate. For the rest of the day, Betty and Derek have several run-ins with Thor, and Joe follows up on stories of skeletons popping up all over... A:","output":"Question: In the movie plot, how does Derek's discovery of Sparky's dog tag and his involvement with an alien underground movement lead to a series of encounters with the antagonist Thor, and how do these events contribute to the growing conflict between Derek's loyalties to his newfound Earth friends and his alien origin?"},{"instruction":"Given the question: I read this background article the other day: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. I am facing a new situation today: Vince had a small rural farm. He needed to increase production and efficiency, so he started using herbicides. Danny was one of his farmer friends, he had a small acreage farm and he practiced permaculture, so no pesticides. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which farmer planted fewer crops tolerant to herbicide? The answer is:","output":"Danny planted fewer crops tolerant to herbicide. Step 1: Identify the practices of each farmer - Vince is using herbicides to increase production and efficiency. - Danny practices permaculture and does not use pesticides. Step 2: Relate the farmers' practices to herbicide tolerance - Vince, who uses herbicides, is more likely to plant crops that are tolerant to herbicides. This would help him maximize the benefits of using herbicides without harming his crops. - Danny, on the other hand, does not use pesticides. Since he practices permaculture, it is likely that he values natural methods of pest and weed control. Therefore, he would have less need for herbicide-tolerant crops. Step 3: Compare the two farmers - Given their respective farming methods, Danny would have planted fewer herbicide-tolerant crops than Vince."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation: The statement shall be addressed to the Danish Pharmaceutical Society before the 1 July","output":"The statement shall be addressed to the Danish Pharmaceutical Society before the 1st of July."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: when did cornwall council became a unitary authority?","output":"To complete this task, I need to search for the date when Cornwall Council became a unitary authority.

Widely regarded as the greatest wicket-keeper-batsman in the history of the game, Gilchrist held the world record for the most dismissals by a wicket-keeper in One Day International (ODI) cricket until it was surpassed by Kumar Sangakkara in 2015 and the most by an Australian in Test cricket. He was captain of Middlesex in the domestic arena. Gilchrist was selected for the state under-17 team, and in 1989 he was offered a scholarship by London-based Richmond Cricket Club, a scheme he now supports himself. Cricket has for many years debated whether batsmen should \\"walk\\", that is to agree that they have been dismissed and leave the field of play without waiting for (or contrary to) an umpire's decision. Gilchrist reignited this debate by walking during a high-profile match, the 2003 World Cup semi-final against Sri Lanka, after the umpire ruled him to be not out. He has since proclaimed himself to be \\"a walker\\", or a batsman who will consistently walk, and has done so on numerous occasions. On one occasion against Bangladesh, Gilchrist walked but TV replays failed to suggest any contact between his bat and the ball. Without such contact, he could not have been caught out. Gilchrist's actions have sparked debate amongst current and former players and umpires. Ricky Ponting has declared on several occasions that he is not a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not. While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz both walked during Test matches in India in 2004. In 2004, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a \\"walking crusade\\" when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane. After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: \\"...not everyone is walking, Gilly ... not everyone has to walk, mate...\\". The taunt was effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket. Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had \\"zero support in the team\\" for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. He added that he \\"felt isolated\\" and \\"silently accused of betraying the team. Implicitly I was made to feel selfish, as if I was walking for the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest.\\" Gilchrist has been noted for his emotional outbursts on the cricket field, and has been fined multiple times for dissent against umpiring decisions. In January 2006, he was fined 40% of his match fee in an ODI against South Africa. In another instance, in early 2004 in Sri Lanka, Gilchrist audibly argued with umpire Peter Manuel after batting partner Andrew Symonds was given out. After the argument concluded, Manuel consulted umpiring partner Billy Bowden and reversed his decision, recalling Symonds to the crease. Gilchrist was also reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board for publicly questioning the legality of Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling action in 2002, as his comments were found to be in breach of the clause in the player code of conduct relating to \\"detrimental public comment\\". During the 2003 World Cup, Gilchrist accused Pakistani wicketkeeper Rashid Latif of making a racist remark towards him while the latter was batting in their group match. Latif who was cleared by match referee Clive Lloyd, threatened to sue Gilchrist for this claim. What happened in the 2003 world cup match?","output":"In the 2003 World Cup match, Gilchrist reignited the debate about \\"walking\\" when he decided to walk during a high-profile match, the semi-final against Sri Lanka, after the umpire ruled him to be not out.

Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \\"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity.

Warlock is a small Utah mining town of the early 1880s. Cowboys working for Abe McQuown often come into town to shoot the place up, kill on just a whim, beating or humiliating any sheriff who tries to stand up to them. The Citizens' Committee decides to hire Clay Blaisedell, a renowned gunfighter, as town marshal in spite of the misgivings of some, such as old Judge Holloway who insists that the situation should be handled within the law (though a loophole prevents it from being done effectively). Blaisedell, famous for his golden-handled revolvers, arrives in Warlock with his devoted friend, Tom Morgan, his club-footed, right-hand man, who is no slouch with a gun himself. Morgan has a reputation as a heavy-drinking gambler, but Blaisedell insists that Morgan is part of the package. They even take over the local saloon and rename it the \\"French Palace\\" (something they appear to have done in previous towns, since they bring the signboard with them). Their first encounter with McQuown's men is without bloodshed. The cowboys are intimidated by Blaisedell and one, Johnny Gannon, stays behind. Gannon has been put off by their propensity for killing, particularly the shooting of victims in the back, for some time now and resolves to be more law-abiding. Morgan learns that his old flame, Lily Dollar, is coming to town on the stagecoach, and she is accompanied by Bob Nicholson, brother of Big Ben Nicholson, who was recently killed by Blaisedell.

(CNN) -- The Taliban, one of Osama bin Laden's closest allies, confirmed late Friday that the al Qaeda founder had been killed by U.S. commandos during a raid in Pakistan. The admission by the Taliban comes on the heels of one earlier in the day by al Qaeda, removing any question about whether bin Laden's closest allies and his terror network believed he was dead. Al Qaeda statement on bin Laden's death Bin Laden \\"embraced martyrdom as per the Will of the Almighty Allah during an abrupt attack by the American invading soldiers,\\" according to a statement released by the Afghan Taliban, which had for years allowed bin Laden's terror network to operate in Afghanistan. The statement also expressed disdain for the efforts and motives of the United States, saying that the","output":"killing of bin Laden would not affect their mission and that it would only serve to further galvanize their resolve. \\"The martyrdom of Sheikh Osama will not end our jihad,\\" the statement read. \\"Our campaign against the invaders and their puppet regimes will continue until we achieve our goals of establishing the rule of Islamic Shariah in our countries and driving out the foreign forces that have oppressed our people for too long.\\" While the Taliban and al Qaeda have had a long-standing relationship, the death of bin Laden has the potential to strain ties between the two groups. Historically, bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders have provided financial and logistical support to the Taliban in their fight against foreign forces in Afghanistan. However, with the death of bin Laden and the continued pressure on al Qaeda by the United States and its allies, the group's ability to support the Taliban in the same manner may diminish. Despite this potential setback, both the Taliban and al Qaeda have demonstrated their ability to adapt and evolve in the face of adversity. As the world continues to grapple with the effects of terrorism and political instability, it is essential that governments remain vigilant and work together to confront these ever-evolving threats. The death of bin Laden, while a significant achievement in the war on terror, is but one battle in a long and ongoing conflict against extremism. In addition to the impact on the Taliban and al Qaeda, bin Laden's death has had far-reaching consequences for global counterterrorism efforts. The raid on the compound in Pakistan has led to increased scrutiny of Pakistan's role in the war on terror, raising questions about the country's murky relationship with extremist groups and their possible complicity in harboring terrorists. Furthermore, it has renewed the debate over the effectiveness of targeted killings and the ethics of utilizing such tactics in the war on terror. The United States and its allies, in response to the death of bin Laden and the ensuing power vacuum within al Qaeda, have accelerated their efforts to dismantle the group's network of operatives and sympathizers. Intelligence agencies have worked tirelessly to analyze the treasure trove of information seized during the raid on bin Laden's compound, which has resulted in numerous high-value targets being located and targeted in the ensuing years. As the fight against terrorism continues, it is essential that governments remain committed to collaborative efforts, share intelligence, and prioritize the safety and security of their citizens. While the death of Osama bin Laden has dealt a significant blow to al Qaeda and its affiliates, it remains crucial for the global community to maintain pressure on these extremist groups, ensure they do not regain the capabilities they once possessed, and ultimately work to create a safer, more secure world for all."},{"instruction":"Oh, where are you going, my little one, little one...

Yet he was too proud to accept anything from the people in the village. Once, these veterans held a reunion dinner in the home of Jules Grandin, who had made a good deal of money. Grandin produced a curiosity --a large old gold coin. Each man examined it with interest as it passed around the long table. All, however, had drunk wine freely and the room was full of noisy talk, so that the gold piece was soon forgotten. Later, when Grandin remembered it and asked for it, the coin was missing. One of them suggested everyone be searched, to which all agreed, except Blustering. \\"You refuse, then?\\" asked Grandin. Blustering said with a red face, \\"Yes, I cannot allow it.\\" One by one, the others turned out their pockets. When the coin failed to appear, attention was focused on poor Blustering. Under the pitying stares of his friends, he walked out and returned to his home. A few years later, Grandin made his house repaired.

To avoid freezing in his shack, Foghorn decides to woo Miss Prissy (\\"I need your love to keep me warm\\"), who lives in a warm, cozy cottage across the way. Miss Prissy is flattered by Foghorn's two-second courtship but tells him that, to prove his worthiness as her mate, he needs to show that he can be a worthy father to her bookish-looking son. The little boy – Egghead Jr., a chick similar in appearance to Tweety, dressed in a stocking cap and oversized glasses – would rather read about \\"Splitting the Fourth Dimension\\" than engage in typical little boy games. Foghorn immediately catches on to this and sets out to win his audition by showing Egghead Jr. how to play various sports games.

Produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was the most expensive album ever recorded at the time of its release. The album takes its name from the Marx Brothers film of the same name, which the band watched one night at the studio complex when recording. A Night at the Opera incorporates a wide range of styles, including ballads, songs in a music hall style, hard rock tracks and progressive rock influences. \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" is amongst Roger Taylor's most famous songs in the Queen catalogue. The song was initially taken as a joke by May, who thought that Taylor was not serious when he heard a demo recording. Taylor played the guitars in the original demo, but they were later re-recorded by May on his Red Special. The lead vocals were performed by Taylor on the studio version, and all released live versions. The revving sounds at the conclusion of the song were recorded by Taylor's then current car, an Alfa Romeo. The lyrics were inspired by one of the band's roadies, Johnathan Harris, whose Triumph TR4 was evidently the \\"love of his life\\". The song is dedicated to him, the album says: \\"Dedicated to Johnathan Harris, boy racer to the end\\". When it came down to releasing the album's first single, Taylor was so fond of his song that he urged Mercury (author of the first single, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\") to allow it to be the B-side and reportedly locked himself in a cupboard until Mercury agreed. This decision would later become the cause of much internal friction in the band, in that while it was only the B-side, it generated an equal amount of publishing royalties for Taylor as the main single did for Mercury. The song was often played live during the 1977-81 period. Taylor sang it from the drums while Mercury played piano and provided backing vocals. It was played in the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour in 2005 and the Rock the Cosmos Tour in 2008. Taylor would again play the song for his concerts with The Cross and solo tours, where instead of drums he played rhythm guitar. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: was it on the B side?","output":"Yes, it was on the B-side. The quote from the article states, \\"When it came down to releasing the album's first single, Taylor was so fond of his song that he urged Mercury (author of the first single, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\") to allow it to be the B-side and reportedly locked himself in a cupboard until Mercury agreed.\\""},{"instruction":"Title: Poor look at Pharmaceutical Sales Review: The people who are involved in the making of this film are all very clueless.

Adam Shergold. and Pete Jenson. PUBLISHED:. 03:00 EST, 7 February 2014. |. UPDATED:. 08:47 EST, 7 February 2014. The referee who dismissed Cristiano Ronaldo in Real Madrid's draw at Athletic Bilbao last weekend has been suspended amid suggestions he changed his story of the incident. The Spanish League's Refereeing Technical Committee (CTA) has dropped Miguel Angel Ayza Gamez for a month and he has been barred from officiating Real matches this season. According to reports in Spain, there is a real danger he could be demoted from the list of La Liga match officials following his poor handling of the game. Scroll down to read Graham Poll's verdict on the suspension. Rejected: Cristiano Ronaldo's appeal against his three-match suspension has been denied. Dismissed: Ronaldo was sent off in the 75th minute of the 1-1 draw at San Mames, a damaging result in the context of their La Liga title challenge. Bewildered: The Portuguese could scarcely believe he had been sent off. Ronaldo was sent off for the seventh time in his career in the 75th minute of Sunday's 1-1 draw at San Mames after he raised his hand to Bilbao captain Carlos Gurpegi, who fell to the floor theatrically. He also confronted Bilbao midfielder Ander Iturraspe during an ugly melee. Ayza Gamez is understood to have originally stated that he sent Ronaldo off for the incident with Gurpegi but then changed his story to say he had dismissed him for pushing Iturraspe - a fracas the Bilbao player started. Valencia born referee Ayza Gamez has a reputation in Spain for being consistently poor. For the last three seasons he has finished far enough down the refereeing authority's end of season's rankings that he has been a major candidate to be relegated to the second tier. He doesn't have the arrogance of several of his even more unpopular colleagues and is liable to be pressured into making mistakes by players rather than erring because of an exaggerated desire to be the focus of every game - but he is seen as incompetent all the same. He fell over in the Athletic Bilbao vs Real Madrid game last weekend and that fits his reputation for not being in control. He is also criticized for lacking the character needed to officiate in the top flight. Madrid have complained previously over his failure to send Dani Alves for dissent in a match where he had booked the full-back but then allowed him to call him 'loco' (crazy) to his face. PETE JENSON. Squaring up: Ronaldo argues with Bilbao midfielder Ander Iturraspe, sparking a melee involving a number of players from both sides. Trouble: Ronaldo puts his head into the face of Iturraspe having swiped his hand across the face of Bilbao captain Carlos Gurpegi (left) Scrap: Ronaldo postures as the players square up to each other. Ronaldo has been banned for three matches and will miss his team's forthcoming fixtures against Villarreal, Getafe and Elche - a major blow in Real's bid to beat rivals Atletico Madrid and Barcelona to the title. The Portuguese, who turned 29 on Wednesday, was banned for one match for violent conduct and a further two matches for dissent as he walked from the field. He was also fined just under £1,000. However, the news that Ayza Gamez has been suspended will encourage Real in their appeal against Ronaldo's ban. The innocent one: Ronaldo stands back as the arguments carry on. Long walk off: Ronaldo leaves the pitch after being shown a straight red card. The Spanish Football Federation's Appeals Committee convenes on Friday to consider their argument. Ronaldo, the Ballon d'Or winner who has scored 32 goals in 31 matches this season, is still eligible to play in the Copa del Rey and featuring during the midweek 3-0 win over Atletico at the Bernabeu. He will also be able to play in next week's second leg. Wow! What a remarkable decision by the Spanish Refereeing Technical Committee. I wouldn’t like to be the next referee who officiates in a Real Madrid game. This is all about Madrid. The fact Miguel Angel Ayza Gamez has been given a one month suspension and told he cannot referee any more Madrid games indicates the power and influence they have. It may have been a harsh red, but we have seen those before. The chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee is Spanish too, so he will be taking an interest in this. It also comes out the day Cristiano Ronaldo has his appeal hearing, which suggest he will be treated with leniency. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. Cristiano Ronaldo was dismissed in Real Madrid's draw at Athletic Bilbao, and the referee, Miguel Angel Ayza Gamez, has been suspended amid suggestions that he changed his story of the incident. 2. The Spanish League's Refereeing Technical Committee (CTA) has suspended Gamez for a month and barred him from officiating Real Madrid matches this season. 3.

His estranged ex-wife, Doreen, has filed a restraining order against him and taken sole custody of their young son, Rex. Lucille wants Melvin to clean up and get sober, but Melvin only makes empty promises to eventually get his life together. Lucas, a science teacher at the local community college, performs regular tests on Melvin, who has telekinetic powers – the ability to move objects with his mind. Lucas can not explain this except that Melvin has a slightly different brain structure than ordinary people. Melvin will not see a specialist despite Lucas' urging.

But I can use this background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina).

Unlike salmon, shad retain the ability to digest and assimilate food during the anadromous migration. Like other fish, their feeding instinct can be triggered by a variety of factors such as turbidity and water temperature. Anglers use both spinning and fly fishing tackle to pursue shad. Spin fisherman use a shad dartjig or a flutter spoon. Some anglers use a downrigger to place the artificial lure at the desired depth and location. This is usually in the channel, or deepest part of the river. Migrating shad tend to occupy the lower portion of the water column which makes this the typical depth of choice for fishing. In the North, April through June is when shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries once water temperatures have reached 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions typically improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases. and the situation: Jeff loves to go shad fishing. He prefers using fly fishing tackle and is planning a fishing trip up North with his buddies. They decided to take their trip in May when everyone can get off work over the Memorial Day holiday. Sam enjoys shad fishing as well, but the only time he and his buddies are able to take off work is during their slow season in March. Answer the following question: Who will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on their fishing trip, Jeff or Sam? A:","output":"Sam will likely have worse fishing conditions and catch less shad on their fishing trip compared to Jeff. This is because Sam and his buddies are planning their trip in March, which is earlier in the year than the optimal shad spawning season. The ideal time for shad fishing in the North is from April through June, when water temperatures reach 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C) and the shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries. Fishing conditions improve as water temperatures warm and water flow decreases. In contrast, Jeff and his buddies plan their trip in May, during the Memorial Day holiday, which falls within the typical shad spawning season. As a result, they can expect better fishing conditions and a higher likelihood of catching shad compared to Sam's trip in March."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A dog has a wetsuit in his mouth on the beach.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A dog is burying a bone in the dirt.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

American officials have long accused Pakistan of providing clandestine support to the militants who attack American-led forces in Afghanistan even as the Pakistanis say they support the American war there. And while American leaders have encouraged warming ties between Afghanistan and Pakistan, they also fear that Pakistani officials want to exert too much control over Afghan politics. The success of the deal is far from assured. Pakistan’s prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, alluded to potential domestic fallout at a meeting with Mrs. Clinton, who arrived under heavy security on Sunday. “There are people, there are lobbies who don’t want this,” he said, noting that the deal’s opponents were agitating in the news media. But he added, “It is in the interest of Pakistan to have a stable Afghanistan.” A critical provision of the deal would allow Afghan trucks to carry goods to Pakistani ports like Karachi or as far as Indian border posts, while Pakistani trucks could travel into Afghanistan. Under current law, goods must be reloaded at the border. The accord cast a positive glow over Mrs. Clinton’s visit, which is meant to ease suspicions between Pakistan and the United States. She came with a number of initiatives in public health, water distribution and agriculture, to be financed by 500 million in American economic aid. Among other projects, the United States will build a 60-bed hospital in Karachi and help farmers export mangos. These projects, however beneficial in this economically fragile country, do not dispel other nagging sources of friction between the two sides. In addition to American doubts about Pakistan’s commitment to root out Taliban insurgents, there are new fears about Pakistan’s nuclear program. Pakistan plans to buy two nuclear reactors from China, a deal that alarms the United States because it is cloaked in secrecy and is being conducted outside the global nonproliferation regime. Administration officials said Mrs. Clinton was expected to raise the issue with the Pakistanis. Relations could be further tested if the Obama administration decides to place leaders of a major Pakistani insurgent group, the Haqqani network, on the State Department’s terrorist list. Islamabad maintains ties to the group through its intelligence service, and it is seeking to exploit those connections to extend its influence over Afghanistan. For all that, tensions between the two sides have ebbed since Mrs. Clinton’s last visit here in October, when she was peppered with hostile questions in public meetings and bluntly suggested that people in the Pakistani government knew the whereabouts of Al Qaeda’s leaders. Mr. Holbrooke noted a U-turn in Pakistan’s policy on issuing visas to American diplomats. For months, Pakistani officials had held up those applications, creating a huge backlog and frustrating the United States. But Pakistan issued 450 visas in the last five days, he said. He conceded that public opinion polls here about the United States had yet to show much of a change. Conspiracy theories involving the United States are widely popular, with large numbers of Pakistanis blaming the United States for anything that goes wrong here. Some analysts here said that the United States had failed to communicate its support adequately through the local news media. Mrs. Clinton may take more hits on Monday at a town hall meeting here. Still, American officials were emphasizing convergence between the United States and Pakistan. While the Americans would like to see a more aggressive Pakistani military push in North Waziristan, the stronghold of the Haqqani network, they praised the military’s campaigns in South Waziristan and the Swat Valley, where Taliban insurgents had also made gains. Pakistan’s battle has exacted a fearful toll. This month a suicide bomber killed 45 people in an attack on a Sufi shrine in Lahore. Many Pakistanis blame the war in Afghanistan for fomenting anti-Pakistan terrorism. Protest groups issued a statement, timed to Mrs. Clinton’s arrival, that called for an end to the war and for Americans and Pakistanis who are involved in clandestine air strikes on Pakistani targets to be tried for war crimes. Mrs. Clinton’s initiatives are the first major disbursements of 7.5 billion in nonmilitary aid, over five years, pledged by Congress last year. The emphasis is on basic services like electricity and water, politically charged issues in this country, particularly during the hot summer. “Our commitment is broad and deep,” said Rajiv Shah, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, who is with Mrs. Clinton. “We will not do what we’ve done in the past.” Administration officials said the project to upgrade Pakistan’s creaky power grid, which involves building dams and refurbishing power plants, had helped reduce chronic power failures. But on the day Mrs. Clinton landed, television reports here warned of further blackouts.

Queen Elizabeth's old dresses, particularly the ones with historical significance or that were worn on special occasions, can have various fates. Some of them might be preserved by the Royal Collection Trust - an institution responsible for the care and conservation of items with historical, artistic, or cultural importance to the British Monarchy. These dresses can be displayed in exhibitions or loaned to other institutions for special events or public displays. Additionally, dresses having lesser significance could potentially be repurposed, donated, or even sold in auctions or charity events. Personal items, such as clothing, belonging to royal family members have found their way into auctions and charity sales in the past.

The League have officials at every La Liga match and the one at Barcelona’s meeting with Levante at the weekend included hearing the song in their report. If the Spanish League reports it to the Antiviolence Committee Barcelona could be fined or even have a part of the Nou Camp closed. The steps being considered are a result of Spanish football’s intention of cutting out all forms of crowd trouble or incitement to crowd trouble since a Deportivo supporter was killed in a pitched battle before a match at Atletico Madrid’s Vicente Calderon stadium in November. Barcelona fans chanted 'Ronaldo is a drunk' about Real Madrid star Cristiano at the Nou Camp. Barcelona could now face disciplinary action from the Spanish league. Pictured is their star man Lionel Messi. Despite what some might term 'terrace banter' appearing to have little to do with the organised violence that ended with a supporter being beaten to death outside a stadium last year, the football authorities have included chants and songs in their crackdown on trouble.

Given the context: What will Sydney want to do next? Possible answers: buy a home theater and watch documentals, go on vacation, work overtime at her current job A:","output":"Given the context, Sydney is focused on raising extra money and is in need of cash. Therefore, the most likely option Sydney would want to do next is to work overtime at her current job. This is because working overtime can provide her with an opportunity to earn more money, thus addressing her immediate need for cash. Buying a home theater and watching documentaries is not a suitable choice in this context, as it would require Sydney to spend money rather than raise it. Moreover, watching documentaries might be a recreational activity but would not help her financially in the short term. Similarly, going on vacation is an unlikely choice for Sydney since it also involves spending money instead of raising the funds she needs. Vacations can be costly, including expenses such as flights, accommodations, meals, and other activities. Choosing this option would not only keep her from meeting her financial goals but may also potentially put her in a more challenging financial situation. In conclusion, given the context of Sydney's need for extra cash, it is most reasonable to assume that she would want to work overtime at her current job. This option directly addresses her financial concerns and allows her to accumulate the necessary funds without incurring additional expenses. Sydney will likely take time evaluating her options, considering her skills, and optimizing her work schedule to make the most of overtime opportunities, ultimately making progress towards her goal of raising extra cash."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

Frustrated writer Michael Caine plots to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it off as his own; his devious plan may include murdering the talented kid, which has Caine's flighty spouse up in arms. The first act in which everyone is introduced is excruciatingly dead, with Caine doing everything an actor can to keep the pacing up. Dyan Cannon is miscast as his wife (she's too smart and clever herself to be passed off as a ditz) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle portion of the film) seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the better writer. These three characters, and Irene Worth's bothersome neighbor, are so undefined that what happens after the set-up barely even registers until well after the second act has begun. Sidney Lumet's direction is stagy and fuzzy, the set design unconvincing and poorly-lit, and the finale is a total disaster. The actors struggle to give the script some substance, but with such thin material all we see are their laborious efforts. *1/2 from **** Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"The review is predominantly negative about the movie.

The answer is:","output":"The missing first step in this process is the weathering and erosion of rocks. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Weathering and erosion of rocks: The process begins with the breakdown of parent rocks into smaller fragments through processes like freeze-thaw cycles, wind, water, and other natural forces. This step is essential because it is the starting point for the subsequent formation of sedimentary rocks. 2. Wind or water deposits tiny rocks: Once the rocks have been weathered and eroded into smaller pieces, they can be transported and deposited by wind or water in various locations. 3. The rocks become known as sediment: After the tiny rocks have been deposited, they start to accumulate and become known as sediment. 4. The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top: Over time, additional layers of sediment are deposited on top of the existing layers, applying pressure and compacting the lower layers. 5. Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve: As the pressure increases, the minerals within the rocks begin to dissolve, enabling a chemical reaction to take place. 6. Minerals glue the sediment together into a single rock: As the dissolved minerals from the sediment react, they act as a natural cement to bind the individual sediment particles together, forming a cohesive, solid rock known as a sedimentary rock."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog with this premise \\"Noah can't find his iphone.\\".","output":"Step 1: Establish the setting and characters.

Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate..., can you guess it ?

He stated that he was born in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, in 1915, but it is believed to be more likely that he was born in Jug's Corner, in neighboring Issaquena County, in 1913. Recent research has uncovered documentation showing that in the 1930s and 1940s, before his rise to fame, the year of his birth was reported as 1913 on his marriage license, recording notes, and musicians' union card. A 1955 interview in the Chicago Defender is the earliest in which he stated 1915 as the year of his birth, and he continued to say this in interviews from that point onward. In August 1941, Alan Lomax went to Stovall, Mississippi, on behalf of the Library of Congress to record various country blues musicians. \\"He brought his stuff down and recorded me right in my house,\\" Muddy recalled for Rolling Stone magazine, \\"and when he played back the first song I sounded just like anybody's records. Man, you don't know how I felt that Saturday afternoon when I heard that voice and it was my own voice. Later on he sent me two copies of the pressing and a check for twenty bucks, and I carried that record up to the corner and put it on the jukebox. Just played it and played it and said, 'I can do it, I can do it.'\\" Lomax came back in July 1942 to record him again. Both sessions were eventually released by Testament Records as Down on Stovall's Plantation. The complete recordings were reissued by Chess Records on CD as Muddy Waters: The Complete Plantation Recordings. The Historic 1941-42 Library of Congress Field Recordings in 1993 and remastered in 1997. In 1943, Muddy Waters headed to Chicago with the hope of becoming a full-time professional musician. He lived with a relative for a short period while driving a truck and working in a factory by day and performing at night. Big Bill Broonzy, then one of the leading bluesmen in Chicago, had Muddy Waters open his shows in the rowdy clubs where Broonzy played. This gave Muddy Waters the opportunity to play in front of a large audience. In 1944, he bought his first electric guitar and then formed his first electric combo. He felt obliged to electrify his sound in Chicago because, he said, \\"When I went into the clubs, the first thing I wanted was an amplifier. Couldn't nobody hear you with an acoustic.\\" His sound reflected the optimism of postwar African Americans. Willie Dixon said that \\"There was quite a few people around singing the blues but most of them was singing all sad blues. Muddy was giving his blues a little pep.\\" Three years later, in 1946, he recorded some songs for Mayo Williams at Columbia Records, with an old-fashioned combo consisting of clarinet, saxophone and piano; they were released a year later with Ivan Ballen's Philadelphia-based 20th Century label, billed as James \\"Sweet Lucy\\" Carter and his Orchestra - Muddy Waters' name was not mentioned on the label. Later that year, he began recording for Aristocrat Records, a newly formed label run by the brothers Leonard and Phil Chess. In 1947, he played guitar with Sunnyland Slim on piano on the cuts \\"Gypsy Woman\\" and \\"Little Anna Mae\\". These were also shelved, but in 1948, \\"I Can't Be Satisfied\\" and \\"I Feel Like Going Home\\" became hits, and his popularity in clubs began to take off. Soon after, Aristocrat changed its name to Chess Records. Muddy Waters's signature tune \\"Rollin' Stone\\" also became a hit that year.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was his early career like?","output":"Muddy Waters' early career involved working in a factory by day and performing at night. He opened shows for Big Bill Broonzy, a leading bluesman at that time, which allowed Muddy to play in front of big audiences. In 1944, he bought his first electric guitar and formed his first electric combo, giving his blues a more energetic and upbeat sound compared to traditional sad blues."},{"instruction":"Use evidence from the fact that lava is found above the ground to answer this question: \\"Lava is found above the ground because when there is lava there is\\"","output":"Step 1: Identify the key information in the question The key information in this question is the fact that lava is found above the ground, and we must use this evidence to answer why that is the case. Step 2: Consider the properties of lava Lava is a hot, molten rock that is expelled from a volcanic eruption. It comes from deep within the Earth's mantle and can reach temperatures up to 1,200 degrees Celsius (2,200 degrees Fahrenheit). It is a highly viscous substance that flows relatively slowly. Step 3: Consider the source of lava Lava is the result of heat and pressure building up within the Earth's mantle, leading to the melting of rocks. This molten rock, or magma, rises towards the Earth's surface due to its lower density compared to the surrounding solid rock. This process occurs at tectonic plate boundaries, where the Earth's crust is thinner and more susceptible to fracturing. Step 4: Relate the properties and source of lava to its presence above the ground When the pressure from the rising magma becomes too great, it causes a volcanic eruption. This forces the molten rock out of the Earth's surface and exposes it to the atmosphere, where it then cools, solidifies, and forms lava. Step 5: Formulate an answer that uses the evidence to establish a cause Lava is found above the ground because when there is lava, there is a volcanic eruption. This eruption is caused by the buildup of pressure from rising magma within the Earth's mantle. The magma makes its way to the surface, where it is then exposed to the atmosphere as lava. The presence of lava above ground is evidence that there has been a volcanic eruption, which has forced the molten rock out from beneath the Earth's surface."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What type of details about women in docs can be gathered from the following bio?

Answer the above question based on the context below: In Britain, further experiments in the genre boosted its appeal. House and rave clubs such as Lakota and Cream emerged across Britain, hosting house and dance scene events. The 'chilling out' concept developed in Britain with ambient house albums such as The KLF's Chill Out and Analogue Bubblebath by Aphex Twin. The Godskitchen superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 90's rave scene. After initially hosting small nights in Cambridge and Northampton, the associated events scaled up in Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Leeds. A new indie dance scene also emerged in the 90's. In New York, bands such as Deee-Lite furthered house's international influence. Two distinctive tracks from this era were the Orb's \\"Little Fluffy Clouds\\" (with a distinctive vocal sample from Rickie Lee Jones) and the Happy Mondays' \\"Wrote for Luck\\" (\\"WFL\\") which was transformed into a dance hit by Vince Clarke. The late Robert Miles also produced house tracks such as \\"One and One\\" with Maria Nayler, \\"Fable\\" and his biggest hit, \\"Children\\". In England, one of the few licensed venues was The Eclipse, which attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours. Due to the lack of licensed, legal dance event venues, house music promoters began organising illegal events in unused warehouses, aeroplane hangars and in the countryside. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was a government attempt to ban large rave dance events featuring music with \\"repetitive beats\\", due to law enforcement allegations that these events were associated with illegal club drugs.

These recorded four separate sound signals. This was achieved on the two stereo channels by electronic matrixing, where the additional channels were combined into the main signal. When the records were played, phase-detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels. There were two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui). They proved commercially unsuccessful, but were an important precursor to later surround-sound systems, as seen in SACD and home cinema today.\\" Answer:","output":"The things necessary for the quadraphonic record process to function are: 1. Quadraphonic records: An essential component, these records are designed to store four separate sound signals. The development of quadraphonic records allowed for a more immersive audio experience compared to traditional stereo records. 2. Electronic matrixing: This technique is crucial for combining the four separate sound signals into two stereo channels. It enables the encoding of additional audio channels into the main signal, allowing for compatibility with existing stereo playback systems. 3. Phase-detection circuits: These circuits are necessary for decoding the matrixed signals back into four separate channels when the records are played. They are present in the amplifiers and help in accurately extracting the different audio channels from the combined signal. 4. Compatible amplifiers: Amplifiers with phase-detection circuits are required for the process to function properly. They decode the matrixed signals and play them back through the corresponding speaker setup. 5. Four-channel speaker setup: A speaker system with four discrete channels is necessary to project the separated sound signals and create a surround sound experience. 6. SQ or QS systems: The process relies on one of these competing systems (SQ by CBS or QS by Sansui) for encoding and decoding the quadraphonic signals. Both systems have their unique approaches to matrixing and decoding, but they must be compatible with the records and playback equipment used. In summary, the necessary components for the quadraphonic record process to function include quadraphonic records, electronic matrixing, phase-detection circuits, compatible amplifiers, a four-channel speaker setup, and the use of either an SQ or QS system."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence, generate a most unlikely next statement.

Their distinctive funk style drew on psychedelic culture, outlandish fashion, science-fiction, and surreal humor; it would have an influential effect on subsequent funk, post-punk, hip-hop, and post-disco artists of the 1980s and 1990s, while their collective mythology would help pioneer Afrofuturism. The collective's origins date back to the doo-wop group the Parliaments, formed by Clinton in the late 1950s in Plainfield, New Jersey. Under the influence of late-1960s artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and Frank Zappa, Clinton later relocated to Detroit and began the sister groups Parliament and Funkadelic, with the former playing an eclectic and more commercial form of funk, and the latter incorporating more influence from psychedelic rock. Context: In the early 1980s George Clinton continued to record while battling with financial problems and well-publicized drug problems. The remaining members of Parliament-Funkadelic recorded the 1982 hit album Computer Games, which was released as a George Clinton solo album. Included on this release was the much-sampled #1 hit single \\"Atomic Dog\\". The following year, Clinton formed the P-Funk All Stars, who went on to record Urban Dancefloor Guerillas in 1983. The P-Funk All Stars included many of the same members as the late-1970s version of the Parliament-Funkadelic collective, and was so named because of various legal issues concerning use of the names Parliament and Funkadelic after 1980. The name P-Funk All Stars is still in use to the current day, and group has included a mix of former Parliament-Funkadelic members as well as guests and new musicians. As the 1980s continued, P-Funk did not meet with great commercial success as the band continued to produce albums under the name of George Clinton as solo artist. P-Funk retired from touring from 1984 until 1989, except for extremely sporadic performances and TV appearances. It was at this time that Hip hop music began to extensively sample P-Funk music, so remnants of the music were still heard regularly, now among fans of Hip hop. By 1993, most of the Parliament and Funkadelic back catalog had been reissued. The same year saw the return of a reconstituted P-Funk All Stars, with the re-release of Urban Dancefloor Guerrillas under the title Hydraulic Funk, and a new hip hop influenced album Dope Dogs. In 1994, the group toured with the Lollapalooza festival and appeared in the film PCU. The 1996 album T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M. (The Awesome Power of a Fully Operational Mothership), released under the name George Clinton & the P-Funk All Stars, served as a reunion album featuring contributions from the band's most noteworthy songwriters from the earlier eras, such as Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, and Junie Morrison. It would be ten years before another album would be released. In the intervening time, successive tours would slowly restore some of the broken ties between the original band members, together with an accumulation of new talent. On July 23, 1999, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, including noteworthy former members Bootsy and Catfish Collins and Bernie Worrell, performed on stage at Woodstock '99. The collective continued to tour sporadically in to the 2000s, with participation from some of the children and grandchildren of the original members. Question: What was modern day like?. Whats the answer?","output":"Modern day for Parliament-Funkadelic is like a big family of musicians who continue to play music and perform together. Even though they had some challenges and not as much commercial success in the past, they still come together and perform at shows and events like Woodstock '99. They have a mix of old and new members, including some kids and grandkids of the original members, and their music is still loved by many fans, especially those who enjoy hip-hop music.

He rose to fame in 2006 following the success of his debut album, Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor. He also performs as the frontman of rock band Japanese Cartoon under his real name. As an entrepreneur, Fiasco is the chief executive officer of 1st and 15th Entertainment. Fiasco has since released Food & Liquor 2, as well as put work into a joint album with fellow Child Rebel Soldier & All City Chess Club member Pharrell. Prior to the album's release, he revealed that there would be no more mixtapes after \\"Friend Of The People: I Fight Evil\\" prior to Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album, which was planned to be a double-disc with Part I set to release in fall 2012. Its lead single, the Simonsayz and B-Side produced track Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free), was released on May 21, which stirred controversy from an infuriated Pete Rock for using a sample from They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.). Rock said that he felt \\"so violated\\" by the use of the sample, although the original track itself used samples from Tom Scott and James Brown. Fiasco recently collaborated with Australian singer Guy Sebastian on the single \\"Battle Scars\\". The single was recorded in Sebastian's Sydney studio when Fiasco was in Australia for Supafest, and is featured on Sebastian's album Armageddon. It debuted at number one in Australia in its first week, becoming Fiasco's first number one single.

Question: suppose there is less plant acid in the soil happens, how will it affect less virus copies made. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"No effect. Justification: 1. First, I understand the process of how a virus replicates once it has entered a host body. This process is primarily internal within the host and is not directly affected by external factors such as the soil acidity. 2. The change mentioned, i.e., less plant acid in the soil, is an external environmental change. It is known that soil acidity can impact the growth and health of plants. However, this change does not directly impact the replication process of a virus within a host body. 3. It's crucial to understand that the replication of a virus depends on its interaction with host cells, not the external environment where the host may live. 4. Therefore, I concluded 'no effect' as the soil's plant acid level would not directly affect the number of virus copies made within a host. Changes in soil acidity could potentially affect the overall health of a host organism if it's a plant but if the host is an animal or human, such changes pose no direct impact on the virus replication process. Hence, the supposed perturbation (less plant acid in the soil) would have no effect on the second effect mentioned (less virus copies made)."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Who is more likely a diabetic? Two coworkers are sitting in the large break room eating lunch and watching the news on TV when they see an advertisement for glasses. John, upon seeing the ad, comments that he really should go and get a new pair since he is nearsighted and hasn't gotten a new pair of glasses in a couple years. Rick says he is glad that he doesn't need to wear glasses because it seems like such a pain to have to always have something on your face. John nods in agreement and then both men turn to see a woman at the other side of the break room waving at them and trying to get their attention. Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided paragraph, it is not possible to definitively determine who is more likely to be diabetic between John and Rick. However, it is mentioned that nearsightedness may develop in adults due to health conditions such as diabetes.

However, this information alone is not enough to conclude which of them is more likely to be diabetic, as there could be other factors not mentioned in the paragraph that contribute to the development of diabetes."},{"instruction":"Here is a question about this article: Before printing was widely adopted in the 19th century, the Quran was transmitted in manuscripts made by calligraphers and copyists. The earliest manuscripts were written in Ḥijāzī-type script. The Hijazi style manuscripts nevertheless confirm that transmission of the Quran in writing began at an early stage. Probably in the ninth century, scripts began to feature thicker strokes, which are traditionally known as Kufic scripts. Toward the end of the ninth century, new scripts began to appear in copies of the Quran and replace earlier scripts. The reason for discontinuation in the use of the earlier style was that it took too long to produce and the demand for copies was increasing. Copyists would therefore chose simpler writing styles. Beginning in the 11th century, the styles of writing employed were primarily the naskh, muhaqqaq, rayḥānī and, on rarer occasions, the thuluth script. Naskh was in very widespread use. In North Africa and Spain, the Maghribī style was popular. More distinct is the Bihari script which was used solely in the north of India. Nastaʻlīq style was also rarely used in Persian world.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When thinking about whether a healthier lifestyle can improve well-being and decrease the risk of diseases, it's important to consider various factors such as nutrition, exercise, stress management, and sleep. By examining each of these elements, we can determine if the answer is yes. Starting with nutrition, providing the body with essential nutrients can promote growth, maintenance, and repair of bodily tissues, help balance body functions, and prevent various diseases. A well-balanced diet, including a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, is crucial in this regard. Consumption of processed foods and excessive amounts of sugar or unhealthy fats can contribute to the risk of obesity, heart diseases, diabetes, and other chronic conditions. Exercise plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental wellness, promoting proper functioning of bodily systems, maintaining a healthy weight, and enhancing mood. Studies have shown that regular physical activity can reduce the risk of heart diseases, stroke, high blood pressure, and other chronic conditions. Moreover, stress management is another essential aspect of a healthier lifestyle. High levels of stress can lead to various health problems, including weakened immune system, mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and physical ailments such as headaches, muscle tension, and heartburn. Implementing stress-relief strategies like deep breathing, meditation, mindfulness, or yoga may significantly improve well-being. Lastly, sleep is a vital component in maintaining good health. Adequate sleep is necessary for neurological and physiological processes, affecting mood regulation, memory consolidation, and immune system function. Lack of sleep can lead to an increased risk of chronic health problems such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and mental health disorders. Taking these factors into account, a healthier lifestyle - including proper nutrition, exercise, stress management, and sleep - can indeed significantly improve overall well-being and reduce the risk of diseases. Therefore, the answer to this question is yes."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"\\"Der Himmel ist klar und die Sterne leuchten in der Nacht.\\" This is a German sentence that translates to: \\"The sky is clear and the stars are shining in the night.\\" This sentence provides a beautiful image of a calm and peaceful night sky.

Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft). Paragraph: Pam and Alice studied Earth's climate and vegetation. Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S). Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person studied less about the North American Cordillera?

The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast. The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"What was the name of the contemporary source that could have been a possible influence to Eakins?\\" is Scène d'été, a painting created in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille.

Since 1994, the group has consisted of vocalist Gwen Stefani, bassist and keyboardist Tony Kanal, guitarist and keyboardist Tom Dumont, and drummer Adrian Young. Since the mid-1990s in live performances and the studio, they have been supported by keyboardist and trombonist Gabrial McNair and keyboardist and trumpeter Stephen Bradley. The ska sound of their song, \\"Trapped in a Box\\" (1992), that was featured on their first album Eric Stefani and John Spence met at a Dairy Queen and had talked about getting a group together to play music. Eric got a keyboard and gathered some players together to practice. The practice included Eric Stefani (keyboards), Gwen Stefani (backing vocals), John Spence (lead vocals), Jerry McMahon (guitar), Chris Leal (bass), Chris Webb (drums), Gabriel Gonzalez & Alan Meade (trumpet) and Tony Meade (saxophone). They practiced in Eric's parents' garage. Tony Kanal went to one of the band's early shows and soon joined the band as its bassist. After initially rejecting her advances, he began dating Gwen, but they kept their relationship secret for a year, feeling that it was an unspoken rule that no one in the band dates her. Paul Caseley (trombone) also joined the band in 1987. Eric Carpenter (saxophone) joined the horn section soon after. In December 1987, Spence committed suicide several days before the band was to play a gig at The Roxy Theatre for record industry employees. No Doubt disbanded but decided to regroup after several weeks with Alan Meade taking over vocals. When Meade left the band, Gwen replaced him as lead singer, and No Doubt continued to develop a live following in California. In early 1988, Tom Dumont left Rising, a heavy metal band of which he was a member with his sister, stating that local metal bands \\"were into drinking, wearing Spandex\\" but that he wanted to focus on music. He joined No Doubt and replaced Jerry McMahon as the band's guitarist. Adrian Young replaced Chris Webb as the drummer the following year. During this time period, No Doubt played gigs at local colleges, Fender's Grand Ballroom, The Whisky, The Roxy, many shows with The Untouchables, Fishbone, and a show with the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Cal State Long Beach. Caseley left No Doubt in July 1989 for the US Navy Band. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Sure, little buddy! So, No Doubt is like a bunch of friends who decided to make a team to play their favorite game, which is making music. Gwen Stefani is like the team captain who speaks, or sings, for the team. There are other team players too, like Tony who plays with keyboards and makes them sound like a big guitar, Tom who plays the real guitar, and Adrian, who bangs drums to make loud and fun sounds. They also have two helpers, Gabrial and Stephen, who make sounds using special machines and instruments. One of their famous games, or songs, is called \\"Trapped in a Box\\". Once upon a time, two friends, Eric and John, thought of having a music team. They added Gwen (Eric's sister), and some more friends to their team, and they practiced in Eric's parents' garage, just like how you play with your toys in your room. But then, sadly, John left them forever, so they stopped playing. After some time, they returned to the game with Gwen as their team captain. Tony who was initially just a spectator joined the team, and later began to like Gwen, a bit too much, but they kept it as a secret. Tom left another team to join No Doubt because he loved music more than wearing shiny tight clothes and partying! They played their music at many places and with other teams too. Just like different players leave and join teams, some members of No Doubt also left. But they kept playing their game, their music together! Isn't that a cool story?

The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers. The use of counting rods is one example.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"The aids mentioned in the context and bread are fundamentally different in their purpose, composition, and historical significance. To better understand the differences, let us examine each aspect individually. 1. Purpose: The primary difference between the aids and bread lies in their intended use. Aids, such as counting devices or record-keeping tools, have been developed to assist humans in computing, counting, and storing information. These aids facilitate accurate and efficient handling of various mathematical and informational tasks. For instance, tally sticks, counting rods, and calculi were designed to help people keep track of numbers and perform calculations. On the other hand, bread serves a completely different purpose. Bread is a staple food made from flour and water, typically through a process of mixing, kneading, fermentation, and baking. It is primarily consumed to provide nourishment and satiate hunger. It has been a vital part of human diets across different cultures and throughout history, acting as a fundamental source of sustenance and energy. 2. Composition: Another significant difference lies in their material composition. Aids and counting devices are generally made from non-edible materials such as wood (tally sticks), clay (calculi), and even metal or stone. These materials allow the devices to be durable, reusable, and suitable for their intended use in record-keeping processes. Bread, however, is composed of edible ingredients including flour (usually from wheat, although other grains can be used), water, and often additional components like salt, yeast, and various flavorings. These ingredients undergo chemical and physical transformations during the bread-making process, resulting in a consumable product that can be ingested by humans or animals. 3. Historical Significance: Both the aids and bread hold significant historical importance but in distinct ways. The development and use of aids in computation demonstrate the evolution of human thought, mathematical understanding, and technological advancements. These tools played a crucial role in the progress of early civilizations by aiding trade, agriculture, and administration, and they laid the groundwork for more sophisticated technologies and systems, such as the abacus and modern computing devices. Bread, on the other hand, reflects the development of agriculture, culinary practices, cultural traditions, and human survival. The cultivation of wheat and the production of bread parallel the growth of agriculture and the formation of early civilizations. Bread has been a uniting factor across cultures as a shared food staple, and its varieties and methods of preparation represent the diversity and richness of human culinary traditions. In conclusion, aids and bread differ greatly in their purpose, composition, and historical significance. Aids are designed for computation and record-keeping, while bread serves as a food source for nourishment. Aids are made from non-edible materials, whereas bread is composed of edible ingredients. Finally, the historical importance of aids lies in their contribution to human thought and technology, while bread carries significance in terms of agriculture, culinary arts, and cultural traditions."},{"instruction":"It took Alice three months to save up to buy new shoes.

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit.

The band members are known for their choreography, distinct harmonies, and flashy wardrobe. Having sold tens of millions of albums, the Temptations are one of the most successful groups in music history. Featuring five male vocalists and dancers (save for brief periods with fewer or more members), the group formed in 1960 in Detroit, Michigan under the name The Elgins. Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams started singing together in church as children. By their teenage years, they formed a doo-wop quartet in 1955 with Kell Osborne and Wiley Waller, naming themselves the Cavaliers. After Waller left the group in 1957, the remaining trio left Birmingham to break into the music business. The group settled in Detroit where they changed their name to the Primes under the direction of Milton Jenkins. The Primes soon became well known around the Detroit area for their meticulous performances. Jenkins later created a sister group, The Primettes, later known as the Supremes. Kendricks was already seen as a \\"matinee idol\\" in the Detroit area while Williams was well received for his baritone vocals. Texas teenager Otis Williams moved to Detroit as a youngster to be with his mother. By 1958, Williams was the leader of a vocal group named Otis Williams and the Siberians. The group included Elbridge \\"Al\\" Bryant, James \\"Pee-Wee\\" Crawford, Vernard Plain and Arthur Walton. The group recorded a song, \\"Pecos Kid\\" for a label run by radio deejay Senator Bristol Bryant. Shortly after its release, the group changed its name to The El Domingoes. Following this, Montgomery native Melvin Franklin replaced Arthur Walton as bass vocalist and Detroit-born Richard Street (claimed by Melvin Franklin to be his cousin) replaced Vernard Plain as lead singer. Signing with Johnnie Mae Matthews' Northern Records, the group had their name changed again to The Distants. The group recorded two Northern singles including \\"Come On\\" (1959) and \\"Alright\\" (1960). Between these releases, Albert \\"Mooch\\" Harrell replaced Pee-Wee Crawford. \\"Come On\\" became a local hit and the Warwick Records label picked the record up for national distribution. Following the release of \\"Alright\\", Matthews appointed Williams the group leader, and the group's name was changed to Otis Williams & The Distants. During this period, both the Primes and Distants were influenced by other vocal groups including the Miracles. Other inspirations included the Cadillacs, Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, the Drifters, and the Isley Brothers. Though \\"Come On\\" was a local hit in the Detroit area, the Distants never saw much record sales and \\"Alright\\" was not as successful. After receiving an offer from Berry Gordy to sign with Motown Records, the Distants got out of their contract with Northern Records. However, Mooch Harrell and Richard Street shortly departed from the group and the remaining members lost use of the Distants name. Richard Street later formed another Distants group who recorded for the Thelma label in the early 1960s.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","output":"No, the information provided does not directly answer the question about Coca-Cola's effects on nausea and vomiting. Instead, the answer provided is a generic description of Coca-Cola and its availability in countries worldwide. A more appropriate answer to the question would be: Coca-Cola, due to its carbonation and specific combination of ingredients, is believed to have some mild effects on relieving nausea and vomiting. The carbonation can help soothe an upset stomach, while the sugar content in the drink may provide calories and gentle stimulation for nauseous individuals who have difficulty consuming other foods. There is some anecdotal evidence that flat or slightly flat Coca-Cola may be more effective for this purpose because it is less carbonated and would be less likely to cause excess gas and bloating. However, it is important to note that consuming Coca-Cola is not a universally accepted or clinically proven remedy for nausea and vomiting. Individuals who experience severe and persistent symptoms should consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, consuming excessive amounts of sugar and caffeine, as present in Coca-Cola, may not be suitable for people with certain health conditions or dietary restrictions. It is always best to consult with a healthcare professional to ensure the appropriate treatment for nausea and vomiting."},{"instruction":"Calendarul următoarelor şedinţe: a se vedea procesul-verbal Could you please translate this to English?","output":"I will now translate the given text from Romanian to English step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the language to be certain it is Romanian.

To take advantage of Ava's dynastic succession crisis, Razadarit invaded Upper Burma in full force with a large flotilla in 1401. Ava's defenses held, and Razadarit and Minkhaung I of Ava agreed to another truce in 1403. The second truce lasted less than 5 years as Ava quickly went on an expansion spree, swallowing up Shan states of Kale and Mohnyin in the north, and Arakan in the west, between 1404 and 1406. Pegu could not allow Ava to get too strong, and renewed the war. In 1408, Peguan forces dislodged Avan troops from Arakan. Pegu also found an ally in the Shan state of Theinni , which too wanted to check Ava's ambitions. Between 1408 and 1413, Ava was forced to fight on multiple fronts: Theinni in the north, and Pegu in the south and in the west . Nonetheless, by 1412, Avan forces, led by Crown Prince Minye Kyawswa, had begun to gain an upper hand. Minye Kyawswa defeated Theinni and its Chinese allies in 1412. He invaded the Hanthawaddy country in full force in 1414, and conquered the Irrawaddy delta in 1415, forcing Razadarit to flee Pegu for Martaban. But Minye Kyawswa was killed in battle in March 1415.

The Liberal Party is conservative, but the communications minister is known for his progressive views, notably his support for climate change action and gay marriage. Those views are unpopular among the more right-wing members of the party, and some are unconvinced that Mr Turnbull will stick to core party policies. The question of internal support has become more crucial in recent months. Amid plummeting support for Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Mr Turnbull had been touted as a strong contender to replace him. Polls conducted by research company Ipsos Australia, including the latest done in August 2015, had consistently found him to be the most preferred person to be the Liberal leader and prime minister, over Mr Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. In February, Mr Turnbull was widely expected to challenge the leadership, but the Liberal party voted not to open up Mr Abbott's position to challengers. A successful former lawyer and businessman, Mr Turnbull is now one of the richest politicians in Australia, having made the Business Review Weekly Rich 200 List several times. Raised by a single parent, he grew up in the Vaucluse and Double Bay neighbourhoods of Sydney. He attended a state school as a child and later received a scholarship to attend a private high school. After studying law at the University of Sydney, he won a Rhodes scholarship to further his studies at Oxford University. Mr Turnbull briefly worked as a journalist for several outlets, including The Sunday Times in the UK, before embarking on his law career. One of his biggest achievements was defending former British spy Peter Wright in the \\"Spycatcher\\" case in the 1980s. Mr Wright wrote a memoir about his time in MI5, and the British government sought to ban its publication in the UK. Mr Turnbull successfully overturned the ban. He went into the technology business in the 1990s, and co-founded one of the biggest Australian internet service providers at that time, OzEmail. In 2004, Mr Turnbull was elected as the MP for Wentworth, the electoral seat where he grew up and where he continues to live with his wife Lucy Hughes, who was the first female Lord Mayor of Sydney. He quickly rose through the parliamentary and party ranks, serving on various committees. He was briefly the environment and water resources minister in John Howard's government before his party's coalition lost to Labor in the 2007 federal election. He was elected as leader of the opposition in 2008, but a year later faced two leadership challenges, losing the second one narrowly to Mr Abbott by just a single vote. Mr Turnbull's downfall was attributed to his views on climate change and support for an emissions trading scheme. However, his credibility was also severely damaged when he attacked then-PM Kevin Rudd over an email purportedly showing corruption, but which was later found to have been faked by a top civil servant. The so-called \\"OzCar\\" affair damaged his standing with his colleagues and the public. In his current role as the communications minister, Mr Turnbull earned plaudits for doing his job well and having a good grasp of public policy. He is also known as a skilled orator and debater. Dr Peter John Chen, a politics lecturer at the University of Sydney, says: \\"He has the hallmarks of an effective leader... But he is not greatly loved by his party, because he tends to be on the left while his party is moving towards the right.\\" Mr Turnbull is also known for his tendency to be abrasive with colleagues; he has for instance previously publicly blasted Mr Abbott's climate change plan. Mr Turnbull has also been criticised for failing to consult with his colleagues before announcing his position on issues, such as his support for an apology to Australia's indigenous \\"Stolen Generation\\". Dr Sally Young, associate professor of politics at the University of Melbourne, says Mr Turnbull is \\"more of his own man\\", describing him as \\"less intimidated\\" by powerful media baron Rupert Murdoch.","output":"Mr. Turnbull is a well-liked person who is good at talking to people. He is part of a conservative political party, but he has some more progressive views, like caring about the environment and supporting marriage between any two people who love each other. Some people in his party don't like this, and wondered if he would follow the party's rules. People started thinking that Mr. Turnbull could become the leader of the party and the Prime Minister of Australia because they weren't too happy with the current Prime Minister, Mr. Abbott. Mr. Turnbull was a lawyer and a businessman before becoming a politician, and he has a lot of money and success. Mr. Turnbull grew up with only one parent and went to good schools, even getting a special scholarship to study at a private school and later study abroad. He worked as a journalist and a lawyer, before starting his own technology business. He then became a politician and quickly moved up in the ranks of his political party. People like Mr. Turnbull's ability to talk and understand big ideas, but some within his party don't love him because he has more progressive views. Sometimes he gets upset with his colleagues and doesn't ask their opinions before making decisions. But many think he can be an effective leader."},{"instruction":"Love, love, love my OTF workouts!

Lately, he has been studying the possibility of extraterrestrial life and working tirelessly to find a way to communicate with potential life forms. While working late in his lab one night, Professor Huxley accidentally creates a makeshift radio out of spare parts and equipment. Intrigued by its potential, he decides to send out coded messages across space in an attempt to see if anybody or anything will respond. Weeks pass, and when all hope seems to be lost, suddenly a series of unexplained occurrences start happening around the town. Anomaly in the weather patterns, livestock disappearing, and mysterious shadows lurking behind every corner have the townsfolk on edge. Professor Huxley and his gifted student, Sarah, begin to investigate these strange occurrences. As the anomalies escalate, they suspect that someone - or something - has received their message and is attempting to establish communication. As they continue their research, Professor Huxley and Sarah find an encrypted code within the strange static of the makeshift radio. Working together, they manage to decipher the message, which reveals the coordinates of a remote location in the nearby woods. Driven by curiosity and a burning desire to uncover the truth, Professor Huxley and Sarah venture into the forest, only to find an extraterrestrial spacecraft hidden amongst the trees. Within the craft, they encounter a lost alien being who has been trapped on Earth after responding to Huxley's signal. Professor Huxley, Sarah, and the alien team up to find a solution to send their newfound friend back to its home planet. As they work together, they also uncover clues about a secretive government organization that has been tracking and hunting extraterrestrial creatures on Earth for years. While Professor Huxley and Sarah struggle to protect the alien and help it return to its home planet, they must simultaneously evade the relentless pursuit of the government agents, led by the sinister and ruthless Agent Maddox. In a thrilling confrontation, Professor Huxley and Sarah manage to outsmart the government agency, enabling the alien to safely leave Earth and return home. In a bittersweet farewell, the alien departs but not before vowing to maintain communication with the humans who have helped it. With their lives forever changed, Professor Huxley and Sarah return to their normal routines, but they continue to push the boundaries of scientific research and space exploration. Their experiences reinforce the importance of fostering understanding and friendship between different species across the cosmos. The makeshift radio serves as a crucial reminder that sometimes the answers to life's greatest mysteries can stem from the most unexpected sources."},{"instruction":"What is the missing first step of the following process: - Air enters bronchioles - Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale.

Halfway down the block, a low-slung building covered in gray siding sits behind a security fence. Knowing what’s inside the little structure helps explain the street’s unusual name. It’s the top-secret corporate test kitchen for In-N-Out Burger, the iconic West Coast chain. Lynsi Snyder, the company’s billionaire president, hovers over a set of double fryers and stove-top griddles. “To be honest, I don’t come here a whole lot,” she says. Given the clean counters and neatly tucked-away cooking utensils, it doesn’t look like anyone comes here often. Which is probably not far off the mark. While McDonald’s and Burger King serve well over 80 different items, In-N-Out famously serves fewer than 15: burgers, cheeseburgers, fries, soda, milk shakes and the signature two-patty Double-Double. Snyder has added just one thing: hot chocolate in 2018. The company will make tweaks from time to time, like switching to a premium Kona coffee and healthier sunflower oil for cooking fries. The October 31, 2018 issue of Forbes featuring In-N-Out's Lynsi Snyder. But Snyder, who at 36 debuts on this year’s Forbes 400 as its youngest woman, with a net worth of 3 billion, fiercely embraces an imperviousness to change. “It’s not [about] adding new products. Or thinking of the next bacon-wrapped this or that. We’re making the same burger, the same fry,” says Snyder, wearing black lace-up combat boots and stacks of silver bracelets on both arms. “We’re really picky and strategic. We’re not going to compromise.” In-N-Out is a culinary anachronism. It hasn’t evolved much since Snyder’s grandparents founded it in 1948. Buns are baked with slow-rising dough each morning. Three central facilities grind all the (never-frozen) meat, delivering daily to the 333 restaurants. Nearly all its locations are in California, and all are company owned. (In-N-Out does not franchise.) Heat lamps, microwaves and freezers are banned from the premises. The recipes for its burgers and fries have remained essentially the same for 70 years. Consistency has earned it a passionate following. In-N-Out has become a fixture at Oscars after-parties. Its secret menu, like the option to order a burger “protein style”—lettuce leaves, no bun—is the least well-kept secret since the WikiLeaks cables. Top chefs like Gordon Ramsay, David Chang and Thomas Keller are all enthusiastic fans. The actor-cum-rapper Donald Glover has rhapsodized about In-N-Out in his lyrics. And in 2006 Paris Hilton got a DUI because, as she later explained, “I was just really hungry, and I wanted to have an In-N-Out burger.” “They have a loyalty and an enthusiasm for the brand that very, very few restaurants can ever obtain,” says Robert Woolway, who handles restaurant deals for the L.A.-based investment bank FocalPoint Partners. That loyalty is lucrative. An In-N-Out store outsells a typical McDonald’s nearly twice over, bringing in an estimated 4.5 million in gross annual sales versus McDonald’s 2.6 million. (In-N-Out, which is private, won’t comment on its financials.) In-N-Out’s profit margin (measured by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is an estimated 20%. That’s higher than In-N-Out’s East Coast rival Shake Shack (16%) and other restaurant chains that typically own their locations, like Chipotle (10.5%). Revenue should surpass 1 billion this year, roughly doubling in eight years, and the business is debt-free, according to the company. In-N-Out is conservatively worth 3 billion, and Snyder now owns virtually all of it after receiving chunks on her 25th, 30th and 35th birthdays (she got the last slice in 2017). Snyder is an unlikely shepherd of her family’s business. By all rights, her uncle should be running In-N-Out, if not for his untimely death. She never graduated from college and lost her father to drug abuse. As a young woman, she battled through a period of alcohol and drug use and three di­vorces. Snyder, a devout Christian who sports tattoos of Bible ­verses, came out of those experiences drawn to In-N-Out’s long-standing stability—determined to change the company as little as possible, particularly the brand’s image of 1950s wholesomeness. After taking over in 2010, she embarked on a slow, steady expansion across the West, opening more than 80 stores in the same period that Five Guys, a close competitor, added more than 500 across America. “I felt a deep call to make sure that I preserve those things that [my family] would want. That we didn’t ever look to the left and the right to see what everyone else is doing, cut corners or change things drastically or compromise,” says Snyder, who has spoken with the media only a handful of times. “I really wanted to make sure that we stayed true to what we started with. That required me to become a protector. A guardian.” I n 1948, Harry and Esther Snyder, Lynsi’s grandparents, opened the first In-N-Out, in Baldwin Park. It had no indoor seating, so Harry installed a two-way speaker box connected to the kitchen, creating an early drive-thru window. As Americans flooded the new U.S. highway system, In-N-Out, which was placing its restaurants alongside the new roads, took off. In southern California, In-N-Outs became a hangout for hot rod racers. From the early days, Harry and Esther were keen to keep as many aspects of the business in-house as they could. They butchered their own meat, started a wholesaling firm to stock up on paper supplies and used their own construction crew to build new stores. In-N-Out grew gradually, reaching 18 locations, all in California, by the time Harry died in 1976. His younger son, Rich, took his spot; the elder son, Guy, Lynsi’s father, had been passed over. He had an ongoing problem with opioids after a motorcycle accident left him with chronic pain. He spent his days away from the company, drag racing or on his 115-acre ranch in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, where Lynsi grew up. In December 1993, Rich flew to see his niece Lynsi in a play at a ­private Christian school and then continued on to the opening of store No. 93 in Fresno, California. On the way home, the ten-passenger plane crashed, leaving no survivors. After his death, Esther became president, and Guy, who had separated from Lynsi’s mother earlier that year, took over as executive vice president and chairman. During Guy’s six years as chairman, In-N-Out grew to 140 stores, with over 200 million in revenue. Yet he struggled personally. On Christmas Day 1995 he was arrested for public intoxication and illegally carrying a loaded firearm, which he had along with a switchblade knife and marijuana. Over the next few years he survived a drug-related heart attack and three drug overdoses before dying of heart failure (with hydrocodone in his system) in December 1999, at age 48. “When he was sober, he was the best dad in the world. We had our time cut short,” says Lynsi, who has a scroll with the words “Daddy’s Girl” tattooed on her right shoulder. Before her father died, Lynsi had worked for a few months at an In-N-Out in Redding, California, separating leaves of lettuce and working the register. Soon after, the 18-year-old married and moved close to the company’s headquarters in Baldwin Park to take a job at In-N-Out’s corporate merchandising department, approving projects like T-shirt designs. Lynsi fell into a year-long stretch of alcohol and marijuana use, and she and her husband divorced after a few years. A second short-lived marriage followed. “It was like a black-sheep era of my life,” she says. “By the time I hit 22, it was pretty much over.” Lynsi rotated through departments at In-N-Out to learn the business. As Lynsi educated herself on how it worked, Esther, then in her 80s, ran day-to-day operations. Then Esther died too, in 2006. Mark Taylor, a longtime In-N-Out executive (who is also Lynsi’s brother-in-law), became company president, turning over the role to Lynsi in 2010. At age 27, Lynsi was running In-N-Out, which was generating an estimated 550 million in sales at 251 locations. Her third marriage came soon after, this time to a race car driver. (It’s in the blood: Lynsi also drag races competitively.) They divorced in 2014, followed by her fourth marriage. “The things that I’ve been through forced me to be stronger,” she says. “When you persevere, you end up developing more strength.” I n In-N-Out restaurant is a time capsule. The red-and-white color scheme hasn’t changed since the 1950s, and the chrome tables and vinyl chairs are poodle-skirt-era throwbacks. Palm trees are a frequent motif—printed on the company’s plates, painted onto restaurant walls—a nod both to In-N-Out’s California roots and to Grandpa Snyder’s favorite movie, It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, from 1963. Bible verse numbers have appeared on burger wrappers and cups since 1985, and Snyder has added two more: Proverbs 24:16 (for those unfamiliar: “ ... the wicked shall fall into mischief”) to the fries container and Luke 6:35 (“But love ye your enemies, and do good”) to coffee cups. Over the past 30 years, the price of the Double-Double hasn’t even kept up with inflation. In 1989 the sandwich cost 2.15, or about 4.40 in current dollars. It costs 3.85 today. A combo meal (Double-Double, fries, drink) goes for 7.30, compared with 10.94 for Shake Shack’s standard double-burger patty and fries. So how does In-N-Out maintain its margins? To start, the limited menu means reduced costs for raw ingredients. The company also saves money by buying wholesale and grinding the beef in-house. By doing its own sourcing and distribution, it likely saves 3% to 5% in food costs a year. It cuts out an estimated 6% to 10% of total costs by owning most of its properties—many bought years ago—and not paying rent. In-N-Out picks its locations carefully, clustering them near one another and close to highways to lower delivery costs while also avoiding pricey urban cores. It has just one location within the city limits of Los Angeles and one in San Francisco, while many Shake Shacks are smack in the center of town. While much has stayed the same at In-N-Out, Snyder has made some changes. She moved the company into Texas for the first time in 2011 and into Oregon four years later. Last November, In-N-Out announced it would expand to Colorado—once it finishes building a new regional headquarters and a patty-making facility there, likely by 2020. New Mexico may be next, a few years after Colorado, Snyder says, since the new supply center is nearby. Snyder still abides by the long-standing In-N-Out rule that all new restaurants fall within a day’s drive from the nearest warehouse, so meat and other ingredients stay fresh. “I don’t see us stretched across the whole U.S. I don’t see us in every state. Take Texas—draw a line up and just stick to the left. That’s in my lifetime,” Snyder says. “I like that we’re sought after when someone’s coming into town. I like that we’re unique. That we’re not on every corner. You put us in every state and it takes away some of its luster.” No matter where In-N-Out goes, it has to deal with competitors with entrenched positions. In Texas it faces 68-year-old Whataburger. The 2-billion-in-revenue company has 674 locations in the Lone Star State—In-N-Out has just 36 there—after opening 116 more in Texas since In-N-Out came in. “Certainly we’d love for them to go somewhere else. But they’re welcome to compete,” says Preston Atkinson, Whataburger’s CEO. “They’re doing something different than we are. In-N-Out has got a limited menu.” But In-N-Out is betting that its small number of offerings and higher-­quality food will help win over ­Whataburger customers. It has launched a highway billboard campaign outside Dallas—where ­Whataburger has 20% of its stores—with the tag­line “No Microwaves, No Freezers, No Heat Lamps.” On its California home turf, In-N-Out must defend against incursions. Shake Shack, the popular 359-million-in-sales burger chain founded by the New York restaurateur Danny Meyer, has come west, opening nine locations in southern California during the last two years, with plans to open three in the Bay Area starting this fall. Shake Shack burgers, made with meat from the famous high-end butcher Pat LaFrieda and served on potato-bread buns from Martin’s, have their own loyal following. “We wanted to bring our own spin to California,” says Andrew McCaughan, Shake Shack’s vice president of development. “It’s absolutely a key market for us, and we continue to really want to invest deeper and deeper in the market.” At In-N-Out, Snyder’s “goals are not for us to be the biggest,” says executive vice president Bob Lang, a 45-year In-N-Out veteran. “Really, it’s about maintaining the legacy of her family and a family environment.” Snyder is popular with her 26,000 employees. She has a 99% approval rating on Glassdoor.com, the job-reviews site, and is ranked No. 4. on a 2018 Glassdoor list of top bosses at large companies, ahead of CEOs like LinkedIn’s Jeff Weiner, Salesforce’s Marc Benioff and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella. In-N-Out and Snyder get high marks for a reason: good pay and career development. Restaurant workers, or “associates” in In-N-Out speak, make 13 an hour, versus the 9 to 10 or so that’s typical at most national competitors, including McDonald’s and Burger King. Part- and full-time restaurant workers can enroll in dental, vision and life insurance plans through the company, and full-timers can get health insurance and paid vacation, accruing time off after two weeks of employment. The average In-N-Out manager has been with the company for 17 years and makes 163,000, more than the typical California dentist, accountant or financial advisor. Managers get profit-sharing, too. “They’re simulating an ownership mentality at the restaurant,” says John Glass, a restaurant-industry equity analyst at Morgan Stanley. “That manager now has skin in the game.” O ne idea has been firmly held in the minds of the Snyders. It might as well be the family motto: The company isn’t for sale. Back when he was chairman, Rich Snyder summed up the thought of selling In-N-Out this way: “I would be prostituting what my parents made by doing that,” he told Forbes in 1989. “There is money to be made by doing those things, but you lose something, and I don’t want to lose what I was raised with all my life.” Over the course of a month, Lynsi Snyder routinely gets offers to take In-N-Out public or sell. “We’ve had some pretty crazy offers,” says Snyder. “There’s been, like, princes and different people throwing some big numbers at us where I’m like, ‘Really?’ ” The plan never changes. “We will continue to politely say no to Wall Street or to the Saudi princes. Whoever will come,” says Arnie Wensinger, In-N-Out’s longtime general counsel. The idea of an In-N-Out IPO leaves bankers like Damon Chandik, the head of Piper Jaffray’s restaurant M&A team, salivating. “I get calls all the time on In-N-Out. It would be the hottest IPO out there,” he says. “I admire her and the whole company for not going down the path. You do have that risk of ultimately changing the culture of the business.” Given the investor appetite for Shake Shack, whose stock trades at almost 100 times earnings, a public offering would undoubtedly hand In-N-Out tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars in working capital—and give Snyder a way to cash out part of her stake in the business. “It’s not about the money for us,” she says. “Unless God sends a lightning bolt down and changes my heart miraculously, I would not ever sell.” Reach Chloe Sorvino at csorvino@forbes.com.

In a new interview with Forbes, the extremely private owner and president of In-N-Out, touches on losing her father to drug abuse, her own battle with addiction and her complicated love life. While her father, Guy, headed up the West Coast burger chain for six years in the 1990s, he was arrested for public intoxication, suffered from a drug-related heart attack and three drug overdoses, according to Forbes. He was in an out of rehab since Snyder was 5 or 6 years old, but died of heart failure with hydrocodone in his system in 1999. “When he was sober, he was the best dad in the world,” she says. “We had our time cut short.” Soon after his death, Synder tells the magazine for their Forbes 400 cover story that she entered into “year-long stretch of alcohol and marijuana use.” At the time she married her high school sweetheart, Jeremiah Seawell, but the pair divorced after two years and she quickly entered into a doomed marriage with her second husband Richard Martinez. “It was like a black-sheep era of my life,” she says. “By the time I hit 22, it was pretty much over.” RELATED: Ina Garten Reveals the Only Fast Food She’ll Eat: ‘It Was Julia Child’s Favorite Too’ After going through two more divorces, Synder met her current husband, Sean Ellingson.

That might be why the movie The Martian (<<>> ) is so popular. It shows an astronaut struggling to live on Mars. But would it actually be possible to live on the Red Planet? While the idea of living on Mars is great, the reality does not look as good. Mars does not have a friendly atmosphere for humans. There is very little oxygen there. And because of its distance from the sun, it is also very cold. The temperature on Mars can be -62 degrees on average. This is much too cold for humans. However, scientists say it might be possible to live there even without a good atmosphere. Daytime on Mars is almost the same as Earth's. It means there's enough sunlight to grow plants inside safe buildings. However, they would have to grow in soil from Earth. Mars does not have a strong enough atmosphere to stop the radiation coming from space, which makes it dangerous to grow things in the soil. The radiation is also bad for our health. If we want to live there healthily, we need to build our homes under the ground or within the rocks on the planet. This would protect humans from the radiation and also some heat. When could we actually live on Mars? NASA is hoping to make some progress within the next 20 years.

Golden Monkeys Golden monkeys are mainly found in Sichuan, Gansu, Shanxi provinces and Shengnongjia mountainous area of Hubei Province. Golden monkeys have golden-orange fur. They move around in the daytime, usually in groups of as many as 100 to 200 heads, or 20 to 30 heads. They feed on fruits and young leaves of bamboos. But people are destroying the environment where they live. Trees and bamboos are disappearing, so golden monkeys have less and less to eat. Elephans ks5u Elephants are very big and strong.

It didn't take long for the SAG Awards to get political Sunday night. When Ashton Kutcher took the stage to introduce the show, he welcomed the crowd \\"and everyone in airports that belong in my America!\\" he said to applause from the audience. \\"You are part of the fabric of who we are, and we we love you and we welcome you.\\" \\"We also welcome you to the 23rd annual Screen Actors Guild Awards...\\" he joked. Several award winners also addressed President Donald Trump's controversial executive order and immigration ban in their acceptance speeches. Protests continued Sunday across the country against Trump's immigration and travel ban, with demonstrations at LAX in Los Angeles, JFK in New York, Dulles in Washington and Logan Airport in Boston gaining support. L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti was reportedly part of the group at LAX to demonstrate in support of travelers being detained from countries on the banned list, which includes Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lybia, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen. Upon winning best actress in a comedy series for HBO's Veep, Julia Louis-Dreyfus joked that whether the Russians \\"did or did not hack\\" this awards show, \\"this award is legitimate and I won. I'm the winner, the winner is me. Landslide!\\" The actress added that she is \\"horrified\\" by the immigrant ban, being the child of an immigrant. \\"My father fled religious persecution in Nazi-occupied France,\\" she said. \\"I am American patriot. I love this country and because I love this country, I am horrified by its blemishes. And this immigrant ban is a blemish and it is un-American.\\" Accepting his award for best actor in a comedy series, Shameless' William H. Macy said he'd actually like to \\"thank President Trump for making Frank Gallagher seem so normal.\\" Speaking for the cast of Orange Is the New Black, who won best ensemble in a comedy series, Taylor Schilling spoke about Trump's immigration ban: \\"We stand up here representing a diverse group of people, representing generations of families who have sought a better life here,\\" Schilling said, as castmembers shouted out their countries of origin. \\"We know that it's going to be up to us and all of you to keep telling stories. What united us is stronger than the forces that seek to divide us.\\" Upon winning the SAG Award for best male actor in a supporting role for Moonlight, Mahershala Ali delivered a powerful speech about being a Muslim in America. He told the crowd, \\"When we get caught up in the minutiae and the details that make us all different, I think there's two ways of seeing that.

Macy poses in the press room with the award for outstanding performance by a male actor in a comedy series for \\"Shameless\\" at the 23rd annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at the Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall on Sunday, Jan. 29, 2017, in Los Angeles. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) (Associated Press) Oscar season is looking more and more like one very well-dressed protest against President Donald Trump. In speech after fiery speech at Sunday night's Screen Actors Guild Awards, winners struck a defiant tone against Trump's sweeping immigration ban. Their words varied from tender personal reflections to full-throated battle cries, but they were nearly uniform in channeling the nationwide demonstrations sparked by Trump's halting of immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations. The SAG Awards culminated with the evening's top honor, best movie ensemble, going to the cast of \\"Hidden Figures,\\" an uplifting drama about African-American mathematicians who aided NASA's 1960s space race, starring Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae and Octavia Spencer. Henson concluded the show the same way its first presenter, Ashton Kutcher, began it: with the kind of pointed politics that have traditionally been more an aberration than a constant at Hollywood award shows. \\"This story is about unity,\\" said Henson, who stars alongside Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae in \\"Hidden Figures.\\" ''This story is about what happens when we put our differences aside and we come together as a human race. We win. Love wins. Every time.\\" It was a surprise win for \\"Hidden Figures.\\" With the Oscar front-runner \\"La La Land\\" (which took the Producers Guild Awards' top honor on Saturday) not nominated in the category, most expected a contest between \\"Moonlight\\" or \\"Manchester by the Sea.\\" Such a result could now mean \\"Hidden Figures\\" is the strongest challenger to the \\"La La Land\\" dominance, or, perhaps, that none of the three films will be able to muster enough to topple the song-and-dance juggernaut. Yet if Damien Chazelle's musical is to go on to win best picture, it will be just the second film to do so without a SAG ensemble nod in the category's history. Only Mel Gibson's \\"Braveheart\\" managed it in 1996. But such Oscar handicapping — usually the prime drama at the SAG Awards — largely took a backseat to politics on Sunday. (That is, with the possible exception of Denzel Washington's surprise win over Casey Affleck.) Whichever film ultimately triumphs at the Oscars, it seems assured of being dwarfed by the growing off-screen clamor. The immigration ban has already altered the Academy Awards. On Sunday, the revered Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, whose \\"A Salesman\\" is nominated for best foreign language film, said he would boycott the Oscars, even if he was allowed to travel for them. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who added another honor for her performance on the political satire \\"Veep,\\" said she was the daughter of an immigrant who fled religious persecution in Nazi-occupied France. \\"Because I love this country, I am horrified by its blemishes,\\" said Louis-Dreyfus. \\"And this immigrant ban is a blemish and it is un-American.\\" Perhaps the most moving speech came from Mahershala Ali, who won best supporting actor for his acclaimed performance in Barry Jenkins' coming-of-age portrait, \\"Moonlight.\\" Ali said the film, about a shy, gay Miami boy's hard life, held lessons of acceptance. \\"We see what happens when you persecute people,\\" Ali said. \\"The fold into themselves.\\" Ali said his own relationship with his mother exemplified tolerance. The son of a Protestant minister, Ali converted to Islam 17 years ago. \\"We put things to the side,\\" Ali said of their differences. \\"I'm able to see her. She's able to see me. We love each other. The love has grown. That stuff is minutia.

The 23rd annual Screen Actors Guild Awards were nothing if not consistent. SEE ALSO: Winona Ryder experienced every human emotion on stage at the SAGs Whether scathing or subtle, just about everyone who took the stage Sunday night to collect an award had something to say about the #MuslimBan — starting with the red carpet and lasting all the way to the final speech. Here are all 12 times the issue was addressed on the telecast: Ashton Kutcher Ashton Kutcher was first to speak at the 23rd annual Screen Actors Guild Awards. Image: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP The SAG Awards don't have an emcee, per se, but the That '70s Show actor was the first famous face we saw, and he jumped right on it: Good evening fellow SAG/AFTRA members, and everyone at home, and everyone in airports that belong in my America. You are a part of the fabric of who we are, and we love you and we welcome you. Julia Louis-Dreyfus Julia Louis-Dreyfus accepting at the 23rd annual Screen Actors Guild Awards.

I am the winner. The winner is me. Landslide. To a less insane note ... I want you all to know that I am the daughter of an immigrant.

Mahershala Ali Mahershala Ali doesn't want anyone folding into themselves. Image: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP Ali won Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role for Moonlight, then launched into an emotional plea: What I’ve learned from working on Moonlight is, uh, we see what happens when we persecute people. They fold into themselves. And what was so great about having the opportunity to play Juan was playing a gentleman folding into himself as a result of persecution by his community, and taking that opportunity to uplift him and tell him that he mattered, and that he was OK, and accept him. ... I hope we do a better job of that. We kinda get caught up in the minutiae, the details that make us all different; I think there’s two ways of seeing that. There’s an opportunity to see the texture of that person, to see the characteristics that make them unique. And then there’s the opportunity to go to war about it. And to say that person is different form me and I don’t like you. Let’s battle. My mother is an ordained minister. I’m a Muslim. She didn’t do backflips when I called to tell her I converted 17 years ago. But I tell you now: We put things to the side. And I’m able to see her, and she’s able to see me. We love each other, the love is grown. Sarah Paulson Sarah Paulson and her guest — Marcia Clark herself — arrive at the 23rd annual Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Johnson — and felt like he gained an understanding of the former president in the process: How would Lyndon Johnson think about Donald Trump?

So much to do, global warming, Standing Rock, LBGT issues, Chinese missiles ... David Harbour Police Chief Jim Hopper is hoppin' all right. Image: AP Police Chief Jim Hopper wound up and let rip with this speech — just 20 words shy of the Gettysburg Address — after Stranger Things won Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series: I would just like to say, in light of all that's going on in the world today, it's difficult to celebrate the already celebrated Stranger Things, but this award, from you who take your craft seriously and earnestly believe, like me, that great acting can change the world is a call to arms from our fellow craftsmen and women to go deeper. And through our art to battle against fear, self-centeredness and exclusivity of our predominately narcissistic culture, and through our craft to cultivate a more empathetic and understanding society by revealing intimate truths that serve as a forceful reminder to folks that when they feel broken and afraid and tired they are not alone. We are united in that we are all human beings and we are all together on this horrible, painful, joyous, exciting and mysterious ride that is being alive. Now, as we act in the continuing narrative of 'Stranger Things,' we 1983 midwesterners will repel bullies. We will shelter freaks and outcasts, those who have no home. We will get past the lies. We will hunt monsters and when we are at a loss amidst the hypocrisy and the casual violence of certain individuals and institutions, we will, as per Chief Jim Hopper, punch some people in the face when they seek to destroy the weak and the disenfranchised and the marginalized. And we will do it all with soul, with heart, and with joy. We thank you for this responsibility. Thank you. Alia Shawkat Alia Shawkat (right) had a special greeting for the SAG Awards.

Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \\"God Only Knows\\". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \\"Blue Jean\\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \\"Dancing in the Street\\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \\"This Is Not America\\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \\"Absolute Beginners\\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits \\"Day-In, Day-Out\\" (his 60th single), \\"Time Will Crawl\\", and \\"Never Let Me Down\\". Bowie later described it as his \\"nadir\\", calling it \\"an awful album\\". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although years after the tour's conclusion, critics acknowledged that the tour influenced how other artists performed concerts, including...

The cats come running into the kitchen when they hear the electric can opener. Now, each time Jake's mother opens a can of corn, the cats come running. This is an example of","output":"This is an example of classical conditioning. Step 1: Identifying the key components of classical conditioning in the situation - Unconditioned Stimulus (US): The food from a can, as it naturally evokes a response from the cats. - Unconditioned Response (UR): The cats coming running for food, which is a natural response to the US. - Conditioned Stimulus (CS): The sound of the electric can opener, as it becomes associated with the US through the conditioning process. - Conditioned Response (CR): The cats coming running upon hearing the sound of the can opener, even when it opens a can of corn. Step 2: Describing the process of classical conditioning Classical conditioning, also known as Pavlovian conditioning, is a learning process in which a neutral stimulus comes to elicit a response after being paired with a stimulus that naturally evokes a response. In this case: 1) Initially, the cats respond only to the unconditioned stimulus (food from a can), and the electric can opener sound is a neutral stimulus, not triggering any response. 2) After repeated pairing of the conditioned stimulus (the sound of the electric can opener) with the unconditioned stimulus (food from a can), the cats begin to associate the sound of the can opener with receiving food. 3) As a result, the conditioned stimulus (the sound of the electric can opener) alone is now capable of evoking the conditioned response (cats coming running), even when the unconditioned stimulus (food from a can) is not present, as demonstrated when Jake's mother opens a can of corn. In conclusion, this situation is an example of classical conditioning, as the cats have learned to associate the sound of the electric can opener with receiving food, and they now come running even when the can opener is used for a different purpose (i.e., opening a can of corn)."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

When their car gets a flat Woody goes to find a gas station. Their friends Becky (Tanya Roberts), Jerry (Jon Van Ness) and Molly (Jocelyn Jones) are traveling separately in a different vehicle. They reach Eileen waiting at the car and they all drive off to collect Woody. Woody has found a gas station but it appears deserted. He enters the back room but becomes trapped. Various mannequins appear in the room, and multiple objects fly at him until a metal pipe impales and kills him. The others find a tourist trap and conclude Woody is there. As they drive in, their vehicle mysteriously breaks down. Jerry tries to fix his jeep and the girls go skinny dipping in a nearby oasis.

Nearing the end of his shift, the young cashier displayed a blend of relief and gratitude as the manager settled in to take over. The manager greeted the cashier with a smile, commending him for his commitment and dedication during the long hours of relentless work. They began the standard procedure of counting the cash drawer together, ensuring all was in order, while exchanging stories from their day. The cashier recounted an encounter with a particularly difficult customer who had vehemently insisted on speaking with the manager earlier in the day. Evidently, they were on opposite sides of the store when the incident occurred; however, the cashier had successfully managed to calm the situation, displaying not only a deep understanding of customer service but also an unwavering sense of responsibility. Feeling a surge of pride for his employee, the manager expressed his appreciation for the cashier's ability to handle challenging situations so well. This prompted the young cashier to share a few of his secrets - tips and tricks he had picked up in mastering the art of excellent customer service. The manager listened intently, the eagerness in his eyes revealing a genuine willingness to learn from and foster growth among his staff. As their conversation reached a natural lull, the cashier took the opportunity to inquire about an upcoming store renovation he had heard whispers about. The manager confessed that the rumors were, in fact, true. The store was set to undergo a complete transformation in the coming months - a project that would certainly require the dedication and cooperation of every employee. The young cashier’s eyes lit up with excitement as he began envisioning the possibilities this new undertaking would bring. Though the idea of change could be daunting for some, he saw it as a chance to positively impact the lives of colleagues and customers alike. The manager found this enthusiasm contagious and couldn't help but share more details about the project, noting that the cashier's attitude would ensure a smooth transition during the difficult renovation period. As their shift-change conversation approached its end, the cashier asked the manager how he could best contribute to the success of the store in its new venture. The manager thought for a moment before responding: \\"Continue to provide our customers with the exceptional service you've demonstrated today, foster a positive and collaborative environment for all of our staff, and never underestimate how invaluable your dedication is to the store's success.\\" With that, the young cashier nodded determinedly, feeling a newfound sense of purpose. Slipping off his apron, he thanked the manager for their conversation, whispered in the wind an inaudible \\"goodbye\\", and stepped out of the store with dreams of making the most of his newfound insights during the coming days of transformation. As the relieved cashier left, the manager took his place behind the register, ready to welcome the next wave of the day's clientele. And as the sun dipped below the horizon, the cycle of their daily responsibilities continued, each of them striving to put into practice what they had learned from each other that day."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - A steam locomotive is a railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible materialusually coal/coke, wood, or oilto produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind. The first steam locomotive, made by Richard Trevithick, first operated on 21 February 1804, three years after the road locomotive he made in 1801. The first practical steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop. - The Milwaukee Road 's class F7 comprised six ( # 100 -- # 105 ) high - speed , streamlined 4 - 6 - 4 \`\` Baltic '' or \`\` Hudson '' type steam locomotives built by Alco in 1937 -- 38 to haul the Milwaukee 's Hiawatha express passenger trains . Following on from the success of the road 's class A 4 - 4 - 2s , the F7s allowed the road to haul heavier trains on the popular Chicago -- Twin Cities routes . The F7s are major contenders for the fastest steam locomotives ever built , as they ran at over 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) daily . One run in January 1941 recorded by a reporter for Trains magazine saw 110 miles per hour ( 180 km / h ) achieved twice -- in the midst of a heavy snowstorm . Baron Gérard Vuillet , a French railroading expert , once recorded a run between Chicago and Milwaukee where the locomotive reached 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) and sustained an average 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) for 4.5 miles ( 7.2 km ) . However , the British locomotive LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard is officially accepted to be the world 's fastest , with a run recorded at 125.88 mph ( 202.58 km / h ) in 1938 . The Milwaukee F7s are accepted as the fastest steam locomotives by a different measure -- scheduled speed between stations . In 1939 , shortly after they were introduced into passenger service , the Twin Cities Hiawatha schedule was modified such that the engines would need to run the 78.3 mi ( 126.0 km ) between Portage and Sparta , Wisconsin in 58 minutes -- a start - to - stop average of 81 mph ( 130 km / h ) . First - built # 100 was also the first withdrawn from service , on November 10 , 1949 ; last - built # 105 was the final one in service , withdrawn August 10 , 1951 . All were scrapped . - On a steam locomotive, a driving wheel is a powered wheel which is driven by the locomotive's pistons (or turbine, in the case of a steam turbine locomotive). On a conventional, non-articulated locomotive, the driving wheels are all coupled together with side rods (also known as coupling rods); normally one pair is directly driven by the main rod (or connecting rod) which is connected to the end of the piston rod; power is transmitted to the others through the side rods. - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels, six powered and coupled driving wheels and four trailing wheels. In France, where the type was first used, it is known as the Baltic, while it became known as the Hudson in most of North America. What entity does 'milwaukee road class f7' has the relation 'powerplant' with? A:","output":"The entity that Milwaukee Road Class F7 has the relation 'powerplant' with is a steam engine, as these locomotives produced their pulling power through steam engines. These engines burned combustible materials, such as coal/coke, wood, or oil, to produce steam in a boiler, which powered the locomotive."},{"instruction":"How might one describe the sentiment of this review?

The men came from all over the Middle East and Africa: Yemen, Sudan, Tunisia, Afghanistan. They all wore the same blackened goggles, earmuffs and orange socks as U.S. soldiers guided them from the plane by their elbows. While some of the original 20 are still at Guantanamo today, the prison has changed a lot since then. These days when journalists arrive on the tarmac at Guantanamo, commanding officers ask how many are newcomers and promise \\"great programs\\" for the visitors. The \\"program\\" includes tours of several of the remaining detention camps, or watching military commission proceedings from behind soundproof glass. There is a certain permanence to Guantanamo that is unexpected, given that President Obama unequivocally promised to close the place. The president is not much closer to closing Guantanamo today than he was on the campaign trail when he made it one of his signature issues. His administration's best hope for shuttering the place rests with Brig. Gen. Mark Martins. He's the chief prosecutor of the military commissions, and he's like a U.S. attorney for Guantanamo. He helps decide who gets a military commissions trial and what the charges will be. 'A Full And Fair Trial' Over the past 10 years, the military commissions system at Guantanamo has been criticized as second-rate justice. Martins says this year he'll be able to convince the doubters otherwise. \\"The reformed military commissions aren't that different from Article 3 courts,\\" he says, referring to the federal criminal court system. \\"And if people watch what we do, they'll see that.\\" He says that will become clear as trials get under way this year. Observers will see stronger rules of evidence and more robust protections for attorney-client privilege. \\"I would not be part of this system if I didn't think that a full and fair trial will be held, and that justice will be served,\\" he says. Even if Martins is right, there is a complication: Not everyone held at Guantanamo will get a hearing, which means some people may be detained without a trial. Karen Greenberg, who runs the Center on National Security at Fordham University, says Guantanamo has codified indefinite detention by essentially having a category of detainee who will never have the opportunity to contest the government's allegations in court. \\"Unless they try everybody, they haven't tackled the hardest problem about Guantanamo and its legality,\\" she said. Possible Goodwill Gesture There are still 171 detainees at Guantanamo, and about 80 of them have been identified for release. Another three dozen will likely be tried in the military commissions, and then there is this other group — the group that seemed destined to be held indefinitely. There are 48 detainees who seem to fall into that category. The U.S. has said they don't have enough evidence to try them, but the men are too dangerous to release. Recently, one other way to deal with detainees has presented itself: transferring them as part of a broader negotiation strategy. And the first example of this would involve, among others, those Afghans who arrived on that first flight to Guantanamo 10 years ago Wednesday. U.S. officials are weighing whether to allow them to leave as part of a goodwill gesture to kick-start peace talks with the Taliban. Greenberg says doing so would be a big step forward for the Obama administration. \\"It's a philosophical game changer,\\" she said. \\"It's a wise course to at least consider it, and if it does happen, I think it can change a lot of things in its wake in terms of how we're going to progress in the region.\\" The three original detainees under discussion include the Taliban deputy minister of intelligence, Abdul Wasiq; a governor from northern Afghanistan, Norullah Noori; and the Taliban's deputy minister of defense, Mohammed Fazl. A source close to the prisoner transfer discussions said the men could be moved to a third country, possibly Qatar. The transfer would be part of a broader plan that would include setting up cease-fire zones in Afghanistan to test whether the Taliban are serious about peace. If it happens, it would mark the first time that detainees at Guantanamo would be transferred as part of an effort to wind down the war. ||||| Guantanamo Bay remains the persistent headache that pretty much all Americans would like to go away. Wednesday marks its 10th birthday as home to alleged terrorists scooped up by the U.S. following the 9/11 terror attacks. President Obama’s pledge to shut down the prison within a year of taking office passed two years ago. It has been a year since any of the remaining 171 detainees left, because of congressional bars on bringing them to the U.S., and the willingness of the U.S. government to sanction indefinite detention. “The commitment the president has to closing Guantanamo Bay,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday, “is as firm today as it was during the campaign.” Carney endorsed the headache notion, saying shutting Gitmo down …is the right thing to do for our national security interests. That has been an opinion shared not just by this president or members of this administration, but senior members of the military as well as this president’s predecessor [that would be President George W. Bush], and the man he ran against for this office in the general election [that would be GOP Senator John McCain of Arizona].” “There is plenty of blame to go around,” says Tom Parker of Amnesty International. “Congress has worked diligently to block the President’s attempts to close Guantánamo, but the President has also failed to make the case to the American people that it must be closed.” The decade will be marked by protests in Washington, Berlin, Madrid and London. Even some of the detainees are expected to reject their meals to protest their continuing confinement. Rights activists are not only upset with Obama for failing to keep his pledge to shut down the prison over congressional objections, but because he recently signed a defense bill authorizing indefinite military detention without trial. Thirty-six of the 171 still being held on the U.S. Navy base in southeastern Cuba await trial for war crimes; the remaining 135 are being held because they are allegedly dangerous, can’t be sent home because their homeland is falling apart, or because of congressional restrictions. Congress has barred delivering any of the detainees to the U.S. for trial, and blocked the transfer of many approved for release by a Justice Department-led task force. The Bush Administration flew the initial batch of 20 detainees to Gitmo in chains and orange jump suits that garnered worldwide attention a decade ago. By placing them on a U.S. military base in Cuba, their thinking went, they could be kept away from Americans – and from any legal rights they might get on U.S. soil. By the time Gitmo’s population crested at nearly 800 two years later, the place was roiling with anger. In the years since, more modern facilities have been built. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the supposed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, is scheduled to be arraigned at Gitmo later this year. Is the White House any closer to closing Gitmo today than it was on January 20, 2009, the day Obama became President? “This this is a process that faces obstacles that we’re all aware of,” Carney said Monday when he was asked, “and we will continue to work through it.” That’s White House-speak for don’t count on it. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Guantanamo Bay marks its 10th anniversary as home to alleged terrorists, with 171 detainees remaining.

Your task is to generate answer \\"yes\\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \\"no\\". Input: Review: Alan Curtis has a loud, violent sounding argument with his wife, slams out of his apartment, has a night of drinking with a mysterious lady with a large hat in a bar (run by Andrew Tombes, in a nice villainous part for a change), and returns to find his wife dead and the police, led by Thomas Gomez waiting for him. His attempts to prove his alibi - that he was with that mysterious lady - fall because everyone that he can think of (Tombes, Elisha Cook) claims there was never any such person. He ends up with no alibi, although his secretary (who secretly loves him) Ellen Raines believes him. Convicted after a trial, he is awaiting his death sentence. Raines starts going out after the truth, discovering that Gomez has some doubts of his own. She also finds an ally in a friend of Curtis, Franchot Tone, who was apparently out of town the night of the crime. Will she clear Curtis in time? THE PHANTOM LADY is based on a novel by William Irish (the great noir writer Cornell Woolrich). As movie fans know from other works by Woolrich (LEOPARD MAN, THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES, REAR WINDOW, NO MAN OF HER OWN) one cannot assume what is true on the surface anywhere. The missing wife of a salesman may not actually be upstate, sending him messages that she arrived, if he still has her jewelry. The mentalist may really be able to predict tragedy - or was he plotting the murder of his old partner, now an oil millionaire? Did a leopard kill the young women, or is the wealthy recluse in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge? Is the young woman, claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck, actually an impostor? Here it is Raines and Gomez (with an assist by Tone) trying to prove Curtis did see a woman nobody will admit seeing - and if he did see her, why is nobody else able to recall seeing her? The problem with the story really is Curtis's personality - he gives in too easily when found guilty of the crime he did not commit. In reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed. However, in defense of Curtis's collapse, it also happens to other people in various films: Gary Cooper, in MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, gets so disgusted about the framing he gets as delusional and mad by Douglas Dumbrille and his minions that he does not defend himself at first, until the people who would depend on his help cry out their fears in the courtroom and reawaken his sense of responsibility. But Curtis just seems to give up. In normal circumstances Raines, Gomez, and everyone else would not care if Curtis didn't.But the film survives this weakness. The slow unraveling of lies by witnesses bribed by the real killer allows two set pieces for Raines with Tombes on a deserted elevated platform and Elisha Cook at a jazz session. Gomez turns out to be more perceptive than the villain expects in double checking his alibi again. And the villain manages to keep slightly ahead of Raines and Gomez until the concluding minutes of the film. If it is not as great a film as DOUBLE INDEMNITY or THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE or THE MALTESE FALCON, it holds up pretty well until the moment Curtis and Raines are reunited at the end. Question: is it a negative review? Output:","output":"Part 1: Given a review of a movie Usage: Review: \\"Alan Curtis has a loud, violent sounding argument with his wife, slams...\\" This part is clearly met, as there is a lengthy review of the movie \\"The Phantom Lady\\" given.

On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured.

To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief.

One buyer offered to pay the full price if Chris would pay for the car maintenance inspection, which cost a tenth of Chris’s asking price. The other buyer agreed to pay the price if Chris replaced the headlights for 80 and the tires for three times as much. What is the difference between the amounts Chris will earn from the two offers? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Calculate the cost of the car maintenance inspection. Since the car maintenance inspection cost is a tenth of Chris's asking price, we can find the cost by dividing the asking price by 10: 5200 / 10 = 520 Step 2: Calculate the amount Chris will earn from the first offer. For the first offer, the buyer agrees to pay the full price, but Chris must cover the cost of the car maintenance inspection. To find the amount Chris will earn, we have to subtract the cost of the inspection from the asking price: 5200 - 520 = 4680 Step 3: Calculate the cost of replacing the headlights and tires for the second offer. The cost of replacing the headlights is given at 80. The cost of replacing the tires is three times the cost of the headlights: 80 * 3 = 240 Step 4: Calculate the total cost that Chris will incur for the second offer. To calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of replacing the headlights and the cost of replacing the tires: 80 + 240 = 320 Step 5: Calculate the amount Chris will earn from the second offer. For the second offer, the buyer agrees to pay the full price, but Chris must cover the cost of replacing the headlights and the tires. To find the amount Chris will earn, we have to subtract the total cost from the asking price: 5200 - 320 = 4880 Step 6: Calculate the difference between the amounts Chris will earn from the two offers. Now that we have the earnings from both offers, we can subtract the lesser amount (first offer) from the greater amount (second offer) to find the difference in earnings: 4880 - 4680 = 200 So, the difference between the amounts Chris will earn from the two offers is 200."},{"instruction":"Answer this question: who wrote if i were a carpenter and you were a lady??","output":"\\"If I Were a Carpenter\\" is a song written by a man named Tim Hardin.

Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park.

Article: Centuries ago, man discovered that removing moisture from food helps to store it, and that the easiest way to do this is to expose the food to sun and wind. In this way the North American Indians produce pemmican(dried meat ground into powder and made into cakes), the Scandinavians make stockfish and the Arabs dried dates. All foods include water--cabbage and other leaf vegetables contains as much as 93% water, potatoes and other root vegetables 80%, lean meat 75% and fish, anything from 80% to 60%, depending on how fatty it is. If this water is removed, the activity of the bacteria which cause food to go bad is checked. Fruit is sun-dried in Asia Minor, Greece, Spain and other Mediterranean countries, and also in California, South Africa and Australia. Various methods are used, but in general, the fruit is spread out on trays in drying yards in the hot sun. Nowadays most foods are dried mechanically. The method of such dehydration is to put food in chambers through which hot air is blown at temperatures of about 110degC at entry to about 43degC at exit. This is the usual method for drying such things as vegetables, minced meat, and fish. Dried foods take up less room and weigh less than the same food packed in cans or frozen, and they do not need to be stored in special conditions. For these reasons they are invaluable to the climbers, explorers and soldiers in battle, who have little storage space. They are also popular with housewives because it takes so little time to cook them. Usually it is just a case of replacing the dried-out moisture with boiling water.

To better understand the sentence's meaning, let's break down the elements of the sentence. The sentence can be understood as having two primary parts: 1. \\"Then he took a piece of iron the shape of the horse's foot\\" 2. \\"...and clapped it on, and drove some nails through the shoe quite into its hoof, so that the shoe was firmly on\\" In the first part of the sentence, \\"the horse's foot\\" refers to the foot of the horse itself. The piece of iron, which is \\"the shape of the horse's foot,\\" has been created in the form of a horseshoe to be fitted on the horse's hoof. The second part of the sentence demonstrates the actual process of attaching the horseshoe to the horse's hoof. In this context, \\"it\\" refers to the piece of iron (the horseshoe) mentioned in the first part of the sentence. The person (presumably a farrier) is essentially clapping the horseshoe onto the horse's hoof, and then driving nails through the horseshoe and into the horse's hoof to secure it in place. In summary, \\"horse\\" in this sentence refers to the animal, and \\"it\\" refers to the piece of iron (the horseshoe) shaped like the horse's foot. Although they pertain to different objects, both terms are ultimately connected through the process of attaching the horseshoe to the horse's hoof."},{"instruction":"No wonder this movie never saw the light of day.

The only other parchment copy is maintained by the National Archives in Washington, D.C., researchers Emily Sneff and Danielle Allen said in a statement. The newly discovered document — which the two have dated to the 1780s — was found in the town of Chichester archives, and is believed to have originally belonged to Duke of Richmond who was known as the “Radical Duke,’’ for the support he gave to Americans during the Revolutionary War, the researchers said.

Sign up for more newsletters here The signatories on the Sussex version of the document are not broken down by state, something that distinguished it from the Declaration in the National Archives, the researchers said. In an academic paper, the researchers say the document probably was commissioned by James Wilson of Pennsylvania, who later helped draft the Constitution and was among the original justices appointed to the Supreme Court. “The team hypothesizes that this detail supported efforts, made by Wilson and his allies during the Constitutional Convention and ratification process, to argue that the authority of the Declaration rested on a unitary national people, and not on a federation of states,’’ the researchers wrote in the statement. The team, working with British officials, is working to carefully test the document in a way that will not damage the parchment. Advertisement According to the National Archives, the Massachusetts Historical Commission holds one of 26 copies of the Declaration of Independence prepared by John Dunlap, the printer for the Congressional Congress, after its signing on July 4, 1776. John R. Ellement can be reached at ellement@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @JREbosglobe ||||| It started with a one-line entry from the catalog of a tiny records office in the town of Chichester, in the south of England: “Manuscript copy, on parchment, of the Declaration in Congress of the thirteen United States of America.” As part of an effort to assemble a database on every known edition of the Declaration of Independence, Emily Sneff, a researcher with the Declaration Resources Project, stumbled upon the listing in August 2015. Although she didn’t think much of it at the time, that short description would send Sneff and Harvard’s Danielle Allen on a two-year journey into American history. “I’d found vague descriptions of other copies of the Declaration that turned out to be 19th-century reproductions of the signed parchment in the National Archives, so that was what I was expecting,” Sneff said of her initial impression based on the catalog listing. “What struck me as significant was that it said manuscript on parchment.” Sneff contacted the archive, the West Sussex Record Office, whose staff mailed her a disc with photos of the document. “When I looked at it closely, I started to see details, like names that weren’t in the right order — John Hancock isn’t listed first, there’s a mark at the top that looks like an erasure, the text has very little punctuation in it — and it’s in a handwriting I hadn’t seen before,” she said. “As those details started adding up, I brought it to Danielle’s attention and we realized this was different from any other copy we had seen.” “We knew we had a mystery,” said Allen, the James Bryant Conant University Professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. “We had a big, big mystery. “There are three key questions we want to answer,” Allen continued. “One is: Can we date this parchment based on the material evidence? Second: Who commissioned it, and why? And third: How did it get to England?” Allen and Sneff are now providing some answers with a pair of papers. The first, currently in the final revision stage with the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, uses handwriting analysis, examination of the parchment preparation and styling, and spelling errors in the names of the signers to date the Sussex Declaration to the 1780s. The second paper, presented at a Yale University conference on Friday, argues that the document was probably commissioned by James Wilson of Pennsylvania, who later helped draft the Constitution and was among the original justices of the Supreme Court. But the document isn’t simply a previously unknown piece of history — it provides a unique window into the political upheavals of early America. In the immediate aftermath of the July 4, 1776, signing, Allen noted, there was a period of “breaking news” in which the Declaration was reproduced and printed in a variety of formats as the news spread through the colonies and eventually made its way across the Atlantic to England. “The versions that people would have seen in July and August 1776 were broadsides and newspapers, starting with John Dunlap’s broadside, which was printed on the night of July 4,” Sneff said. “Those copies would have made their way across to England as well — there are Dunlap broadsides in their National Archives.” But it wasn’t until approximately a decade later that the Sussex Declaration was produced, amid a tumultuous period for the new nation. “Victory was not sweet,” Allen said. “There was financial disaster, the Articles of Confederation were not working … so the 1780s were a period of great instability, despite victory. And this parchment belongs to that decade.” Among the chief political debates of the era, Allen said, was whether the new nation had been founded on the basis of the people’s authority or the authority of the states. By reordering the names of the signers, perhaps the most conspicuous feature of the parchment, the Sussex Declaration comes down squarely on one side of the argument. On most documents of the era, Allen said, the protocol was for members of each state delegation to sign together, with signatures typically running either down the page or from left to right, with the names of the states labeling each group. An exception was made for a small number of particularly important documents — including the Declaration, which was signed from right to left, and which omitted the names of the states, though the names were still grouped by state. “But the Sussex Declaration scrambles the names so they are no longer grouped by state,” Allen said. “It is the only version of the Declaration that does that, with the exception of an engraving from 1836 that derives from it. This is really a symbolic way of saying we are all one people, or ‘one community,’ to quote James Wilson.” Allen and Sneff will continue to probe how the parchment reached England. Also, they are working on a project in collaboration with the West Sussex Record Office, the British Library, and the Library of Congress to perform hyper-spectral imaging on the parchment and other non-invasive studies in the hope of reading some text that appears to have been scraped away at the top of the document. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Two researchers from Harvard University have found a second parchment manuscript copy of the Declaration of Independence in a little records office in southern England.

Marcus Townend, Racing Correspondent. PUBLISHED:. 11:03 EST, 13 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 14:08 EST, 14 November 2012. Shock: Frankie Dettori, pictured with his wife. Catherine, faces a world ban after a failed drugs test. French authorities were 'tipped off' that Frankie Dettori – Britain's best-known jockey – had taken a banned substance, it emerged today. The 41-year-old three-time champion jockey was shocked when officials demanded a drugs test and has been left devastated by the failure that is threatening to derail his career. He faces a hearing before the medical committee of the French racing authorities next week after testing positive for cocaine or a derivative of it while riding Longchamp on September 16. A well-placed racing source in Paris told the Evening Standard today that Dettori 'was taken by surprise by the test, following a tip-off from a third party'. Dettori is currently in Dubai, where he has stopped off after riding in the Melbourne Cup on November 6. Sources have told the Daily Mail the Italian has been ‘knocked for six’ by the positive test, which was ‘a moment of madness rather than a genuine addiction.’ Dettori’s withdrawal from his mounts at Doncaster on Saturday was unrelated to the imminent disciplinary hearing. However, Coral has removed Dettori from its 2013 champion jockey betting with the threat of a long ban hanging over him. Fellow jockey Kieran Fallon was handed a six-month ban by the France Galop in 2006 when he tested positive to cocaine for the first time. A ban of such magnitude, which would not start until Dettori’s disciplinary process was completed, would potentially rule out Dettori until May or June of next year. Coral spokesman David Stevens said: ‘If, as reports suggest, Frankie Dettori has failed a test involving cocaine, a six-month suspension is likely, and such a ban would rule him out of a title bid next year.’ The revelation has caused a sensation. in the racing world. Dettori, famous for his exuberance and flying. dismount, was awarded an MBE in 2000 and has become a major TV. celebrity. He was a one-time captain on the BBC's A Question of Sport and co-owner of a restaurant with chef Marco Pierre White. In the dock: The 41-year-old tested positive for a. prohibited substance following a meeting at Longchamp racecourse in. Paris in September, where he took part in four races. A. three-time champion jockey, he has won more than 500 group races in his. career. But his exploits in the saddle achieved legendary status at. Ascot in 1996, when he won all seven races in a row. In an interview, Detorri said: 'I. won the last race on Fujiyama Crest. I bought him when he retired and. now he lives peacefully in my field. 'My wife Catherine made me a bronze. cast of his foot – it reminds me of the wonderful horse that made me. famous.' Under reciprocal arrangements in place. between international racing authorities, any ban imposed in one. country would apply internationally. Dettori's solicitor,. Christopher Stewart-Moore, said in a statement: 'I can confirm that, as a consequence. of a positive test at Longchamp on September 16, he will be the subject. of an inquiry by the Medical Committee of France Galop next week. Frankie's folly: Frankie Dettori rides ex-racehorse Monsignor, left, to carry the Olympic Flame around the parade ring at Ascot Racecourse. Right, his famous dismount after riding all seven winners in one meeting. Dettori wins the Prince of Wales's Stakes, his 45th Royal Ascot victory, on Rewilding in June 2011. Rides: 3,422. Wins: 943. Strike rate: 28 per cent. Group One victories: 110 (262 victories at Listed level or higher) Dubai World Cup wins: Three - Dubai Millennium (2000), Moon Ballad (2003) & Electrocutionist (206) He won 14 British Classics (nine riding for Godolphing) On September 28, 1996, he partnered all seven winners on the card at Ascot. 'In compliance with, and out of. respect for, the regulations of France Galop he will not be commenting. further until the France Galop procedures have been completed.' Dettori and his wife, with whom he has five children, were not at their home near Newmarket, Suffolk, last night. A relative who answered the door said:. 'I don't know anything about it. Frankie is in Los Angeles and. Catherine is in Hertfordshire with one of the children.' The jockey parted company with racing stable Godolphin last month after an 18-year relationship. Dettori was expected to continue. working his contract until the end of this year but Godolphin said at. the time that 'the retainer was not really working'. In 1993, Dettori. received a caution for possession of cocaine after he had been to watch. Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday play at Wembley in the FA Cup final. Speaking about it in 2010, he said: 'That wasn't about losing weight. That was for fun.' Describing how a 'fast' lifestyle took. over from his focus on horse racing when he began earning big money, he. added: 'Everyone wanted to be with me. I'd go clubbing, there was. cocaine and there I was like the big show-off, the idiot.' Sporting minds: In 2002 Frankie became a team captain on A Question of Sport. Family man: Frankie with wife Catherine son Leo and daughter Ella at the premiere of The Chronicles Of Narnia in December 2005. The jockey also had a professional DJ. booth built in his home. He said: 'It started off as a bit of a joke,. but now I can't imagine life without it. 'When we have people round and the. champagne's flowing I start playing music, but I usually get kicked off. pretty fast because everybody wants a go.' The race day at Longchamp in September. is used to trial horses for the highlight of the racecourse's calendar,. the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, which is held in October. He finished second in one race, third in two others and was unplaced in the fourth. Jockey Kieren Fallon was banned for. six months by France Galop in 2006 after a positive test. It banned him. for another 18 months after a second positive test in August 2007. Frankie Dettori receives his prize from The Queen after winning the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes on Daylami at Ascot in July, 1999. Highlights:","output":"1. Frankie Dettori, a famous jockey, failed a drug test and might get banned from racing. 2. He was tested for drugs in France and the results showed he had taken something not allowed. 3. Frankie was very surprised and sad about this news. 4. He will have a meeting with French racing people next week to see what happens. 5. If he gets banned, he might not be able to race for a long time."},{"instruction":"Low-income domestic violence victims may find long-term legal help -- representation in divorces or child-custody disputes -- hard to come by, if two organizations now providing such help can't replace their lost funding. The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake and Utah Legal Services are already facing cutbacks after they were refused a federal grant of more than 450,000 in September. The board overseeing the state Office of Crime Victim Reparations [CVR] has voted to deny a stopgap funding request from the two organizations. While describing the request as a worthy cause, board members agreed Tuesday that funding divorces or custody disputes was outside their focus -- providing direct services for crime victims. The 175,000 requested would have allowed the legal aid groups to maintain a skeleton staff to continue providing help beyond emergency protective orders for victims, completing existing cases and offering services in limited cases. The groups also plan to enlist more pro bono attorneys through coordination with the Utah State Bar. \\"We don't have a lot more options,\\" said Anne Milne, executive director of Utah Legal Services, after learning of the CVR refusal Wednesday. The organization has already lost some staff through attrition and has turned away some cases, she said. Milne said she may ask the board overseeing her organization to give her until November to seek funding from additional sources. Without additional funding, the outlook for longer-term legal help is unclear. For two years, the groups had received 18-month civil legal assistance grants from the U.S. Department of Justice and had used them to provide such assistance. But last month, a third request was denied. Funding used to help victims obtain emergency protective orders remains in place, said Milne and Stewart Ralphs, executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake. Although an order's requirements that an abuser stay away from a victim may remain in effect for years, protective orders only settle issues such as child custody, child support, custody and property arrangements for 150 days. Many judges are reluctant to address those issues in emergency protective orders, since the decrees stay in effect for such a short time, Milne and Ralphs said. \\"The likelihood a victim will return to her abuser increases if she cannot permanently sever the relationship and establish workable support, custody and property arrangements,\\" the funding request to CVR said. The Department of Justice said it denied the grant application, in part, because evaluators did not see enough collaboration between the organizations and victims' advocates, Ralphs and Milne told CVR board members. While the two said they believe their organizations coordinate well, the organizations cannot appeal the grant denial. Although CVR board members considered giving the money as a loan, not a grant, their vote on the funding request -- taken after Milne and Ralphs left the meeting -- was unanimous. After reading the above, is \\"Emergency protective orders are short term and it lasts for a 150 days\\" the correct answer to the question \\"When a judge issues an emergency protective order is it long or short term and how many days does it cover?\\"? Choose from: [+] no.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: To begin answering this question, it's important to know that human blood types are determined by the presence or absence of specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells. There are four main blood groups: A, B, AB, and O, which are further divided into positive and negative Rh factors. The A blood type has A antigens on the surface of the red blood cells, and people with this blood type produce anti-B antibodies. This is significant because the anti-B antibodies would cause an immune response if the person with A blood type received B or AB blood during a transfusion. Now, let's consider the global population and which blood type is the most commonly found. This is a crucial aspect to address, as blood types are not evenly distributed among the world. Genetics and ancestry play a significant role in determining the distribution of blood types across different regions and populations. There is a great variety of blood types in different ethnic groups, but when viewing the global population as a whole, research and blood center statistics have shown that (A) the O blood type is the most common. The O blood group lacks both A and B antigens on the surface of red blood cells, making it compatible with any other blood group in an emergency situation. In conclusion, the most common blood type in the human population is Type O. This fact is derived from an analysis of the prevalence of different blood types across various ethnic groups and the overall distribution of blood types among the global population."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Sediment becomes loose from the rest of the soil - The sediment rolls down hill towards a river - The heavy items sink to the bottom - The lighter items float on the top and in convection cycles - As the river flows the sediment is moved - The sediment gets dumped through tributaries into lakes and the ocean - The sediment keeps moving around the world in convection currents. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the entire planet has heated up happens, how will it affect LESS sediment being transported. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process. With the planet heating up, glaciers and ice caps are more likely to melt. This could result in more water entering rivers, potentially leading to an increase in the amount of sediment being eroded and transported. However, increased evaporation due to the heat could potentially decrease the amount of water in some rivers and lakes, which could decrease the amount of sediment being transported.

It's a general query that prompts an examination of individuals who exemplify these traits. This would require evaluating various personalities, whether famous, historical, or personal, who are known for their dedication and perseverance. Determining an answer to this question is subjective and depends on individual perspectives, as diverse figures from history, entertainment, sports, politics, and other fields might stand out to different people. 2. \\"Who is the most admiring person in your life?\\" This question is more personalized, asking for an individual's personal view on who they admire the most in their life. It's not limited to hard work alone but may also include other qualities and characteristics that one finds commendable. It could be a parent, family member, friend, teacher, or even a public figure. The answer to this question is highly subjective and unique to each person's experiences and relationships. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same, as the first question aims to identify the most admirable hardworking person in general, whereas the second question seeks to know who an individual personally admires the most in their life.

Although the two countries have no historical or political relations that would have influenced their flag designs, their flags share a striking resemblance. The flag of Monaco consists of two equal horizontal bands of red (top) and white (bottom). It was officially adopted on April 4, 1881, under the reign of Prince Charles III. The red and white colors have been associated with the ruling House of Grimaldi since the 14th century. These colors were originally derived from the family's coat of arms, which shows a shield with alternating red and white diamonds. The flag's simple design reflects Monaco's status as a constitutional monarchy. On the other hand, the flag of Indonesia consists of two equal horizontal bands of red (top) and white (bottom) as well. It is known as the \\"Sang Saka Merah-Putih\\" in the Indonesian language, which translates to \\"The Sacred Red-and-White.\\" The flag was officially adopted on August 17, 1945, when Indonesia declared its independence from Dutch colonial rule. The red stripe symbolizes courage and bravery, while the white stripe represents purity and spirituality. Its design was inspired by the Majapahit Empire's flag, which was one of the most powerful empires in Southeast Asia during the 13th to 14th centuries. At first glance, the flags of Monaco and Indonesia seem identical, but there are subtle size differences. The flag of Monaco has a proportion of 4:5, while the Indonesian flag has a proportion of 2:3. Moreover, the shade of the red color in both flags may slightly differ. Despite their staggering similarities, the flags of these two nations have different origins and symbolism. The resemblance between the two flags is one of those curious coincidences in vexillology, which is the study of flags and their history."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: More than 15 million Britons, many of them women, will holiday unaccompanied this year. And they will no longer be treated as second-class citizens. After 50 years of being slighted, ripped off, herded together and allocated the worst rooms in the hotel, the single traveller's time has finally come. Rather than being viewed as an awkward peculiarity in the standard couples-and-families \\"system\\", single travelers have become travel's fastest growing sector and a phenomenon that tour operators are falling over themselves to catch up with. In one sense, the boom is the result of people postponing marriage and children. Approximately 39% of the adult British population--19 million people--is now single and the proportion of one-person households has increased from 18% in 1971 to 29% last year. The most significant growth of singles over the next few years is expected to be within the well-off, travel-hungry 25-34 age group. The expansion in single travel is being increased by women. Women are just as happy as men to leave partner at home and head off on holiday. On adventure group trips single women constitute more than half of all travelers, and Internet agents report that 70% of their single clients are women. Women today see being single as an opportunity to travel, rather than as an obstacle. The result is that travel companies are now attempting to work out new ways of attracting singles----a market worth PS10.4 billion. The number of specialist singles tour operators has risen from a couple to at least 10, but they face a growing challenge from mainstream operators, who now propose to target solo travelers with moves like abolishing single room supplements. At the moment, single travelers usually have to join a group, or pay more. As soon as we get beyond that, the singles market is going to take off to a completely new level. Travel companies are reacting to changing trends by _ . A) trying to find travel partners for singles B) charging more for one-person room occupancy C) encouraging solo travelers to join groups D) specializing in singles holiday requirements A:","output":"D) Specializing in singles holiday requirements The boom in single travelers, driven by factors such as shifting lifestyles, postponing marriage and children, and an increase in solo female travelers, has led to the rise of a lucrative market worth £10.4 billion. Recognizing the potential in catering to the needs and preferences of single travelers, travel companies are now rethinking their strategies and exploring new ways to attract this growing demographic. Historically, single travelers have often been treated as second-class citizens — given less desirable accommodations and charged extra for occupying a room by themselves. However, with the rapidly expanding market for solo travel, the industry has begun to acknowledge the importance of accommodating single travelers better and the opportunities to be gained by doing so. One approach to tap into this market is by specializing in singles holiday requirements, which can involve customizing packages and experiences specifically for solo travelers. This can include offering a wider range of activities or events tailored to individual interests, ensuring safety and comfort for solo travelers, and providing opportunities for singles to socialize and meet like-minded individuals. As a response to the growing number of single travelers, specialist singles tour operators have increased from just a few to at least ten. These operators solely focus on offering trips and experiences specifically designed for single travelers, differentiating themselves from mainstream tour operators, who typically cater to couples and families. Moreover, mainstream operators are also recognizing the potential to capture a share of the single travel market and are adapting their strategies. One such move is the proposal to abolish single room supplements, which have long remained an obstacle for single travelers in terms of cost and accessibility. In conclusion, the answer is D) specializing in singles holiday requirements, as travel companies are actively responding to the changing trends in the market by tailoring their services to better accommodate single travelers and capture a significant share of the growing and lucrative solo travel sector."},{"instruction":"Phone calls to Spitzer 's office , Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were not immediately returned . A message left with Spitzer 's office as well as Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were not immediately returned . Please tell me if the sentences above mean the same.","output":"Step 1: Read and analyze both sentences. Sentence 1: Phone calls to Spitzer 's office , Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were not immediately returned. Sentence 2: A message left with Spitzer 's office as well as Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were not immediately returned. Step 2: Break down the sentences into their main components. Sentence 1: Phone calls were made to three entities (Spitzer's office, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs), and they were not immediately returned. Sentence 2: A message was left with three entities (Spitzer's office, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs), and it was not immediately returned. Step 3: Compare the meanings of both sentences. In Sentence 1, the focus is on \\"phone calls\\" that were made to the three entities, and these calls were not immediately returned. In Sentence 2, the focus is on \\"a message\\" left with the three entities, and this message was not immediately returned. Step 4: Determine if both sentences mean the same. While both sentences convey a similar meaning, there are some differences. Sentence 1 mentions \\"phone calls,\\" which means multiple calls were possibly made to each entity. Sentence 2 mentions \\"a message,\\" indicating that only one message was left with the three entities. In both cases, the messages or calls were not immediately returned. However, the number of messages/calls involved differs between the two sentences. Final Assessment: The sentences have a similar meaning but are not exactly the same. The primary difference lies in the number of messages or calls that were left with the three entities (multiple phone calls in Sentence 1 vs. a single message in Sentence 2)."},{"instruction":"New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success. Question: \\"What did Howard Hughes purchase during his Vegas buying spree?\\" Response: \\"Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains\\" Options: + no + yes Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes The response correctly answers the question as it provides a detailed list of what Howard Hughes purchased during his Vegas buying spree, which includes six casinos, an airport, an airline, and numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Which country did NOT get invaded?\\" is in \\"In 2008 the Government of Canada made efforts, through the Canada First Defence Strategy, to modernize the Canadian Armed Forces, through the purchase of new equipment, improved training and readiness, as well as the establishment of the Canadian Special Operations Regiment.

But that was in an era when courts used it mostly to protect powerless people like civil rights activists and war protesters. These days, a provocative new study says, there has been a “corporate takeover of the First Amendment.” The assertion is backed by data, and it comes from an unlikely source: John C. Coates IV, who teaches business law at Harvard and used to be a partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, the prominent corporate law firm. “Corporations have begun to displace individuals as the direct beneficiaries of the First Amendment,” Professor Coates wrote. The trend, he added, is “recent but accelerating.” Professor Coates’s study was only partly concerned with the Supreme Court’s recent decisions amplifying the role of money in politics. “It’s not just Citizens United,” he said in an interview, referring to the 2010 decision that allowed unlimited independent spending by corporations in elections. His study, he said, analyzed First Amendment challenges from businesses to an array of economic regulations. Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia, described the shift in First Amendment doctrine in 2013 in The New Republic. “Once the patron saint of protesters and the disenfranchised, the First Amendment has become the darling of economic libertarians and corporate lawyers who have recognized its power to immunize private enterprise from legal restraint,” Professor Wu wrote. “Madison’s Music,” a new book by Burt Neuborne, a law professor at New York University, gives a detailed history of the transformation of First Amendment law. In his account, “the American right discovered the First Amendment” in the early 1970s. “An expansive conception of free speech became attractive to Republican justices,” he wrote, “both because robust free-speech protection fit neatly into the right’s skeptical, deregulatory approach to government generally, and because it encouraged vigorous transmission by powerful speakers of the right’s newly energized collection of ideas.” Those conservative justices, Professor Neuborne wrote, found willing allies in liberal justices long committed to free speech. In the next two decades, the Supreme Court continued to protect dissent, twice voting to strike down laws banning flag burning. But now, Professor Neuborne wrote, broad coalitions of justices also voted to protect the powerful. In 1976 alone, he wrote, the court shielded both unrestricted election spending by rich people, “giving the 1 percent a tangible reason to celebrate a muscular First Amendment,” and commercial advertising, “giving corporate management a strong stake in the First Amendment.” By the time the left woke up and realized it had made “a Faustian bargain,” Professor Neuborne wrote, “the bipartisan coalition had generated an enormously powerful body of precedent establishing an imperial free speech clause.” The case on commercial speech, Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, was a turning point, Professor Coates found in his study. After that ruling, the average number of First Amendment cases in the Supreme Court involving businesses started to rise to 2.2 a year from 1.5, and the number involving individuals started to fall, to 3.6 from 4.3. More striking, the success rates for both groups increased, but far more for businesses. Individuals won 55 percent of the time, up from 41 percent. Businesses also won 55 percent of the time, up from 20 percent. Before 1976, First Amendment challenges from corporations generally involved companies in the business of free expression, like newspapers, book publishers and film producers. More recently, companies have filed free-speech challenges to laws regulating how ordinary products may be marketed or advertised. Professor Coates also analyzed data from federal appeals courts, finding that “businesses are growing steadily more aggressive in their use of the First Amendment.” Court dockets these days are full of free-speech challenges from pharmaceutical firms, tobacco companies, miners, meat producers and airlines. Such lawsuits, he wrote, have pernicious consequences for both free enterprise and the rule of law. Corporations are diverting resources from research and innovation to litigation, he wrote. “Concentrated, moneyed interests, represented by those in control of the country’s largest business corporations,” he wrote, “are increasingly able to turn law into a lottery, reducing law’s predictability, impairing property rights, and increasing the share of the economy devoted to rent-seeking rather than productive activity.” The court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has been receptive to arguments based on corporations’ free-speech rights. In a recent essay, Laurence H. Tribe, a law professor at Harvard, offered a cautious partial defense of the Citizens United decision. But he said it was an instance of a larger phenomenon. “It is part of a trend in First Amendment law that is transforming that body of doctrine into a charter of largely untrammeled libertarianism,” he wrote, “in which the regulation of virtually all forms of speech and all kinds of speakers is treated with the same heavy dose of judicial skepticism, with exceptions perversely calculated to expose particularly vulnerable and valuable sorts of expression to unconvincingly justified suppression.” Professor Tribe gave examples of the sorts of people whose First Amendment arguments have not fared well in the Roberts court: students, prisoners, pacifists and whistle-blowers. Floyd Abrams, a leading First Amendment lawyer who has defended The New York Times and was on the winning side in Citizens United, reflected on the trend toward protecting the powerful in a speech last week at Temple University. “There is truth in the proposition that a number of recent First Amendment victories in recent years have been on behalf of the ‘haves’ — some of them corporations, some individuals,” he said. “But that is no basis for concluding that the decisions were wrongly analyzed or wrongly decided.” A version of this article appears in print on March 24, 2015, on page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Corporations Take First Amendment and Apply It Liberally.

Mike Malinin was the band's drummer from January 1995 until December 27, 2013 (but not made an official member until 1998). Although renowned for their commercially successful 1998 single \\"Iris\\", they have had several other notable and popular singles including \\"Name\\" and \\"Naked\\" from 1995's A Boy Named Goo, \\"Slide\\", \\"Black Balloon\\", \\"Dizzy\\", and \\"Broadway\\" from 1998's Dizzy Up the Girl, \\"Here Is Gone\\" from 2002's Gutterflower, \\"Better Days\\", \\"Give a Little Bit\\", and \\"Stay with You\\" from 2006's Context: The band's original lineup included John Rzeznik (vocals, guitar), Robby Takac (vocals, bass), and George Tutuska (drums, percussion). Takac and Tutuska had been long-time friends in school and met Rzeznik while he was playing in the band The Beaumonts with Takac's cousin, Paul Takac and close friend Michael Harvey who was the inspiration for the band. The trio picked their name from a True Detective ad for a toy called a Goo Goo Doll. \\"We were young and we were a garage band not trying to get a deal. We had a gig that night and needed a name. It's the best we came up with, and for some reason it stuck. If I had five more minutes, I definitely would have picked a better name\\", John stated. With Takac as their lead singer, the band released their first album, Goo Goo Dolls in 1987 on Mercenary Records, but was picked up in 1988 by Celluloid Records, a larger record company. They played around Buffalo's underground music circuit opening for punk bands such as SNFU, Dag Nasty, ALL, The Dead Milkmen, Gang Green, Doughboys, and DRI and playing with fellow Buffalo bands. The band released its second album Jed in 1989. The band released its third album, Hold Me Up, in 1990 and featured Rzeznik as the lead vocalist on five tracks, including the single, \\"There You Are\\"--as well as their then concert favorite, \\"Two Days in February\\". After being embraced by local college radio and punk scenes (including playing such venues as CBGB), the Goo Goo Dolls' third release incorporated elements of heavy metal, pop rock, and punk rock. In 1991, the song \\"I'm Awake Now\\" was recorded for the soundtrack of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. Superstar Car Wash, released in 1993, received significant media attention. The critical success and encouraging sales of their last album resulted in a larger budget from Metal Blade Records. The album was partially recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario. \\"We Are the Normal\\" (the single for which Rzeznik asked frontman Paul Westerberg of The Replacements to write the lyrics) received a major push toward play on college and independent radio, while its video was displayed on MTV's 120 Minutes program. \\"Fallin' Down\\" made it onto the 1993 soundtrack of Pauly Shore's hit film Son in Law. Question: is there any other intersting facts about the article that is significant?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there are more interesting facts about the Goo Goo Dolls. Here's one for you: The Goo Goo Dolls became very famous because of their song \\"Iris\\" which was released in 1998.

Pernetti's resignation comes three days after video came to light showing Rice shoving, grabbing and throwing balls at players and using gay slurs during practice. \\"My continued tenure as Athletic Director is no longer sustainable for the University which I attended and where a piece of me will always remain,\\" Pernetti said in his resignation letter. \\"In connection with the incidents involving former basketball Coach Mike Rice, as was the case with all other matters which I handled on behalf of the University, I always tried my best to do what is right.\\" In the letter, Pernetti went on to say that his position was to fire Rice -- although earlier this week he had said he was intent on rehabilitating the coach's behavior, in part through counseling -- but that he apparently didn't have the support of his superiors. Pernetti, with the approval of Rutgers president Robert L. Barchi, initially suspended Rice three games in December and fined him 50,000 when Rice's mistreatment of players was brought to the AD's attention. \\"I have spent a great deal of time reflecting on the events which led to today,\\" Pernetti said. \\"As you know, my first instincts when I saw the videotape of Coach Rice's behavior was to fire him immediately. However, Rutgers decided to follow a process involving university lawyers, human resources professionals, and outside counsel. Following review of the independent investigative report, the consensus was that university policy would not justify dismissal. I have admitted my role in, and regret for, that decision, and wish that I had the opportunity to go back and override it for the sake of everyone involved.\\" But a Jan. 21 report by outside counsel hired by Rutgers -- John Lacey of Connell Foley LLP -- states that Rice could have been fired then: \\" ... due to the intensity with which Coach Rice engaged in some of the misconduct, we believe AD Pernetti could reasonably determine that Coach Rice's action tended to embarrass and bring shame or disgrace to Rutgers in violation of Coach Rice's employment contract with Rutgers.\\" Pernetti will be paid more than 1.25 million for resigning as part of a settlement, The Star-Ledger of Newark reported Friday. Pernetti also is still eligible to receive any bonus based on the success of Rutgers teams' athletic, financial or academic goals. He also gets to keep his laptop, iPad and car stipend until 2014, and his medical benefits and pension until 2015. Rice's contract will pay him more than 1 million. Barchi, like Pernetti, has come under heavy criticism for Rice's remaining on the job as coach for as long as he did. He announced at a campus news conference that John B. Wolf, Rutgers' interim senior vice president and general counsel, also has resigned his position. Barchi is \\"highly likely\\" to remain with the university, a source told ESPN's Brett McMurphy. \\"At the end of the day, he has to run this place, day in and day out,\\" said Ralph Izzo, chairman of the school's board of governors. \\"And I think he is the right person to run this place for many years to come. \\"Dr. Barchi was brought on here eight months ago with two primary objectives: No. 1 was to build a strategic plan for this university for 10 years, going forward, to lead us to academic success and academic greatness; and No. 2, an enormous challenge of integrating a medical school with this university. Being on the job two months, hearing from a general counsel and the athletic director that there was a serious problem, I think he did the right thing by acquiescing to that advice at the time.\\" Barchi reiterated Friday that he had not seen the videotape until this week. Had he seen it in November, he said, he would have recommended that Rice be fired. He said Pernetti gave him a summary of what was on the Rice video at the time. When pressed, he said that in retrospect, he should have asked to view the tapes. Sources told ESPN that at least three Rutgers board members did witness the video of Rice last year and agreed with the suspension and fine as punishment. \\"This was a failure of process. I regret that I did not ask to see this video when Tim first told me of its existence,\\" Barchi said. \\"I want to apologize to the entire Rutgers community for the negative impact that this situation has had on Rutgers. \\"I also apologize to the LGBT community and all of us who share their values for the homophobic slurs shown on that video. I personally know how hurtful that language can be.\\" Based on the summary he received from Pernetti, Barchi said he \\"agreed with and supported his recommendation to suspend, rather than fire, Coach Rice at that time. It was not until Tuesday evening of this week, when I watched the video, that I had the opportunity to witness personally for the first time what Tim had seen last fall. \\"I was deeply disturbed by the behavior that the video revealed, which was much more abusive and pervasive than I had understood it to be. As Tim acknowledged on Wednesday, his decision to rehabilitate, rather than fire, Coach Rice was wrong.\\" Wolf is believed to have recommended against firing Rice in December. Barchi said Friday that he would appoint an interim athletic director in the coming days. Pernetti's departure follows his firing of Rice on Wednesday and the resignation of assistant coach Jimmy Martelli, who also was seen on tape treating players in a like manner. The video was obtained by \\"Outside the Lines\\" and aired on ESPN on Tuesday. More than 50 Rutgers faculty members had signed a letter calling for the dismissal of Pernetti for his handling of the Rice situation. Eric Murdock, the former director of player development for the Scarlet Knights, told \\"Outside the Lines\\" that he spoke with Pernetti in June and November about Rice's mistreatment of players. Murdock, whose contract wasn't renewed by the coach and AD last July, also told ESPN that he was not contacted beyond his November discussion with Pernetti and other university officials. Murdock told \\"Outside the Lines\\" that Rice's \\"outrageous\\" behavior had caused at least three players to transfer from the team. Murdock, as promised, filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the university Friday in Essex County, N.J. ESPN reported Thursday that Murdock's attorney, Raj Gadhok, sought 950,000 from the university in December as a settlement. Gov. Chris Christie issued a statement Friday calling Pernetti's resignation \\"appropriate and necessary given the events of the past six months.\\" \\"I commend President Barchi for his decisive leadership in coming to an agreement with Mr. Pernetti to have the Athletic Department of Rutgers University come under new leadership,\\" he said. \\"This entire incident was regrettable and while it has damaged the reputation of our state University, we need to move forward now on a number of fronts which provide great opportunities for Rutgers' future.\\" The state university of New Jersey also is in danger of losing some of its biggest donors in tough economic times. Friday ended with some of Rutgers' biggest backers threatening to stop writing checks because they were upset Pernetti was forced out for not firing Rice when he first became aware of the video. Tom Mendiburu, whose High Point Solutions paid 6 million for the naming rights to the university's football stadium, tweeted that he was concerned, saying he made the deal because of Pernetti. \\"We've invested so much into #RU and now I'm not even sure who we turn to. Very sad day and I'm sorry Pernetti had to go through this,\\" he tweeted. Mendiburu said a lot of people are asking him what he is going to do -- and he isn't sure. The Star-Ledger of Newark reported that Daniel Wheeler, a founding member of the Society of Queens College, was upset that Rutgers ignored prominent donors' pleas to keep Pernetti. Membership in the society, which bears the name under which Rutgers was chartered in 1766, requires a minimum of 1 million donated to the school. \\"I won't say numbers, but I've given over seven figures, and like a lot of people who have done the same, I support Tim Pernetti,\\" Wheeler told the newspaper. Last month, Sports Business Journal named Pernetti one of its five finalists for athletic director of the year. It appeared he would survive this incident based on his past accomplishments at the school. A 1993 Rutgers graduate who was hired as Rutgers' AD in April 2009, Pernetti was instrumental in Rutgers moving from the Big East to the Big Ten Conference for 2014. Because of the move, Rutgers will increase its media rights revenue from about 3 million annually in the Big East to more than 40 million annually by 2017, sources said. \\"It's really sad. Obviously, that conduct is way, way out of bounds, \\" Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany told ESPN.com's Adam Rittenberg. \\"It was unacceptable. It's sad that Tim was separated from Rutgers. I don't really know all the details. ... Obviously, there's accountability there. Institutions hire coaches and they terminate them, and really it's not an area we're involved with.\\" Delany said the Big Ten learned about Rice's situation only after the video aired, and didn't know the reason behind Rice's initial fine and suspension. \\"I just assumed 50,000 and a three-game suspension must have been serious, but beyond that, I don't have any detail,\\" Delany said. The firings will not affect Rutgers' transition to the Big Ten, the conference announced Friday. \\"There's no impact on their transition to membership,\\" Delany told ESPN.com. \\"These issues are sort of personnel issues. These are strictly local issues, and institutions are expected to handle them, and Rutgers is handling them. Maybe not in the way they should have initially. They would acknowledge that they probably came up short, but as long as people cure the problems that they have when they come up with them, I don't know that you can do much more.\\" Stephen Sweeney, the president of the state Senate, called for Pernetti to step down or be fired. Sweeney said Pernetti deserved credit for getting Rutgers into the Big Ten but he mishandled what Rice had done within the program. Pernetti hired Rice away from Robert Morris, which he led to two NCAA tournament appearances, in the spring of 2010. \\"This incident will continue to hang over Rutgers like a dark cloud for weeks, months and perhaps years to come,\\" the Democratic lawmaker said in a statement Thursday. \\"It seems pretty clear that things were not handled well from the start.\\" However, some prominent former Rutgers football players wanted Pernetti to remain. NFL All-Pro running back Ray Rice said that when he returned to campus recently after the Ravens won the Super Bowl in February, Pernetti's main message was positive and inspirational -- he wanted Rice to complete his degree. \\"That was what he wanted,\\" Rice told The Star-Ledger. \\"He was telling me that to be a true pillar at Rutgers, I needed to graduate. He wanted me to register for some online courses so I can get that done. I mean, I just won a Super Bowl, and that's what he wanted!\\" Former defensive tackle Eric LeGrand, who was paralyzed as a result of injuries sustained in a 2010 Rutgers game, also backed Pernetti. \\"When you're in a situation like I have been for the past 2½ years, you truly see the character of people,\\" LeGrand told The Star-Ledger. \\"Tim Pernetti has shown me and Rutgers how great of a person he really is, and how much he really cares.\\" On Friday, after learning of Pernetti losing his job, LeGrand tweeted, \\"Heading up to RU in support of Tim Pernetti to talk to some media. #KeepTimPernetti the things this man has done for me is indescribable.\\" Information from ESPN College Insider Brett McMurphy, ESPN.com senior writer Don Van Natta Jr., ESPN.com college football reporter Adam Rittenberg and The Associated Press was used in this report. ||||| Two Rutgers basketball players on Mike Rice's team say the fired coach wasn't the abusive tyrant he appears to be on a widely viewed video that ultimately cost him his job.

(Associated Press) \\"You can't let those individual moments define what he was,\\" junior forward Wally Judge said during a telephone interview Thursday. \\"In my past two years, me being an older guy and being under other coaches, I have grown from the moment I stepped in these doors, not only as a player but also as a person because of how he has treated me.\\" Sophomore forward Austin Johnson agreed. \\"He did a lot for us off the court, academically, socially,\\" he said during a separate telephone conversation. \\"I have to say I enjoyed my time, even it was an emotional rollercoaster.\\" Rice was fired Wednesday, the day after a video aired on ESPN showing him shoving, grabbing and throwing balls at players in practice and using gay slurs. \\"I feel if people had a chance to see the other portions of practice, or had been at practice, their judgment would not be as severe,\\" Johnson said. \\"I am not saying what he did wasn't wrong, because I do believe it was wrong. But it is also tough because it was a highlight reel of his worst moments. \\"I never expected for this to escalate as fast as it did,\\" Johnson said. \\"We have to deal with this and it's new for a lot of the younger guys.\\" Judge believes some of those moments come across worse on camera than they really were. \\"Honestly, a lot of the things that have been seen have been taken out of context. A lot of things that aren't seen are when we grab him and kid around,\\" Judge said. \\"Like I said before, when people ask me why did I play for him, I told them \`He's a players' coach.' \\"Mike was almost like a big brother. He would get on the floor with us and go through drills with us. He made it fun. When you have a big brother-type of figure, you know you can play around like that. I have grabbed Mike and put him in a headlock and we joke around and kid. That was the type of relationship he built with his players.\\" Eric Murdock, former director of player development at Rutgers, put together the video that showed clips of several different practices over three years. In November, he showed it to athletic director Tim Pernetti. The following month, Rice was suspended three games for improper conduct, fined 75,000 and required to take anger management classes. Like the two Rutgers players, Pitt guard Travon Woodall also defended Rice, who recruited him when he was an assistant coach there. \\"They are going at my man Mike Rice too hard,\\" Woodall tweeted. \\"He's the reason I came to Pitt.\\" Woodall later added Rice is \\"not the only coach to put his hands on a player, or talk the way he did.\\" Murdock played in the NBA and was viewed in the program as someone who could mentor players. His contract was not renewed. \\"I have a lot of respect for him. When he was here, he was somebody I would talk to because he knew of my aspirations for playing at the next level and he was a guy who had done it,\\" Judge said. \\"He was a great guy to talk to. As far as this situation goes, I understand everything that is going on; I can't necessarily be mad at him, but it's been blown out of proportion. There are certain ways of going about things and this wasn't the way.\\" Rice left Pitt to coach at Robert Morris before landing at Rutgers, where his record was 44-51 over three seasons. He posted a 16-38 mark in the Big East, after going 73-31 in three seasons at Robert Morris. The Scarlet Knights went 15-16 this season and 5-13 in the league. Rice's assistant, Jimmy Martelli, who was with him at Robert Morris, resigned Thursday. Judge, meantime, insisted Rice wasn't a \\"villain.\\" \\"He wasn't a guy we hated or despised,\\" Judge said. \\"After practice, we would all go in the locker room and laugh. It was never a sad face or a hung head. What he did was he separated the court and he separated life. When we were on the court, we were on the court and locked in. That's why you see so many intense moments because he was so locked in on turning this program around. When we got in the locker room we were a family. We laughed.\\" Johnson hopes Rutgers' next coach can bring success to a program that hasn't been to the NCAA tournament since 1991. \\"I feel like winning solves everything,\\" he said. \\"If we can get someone in and change the culture, I feel like all this stuff will be forgotten.\\" Said Judge: \\"We don't want a white-collar, clean-cut guy. We want somebody who understands us and will push us every day, like Rice did.\\" ||||| ATLANTA — On the same day Rutgers terminated the contract of his boss, Mike Rice, Scarlet Knights assistant men's basketball coach Jimmy Martelli resigned from the program, according to a spokesman in the school's sports information department. Attempts to reach Martelli were unsuccessful, but he released a statement to the Associated Press: “I am sickened that as an assistant coach I contributed in any way to an unacceptable culture. Wednesday I resigned from Rutgers and I hope that coaches on all levels will learn something important from these events,\\" Martelli said. \\"For my actions, I am deeply sorry and I apologize to the players from the bottom of my heart.” In the wake of Rice's firing Wednesday because of the revelations of verbal and physical abuse over a two-year period from practice tapes thrust into the public spotlight, the Scarlet Knights men's basketball program has been thoroughly scrutinized. The 40-minute tape — which was made public in small portions by ESPN's \\"Outside the Lines\\" program earlier this week — contained a number of instances of Rice crossing the line in practice. On a portion of the full tape that did not make airwaves, Martelli was seen shoving an unidentified player twice during a practice. During an impromptu meeting with the media on Tuesday, following the airing of the full tape, Rutgers athletic director Tim Pernetti said that Martelli's involvement had been addressed. \\"Jimmy was spoken to about the matter,\\" Pernetti said earlier this week. \\"We dealt with that. Certainly the tape focused on Mike, but it brought some other things to light that we dealt with at the same time that we dealt with Mike.\\" Martelli, the son of longtime Saint Joseph's head coach Phil Martelli, came to Rutgers when Rice was hired from Robert Morris in May 2010. He was a part of Rice's staff with the Colonials for three seasons from 2007-08 until leaving for the Scarlet Knights program in 2010. He was the first hire that Rice made when he officially arrived on campus. |||||","output":"Tim Pernetti, Rutgers' athletic director, announced his resignation following the release of a video showing basketball coach Mike Rice physically and verbally abusing players during practice.

Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"Step 1: Identify the elements of the statement. - The legacy of Zoroaster - Inspiration for future philosophers - Friedrich Nietzsche Step 2: Research the connection between the elements. Zoroaster, also known as Zarathustra, was an ancient Persian prophet who founded the Zoroastrianism religion around the 6th century BCE. Friedrich Nietzsche was a 19th-century German philosopher, known for his works such as \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\". Step 3: Analyze the connections. Friedrich Nietzsche was indeed interested in the figure of Zarathustra and was inspired by him to some extent. In his book \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\", Nietzsche uses the figure of Zarathustra as a mouthpiece for his own philosophical ideas. However, Nietzsche's philosophy differs significantly from Zoroastrianism, and it is important to note that Nietzsche's Zarathustra is not a direct representation of the historical Zoroaster. Step 4: Assess the verifiability of the statement. The statement, \\"The legacy of Zoroaster inspired future philosophers, such as Friedrich Nietzsche,\\" can be considered as a verifiable fact. There are clear connections between Zoroaster and Nietzsche's works, particularly through the character of Zarathustra in Nietzsche's book. Step 5: Final answer. Yes, the statement can be considered a verifiable fact, with the understanding that the inspiration Nietzsche derived from Zoroaster was not a direct adoption of Zoroastrianism teachings but rather a starting point for his own philosophical exploration."},{"instruction":"Question: You are given a new situation: Two groups of people were part of a science study.

The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate.

The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers.

He stepped down from these and other positions by a series of abdications between 1554 and 1556. Through inheritance, he brought together under his rule extensive territories in western, central, and southern Europe, and the Spanish viceroyalties in the Americas and Asia. Charles fought continually with the Ottoman Empire and its sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent. The defeat of Hungary at the Battle of Mohacs in 1526 \\"sent a wave of terror over Europe.\\" The Muslim advance in Central Europe was halted at the Siege of Vienna in 1529. Suleiman won the contest for mastery of the Mediterranean, in spite of Spanish victories such as the conquest of Tunis in 1535. The regular Ottoman fleet came to dominate the Eastern Mediterranean after its victories at Preveza in 1538 and Djerba in 1560 (shortly after Charles's death), which severely decimated the Spanish marine arm. At the same time, the Muslim Barbary corsairs, acting under the general authority and supervision of the sultan, regularly devastated the Spanish and Italian coasts, crippling Spanish trade and chipping at the foundations of Habsburg power. In 1536 Francis I of France allied himself with Suleiman against Charles. While Francis was persuaded to sign a peace treaty in 1538, he again allied himself with the Ottomans in 1542 in a Franco-Ottoman alliance. In 1543 Charles allied himself with Henry VIII and forced Francis to sign the Truce of Crepy-en-Laonnois. Later, in 1547, Charles signed a humiliating treaty with the Ottomans to gain himself some respite from the huge expenses of their war. Charles V made overtures to the Safavid Empire to open a second front against the Ottomans, in an attempt at creating a Habsburg-Persian alliance.

(Associated Press) U.S. astronaut Nick Hague, member of the main crew to the International Space Station (ISS), waves to his sons from a bus prior to the launch of Soyuz-FG rocket at the Russian leased Baikonur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, Thursday, Oct. 11, 2018. (AP Photo/Dmitri Lovetsky, Pool) (Associated Press) BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan (AP) — The problem came two minutes into the flight: The rocket carrying an American and a Russian to the International Space Station failed Thursday, triggering an emergency that sent their capsule into a steep, harrowing fall back to Earth. The crew landed safely on the steppes of Kazakhstan, but the aborted mission dealt another blow to the troubled Russian space program that currently serves as the only link to deliver astronauts to the orbiting outpost. NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos' Alexei Ovchinin had a brief period of weightlessness when the capsule separated from the malfunctioning Soyuz rocket at an altitude of about 50 kilometers (31 miles), then endured gravitational forces of 6-7 times more than is felt on Earth as they came down at a sharper-than-normal angle. About a half-hour later, the capsule parachuted onto a barren area about 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the city of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan. \\"Thank God the crew is alive,\\" said Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin. He added that Putin received regular updates. New NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, who watched the launch at the Russian-leased Baikonur cosmodrome along with his Russian counterpart, said Hague and Ovchinin were in good condition. He added that a \\"thorough investigation into the cause of the incident will be conducted.\\" All Russian manned launches will be suspended pending an investigation into the cause of the failure, said Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov. Hague, 43, and Ovchinin, 47, lifted off as scheduled at 2:40 p.m. (0840 GMT; 4:40 a.m. EDT) from Baikonur. The astronauts were to dock at the space station six hours after the launch and join an American, a Russian and a German on board. But the three-stage Soyuz booster suffered an unspecified failure of its second stage two minutes after launch. Russian news reports indicated that one of its four first-stage engines might have failed to jettison in sync with others, resulting in the second stage's shutdown and activating the automatic emergency rescue system. Search and rescue teams were immediately scrambled to recover the crew, and paratroopers were dropped from a plane to reach the site quickly. Dzhezkazgan is about 450 kilometers (280 miles) northeast of Baikonur, and spacecraft returning from the space station normally land in that region. The astronauts were flown by helicopter to Dzhezkazgan, where they underwent a medical checkup and then taken by plane to Baikonur for more checks and to see their families. They will spend the night in Baikonur before being flown to Star City, Russia's space training center outside Moscow. It was to be the first space mission for Hague, who joined NASA's astronaut corps in 2013. Ovchinin spent six months on the orbiting outpost in 2016. Oleg Orlov, the head of Russia's main space medicine center, said the higher-than-usual gravity load posed no threat to the astronauts, who have been trained to endure high g-forces. During the launch, astronauts wear spacesuits and are tightly strapped into their customs-made seats helping withstand the G-forces. Flight controllers kept the three space station residents abreast of the situation after Thursday's aborted launch. \\"The boys have landed,\\" Mission Control assured the space station crew. \\"Glad our friends are fine,\\" space station commander Alexander Gerst, a European Space Agency astronaut from Germany, tweeted from orbit. \\"Spaceflight is hard. And we must keep trying for the benefit of humankind.\\" There was no immediate word on whether the space station crew might need to extend its own six-month mission. Two spacewalks planned for later this month were off indefinitely. Hague was supposed to be one of the spacewalkers. NASA said it's dusting off its plans for operating the space station without a crew, just in case the Russian investigation drags into next year. Kenny Todd, a space station manager, said from Houston that the three-member space station crew can stay on board until January. That's just a month beyond their expected mid-December return. Their Soyuz capsule is good for about 200 days in orbit. If the Soyuz rocket remains grounded until it's time for the astronauts to come home, flight controllers could operate the orbiting lab without anyone on board, Todd said. The space station could operate like that indefinitely, barring a major equipment failure, he added. But it will need to be staffed before SpaceX or Boeing launches its new crew capsules next year, Todd said. Given that the space station is a 100 billion asset, Todd says it needs to have someone on board for the arrival of the commercial demo missions, for safety reasons. While the Russian space program has been dogged by a string of launch failures and other mishaps in recent years, Thursday's incident marked the program's first manned launch failure since September 1983, when a Soyuz exploded on the launch pad. Borisov said Russia will fully share all relevant information with the U.S., which pays up to 82 million per ride to the space station. \\"I hope that the American side will treat it with understanding,\\" he said. \\"We will naturally provide them with all the necessary information about what caused the failure.\\" Earlier this week, NASA's Bridenstine emphasized that collaboration with Russia's Roscosmos remains important. Relations between Moscow and Washington have sunk to post-Cold War lows over conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential vote, but they have maintained cooperation in space research. The Russian Soyuz spacecraft is currently the only vehicle for ferrying crews to the space station following the retirement of the U.S. space shuttle fleet. Russia stands to lose that monopoly in the coming years with the arrival of SpaceX's Dragon and Boeing's Starliner crew capsules. The last time the Russian space program had a manned launch failure was in 1983. Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Gennady Strekalov jettisoned and landed safely near the launch pad after the Soyuz explosion. \\"It's an unpleasant situation,\\" Titov told the Tass news agency Thursday. \\"We went through it, and it was very bad.\\" He added that it will take about a week for the crew to fully recover. In 1975, the failure of a Soyuz upper stage sent Vasily Lazarev and Oleg Makarov into a fiery fall to Earth from an altitude of 190 kilometers, subjecting them to enormous gravity loads that caused them to black out and temporarily lose eyesight. They landed on a snowy mountain slope and spent two nights shivering in the cold before rescue crews reached them. Russia has continued to rely on Soviet-designed booster rockets for commercial satellites, as well as crews and cargo to the space station. While Russian rockets had earned a reputation for reliability in the past, launch failures in recent years has called into doubt Russia's ability to maintain the same high standards of manufacturing. Glitches found in Russia's Proton and Soyuz rockets in 2016 were traced to manufacturing flaws. Roscosmos sent more than 70 rocket engines back to production lines to replace faulty components, a move that resulted in a yearlong break in Proton launches and badly dented Russia's niche in the global market for commercial satellite launches. In August, the space station crew spotted a hole in a Russian Soyuz capsule docked to the orbiting outpost that caused a brief loss of air pressure before being patched. Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin has raised wide concern by saying that the leak was a drill hole that was made intentionally during manufacturing or in orbit. He didn't say if he suspected any of the station's crew. ___ Isachenkov reported from Moscow. Associated Press writer Jim Heintz in Moscow and Marcia Dunn in Cape Canaveral contributed. ___ This version was corrected to say that there currently are three astronauts on the space station. ||||| The SpaceX Dragon cargo craft had its stay extended at the International Space Station a few more days.

The Canadarm2 will then be commanded to release Dragon Sunday at 3:36 a.m. EST as astronaut Anne McClain monitors from the cupola. NASA TV will broadcast the departure live without commentary starting Sunday at 3:15 a.m. Today, the three space station residents are back on science and maintenance duties with Dragon poised for a weekend departure. McClain of NASA is checking out and preserving the space research meant for return inside Dragon. Flight Engineer David Saint-Jacques of the Canadian Space Agency assisted McClain first thing Thursday morning. He then moved on to the Vascular Echo study scanning his leg’s femoral artery with an ultrasound device to understand how living in space affects the cardiovascular system. Cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko explored ways to improve piloting techniques in space and participated in a psychological assessment. The four-time station resident also maintained Russian life support systems aboard the orbital lab.

The spacecraft experienced a malfunction two minutes into the flight, triggering an emergency landing in Kazakhstan. Both astronauts walked away unharmed, but all Russian manned launches have been suspended pending an investigation into the incident. This marks the program's first manned launch failure since 1983. Following the retirement of the US space shuttle fleet, the Russian Soyuz spacecraft is the only vehicle for ferrying crew to the space station, although the arrival of SpaceX's Dragon and Boeing's Starliner crew capsules is expected to end Russia's monopoly shortly."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Information available In this section, you will find information regarding:\\" to French?","output":"Dans cette section, vous trouverez des informations concernant : \\"Information available In this section, you will find information regarding:\\" can be translated to French as \\"Informations disponibles Dans cette section, vous trouverez des informations concernant :\\".

This process ensures a smooth texture without curdling or separating. Here's a step-by-step guide to tempering batter: Step 1: Prepare the ingredients Gather and measure all the ingredients needed for your batter. It's essential to have all ingredients accessible and at the correct temperatures to ensure the tempering process works. Step 2: Warm the hotter ingredient(s) and portion it If you're using chocolate, for example, you'll want to melt it over a double boiler or in the microwave. Once it's smooth and warm, set it aside. Portion a small amount (about 1/4 of the total melted ingredient) to add to the cold batter in Step 3. Step 3: Gradually add warm ingredient to cold batter Slowly and gradually add the small portion of the warmed ingredient to the cold batter, whisking gently to combine. This process helps raise the temperature of the cold batter without drastically changing its consistency. Step 4: Monitor the temperature Check the batter's temperature by either using a thermometer or by touching it with a clean finger. The goal is for the batter to be slightly warmer than room temperature, so it's crucial not to overheat it. Step 5: Mix remaining ingredients Once the batter has reached the desired temperature, continue to add the rest of the warm ingredient in a slow, steady stream, continuously whisking. Step 6: Blend thoroughly and check consistency After incorporating both ingredients together, make sure to blend them thoroughly and check the consistency. The batter should be smooth and uniform in texture. Step 7: Continue with the recipe Now that your batter is tempered, you can proceed with your recipe. Cook or bake your dish as per the instructions in the recipe. Remember, patience is key when tempering batter. Gradually incorporating the warmer ingredients and continuously whisking are crucial for a properly tempered batter."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options.

Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands. Which parcel of land had an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the two parcels of land step-by-step and justify our conclusion: Step 1: Understand the properties of each parcel Tom's land is forested, which means it has an abundance of trees, shrubs, and other vegetation. Bill's land, on the other hand, is covered with grasslands, which typically consist of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Step 2: Evaluate the water retention capacity of each parcel Forested land has a higher water retention capacity compared to grasslands. The trees and other plants in the forest help to retain water in the soil through their extensive root systems. Moreover, the forest floor is often covered with leaves and organic matter, which can further slow down the percolation of water into the soil. In grasslands, the root systems of grasses may not be as extensive as those of trees, and there is less organic matter on the ground to slow down the water percolation. Step 3: Determine which parcel is more likely to have excess water percolating downward Considering the factors in Steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that the parcel of land with an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers is more likely to be Tom's forested land than Bill's grassland. The presence of trees and other vegetation, along with the forest floor's ability to slow down water percolation, increases the likelihood of excess water being retained in the soil and then percolating downward in Tom's parcel."},{"instruction":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"(B).\\" sentiment (OPTIONS: (A). negative (B). positive).","output":"This movie was really fun and amazing, like a big rainbow or playing with your favorite toys!

How many more hours does she have to work to buy the TV?","output":"Step 1: Calculate Latia's monthly earnings Latia earns 10 per hour and works for 30 hours per week. Weekly earnings = hourly rate x hours worked per week = 10 x 30 = 300 per week She works for a month, so assuming 4 weeks per month: Monthly earnings = weekly earnings x number of weeks in a month = 300 x 4 = 1200 Step 2: Calculate the additional amount Latia needs to buy the Samsung TV Latia wants to buy a TV worth 1700. We need to find out how much more money she needs after her monthly earnings.

Today, we're going to talk about literacy averages in cities and countries. We'll figure out which one is usually lower - city or national averages! So let's be detectives and solve this question together! First, let's understand what literacy means. Literacy means being able to read and write. We measure how many people can read and write in a city or a country to find the literacy average. Now, let's learn two big words - city average and national average. City average is the average of people who can read and write in a city, like your hometown. National average means the average of people who can read and write in the whole country, from big cities to small towns and villages. Imagine a big pizza! The whole pizza is the national average, and each slice is a city average. Some slices might have more cheese (more people who can read and write), while some have less. So, which one is lower? It's not the same for every country. In some countries, the city average is lower, while in others, the national average is lower. It depends on how many people can read and write in different places of the country. Often, big cities have more schools and teachers than small towns and villages. So, people living in cities might be more likely to learn to read and write. In these places, the city average could be higher than the national average. But sometimes, the city average could be lower too. It might be because of challenges people face in cities, like not having enough time or money to go to school and learn. So, dear little detectives, we have found the answer to our question! It's not always the same. Sometimes the city literacy average is lower, and sometimes the national literacy average is lower. It depends on the country and the people living there. Keep asking questions and exploring the world around you! You are growing up to be amazing and super smart!"},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

A more complete review might give us a thorough understanding of these minor criticisms. However, solely based on the given review, we can conclude that the reviewer has a positive opinion towards the movie since the observational feedback is affirmative. They appreciate the fact that the movie works beautifully and reaffirms the integrity of the opera, denoting a successful adaptation, which is often seen as a challenging task in the movie industry. This sign of admiration and the lack of any actual direct criticism imply that the reviewer enjoyed the movie overall and thus viewed it positively. It is crucial to mention that 'positive opinion' doesn't necessarily imply perfection; it simply suggests an overall approval or a favorable response. To summarize, the text's tone, the adjective use, and the acknowledgment of successful adaptation from opera to movie all contribute towards understanding that the opinion expressed in the review is indeed positive."},{"instruction":"A wet towel will dry when it is left in the Sun. Which process occurs to make this happen? Choices: (A). melting. (B). boiling. (C). condensation. (D). evaporation.","output":"The correct answer is (D). Evaporation. A wet towel drying in the sun goes through the process of evaporation, which is a type of vaporization. Evaporation is the transition of liquid water into water vapor at the surface of the liquid without boiling. This process occurs when the sun's energy heats the water molecules on the towel's surface, providing them with enough energy to break their weak hydrogen bonds and escape as vapor into the atmosphere. In detail, here's what happens during the process: 1. Absorption of sun's energy: When the wet towel is exposed to sunlight, the incident solar radiation provides the energy required for the water molecules to evaporate. These molecules absorb the sun's energy in the form of heat, which increases their kinetic energy. 2. Breakage of hydrogen bonds: Water molecules in the liquid phase are held together by hydrogen bonds, which are relatively weak. As they absorb energy from the sun, the water molecules become increasingly agitated and move more rapidly. This increased motion enables them to overcome the attractive forces of the hydrogen bonds. 3. Escape of water molecules into the atmosphere: Once the water molecules have gained enough kinetic energy, they can escape from the liquid phase into the gaseous phase. This process is called evaporation. The water molecules leave the wet towel and transition into water vapor, which then disperses into the surrounding air. 4. Drying of the towel: As more and more water molecules escape, the amount of liquid water on the towel decreases, and the towel starts to dry. It is important to note that evaporation is a surface phenomenon. This means that only the water molecules at the surface of the towel are involved in this process. Additionally, evaporation is a cooling process. As the water molecules with the highest kinetic energy escape the surface, they take away their heat with them, leaving behind the cooler and less energetic molecules. This is why a wet towel feels cooler when the wind or a soft breeze blows over it. Evaporation differs from the other options in the following ways: (A). Melting: Melting is the transition from a solid to a liquid state due to the absorption of energy. This process involves breaking the bonds between molecules in the solid phase to change them into the liquid phase, and it is not relevant to the stated problem since the wet towel is not in a solid state. (B). Boiling: Boiling is the process where a liquid turns into vapor when it is heated to its boiling point. This occurs throughout the entire liquid, not just the surface, unlike evaporation. In the context of the wet towel, boiling is not applicable, as the sun's energy is unlikely to raise the temperature of the water to its boiling point. (C). Condensation: Condensation is the conversion of a vapor or gas to a liquid. It occurs when water vapor loses energy and turns back into liquid droplets. This process is opposite to evaporation, and it does not explain how a wet towel dries in the sun."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Hannah (1868–November 1875) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and the second horse to win the English Fillies Triple Crown.

You need to create a question that can be answered from the story.

As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning. In the small town of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts, Norman Babcock (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an 11-year-old boy who speaks with the dead, including his late grandmother (Elaine Stritch) and various ghosts in town. Almost no one believes him and he is isolated emotionally from his family while being ridiculed by his peers. His best friend, Neil Downe (Tucker Albrizzi), is an overweight boy who is bullied himself and finds in Norman a kindred spirit. During rehearsal of a school play commemorating the town's execution of a witch three centuries ago, Norman has a vision of the town's past in which he is pursued through the woods by townsfolk on a witch hunt. Afterward, the boys are confronted by Norman's estranged and seemingly deranged uncle Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman) who tells his nephew that he soon must take up his regular ritual to protect the town. Soon after this encounter, Prenderghast dies from a sudden stroke. During the official performance of the school play Norman has another vision, creating a public spectacle of himself which leads to his father Perry (Jeff Garlin) grounding him. His mother Sandra (Leslie Mann) tells him that his father's stern manner is because he is afraid for him. The next day, Norman sees Prenderghast's spirit who tells him that the ritual must be performed with a certain book before sundown that day; then making him swear to complete the task, Prenderghast's spirit is set free and crosses over. Norman is at first reluctant to go because he is scared but his grandmother tells him it is all right to be scared as long as he does not let it change who he is. Norman sets off to retrieve the book from Prenderghast's house (having to take it from his corpse). He then goes to the graves of the five men and two women who were cursed by the witch, but finds that the book is merely a series of fairy tales. Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a school bully, arrives and prevents Norman from reading the story before sundown. Norman attempts to continue reading from the book, to no effect. A ghostly storm resembling the witch appears in the air, summoning the cursed dead to arise as zombies, who chase the boys along with Norman's 17-year-old sister, Courtney (Anna Kendrick) and Neil's older brother, Mitch (Casey Affleck) down the hill and into town. Having realized that the witch was not buried in the graveyard, Norman contacts classmate Salma (who tells them to access the Town Hall's archives for the location of the witch's unmarked grave) for help. As the kids make their way to the Town Hall, the zombies are attacked by the citizenry. During the riot, Norman and his companions break into the archives but cannot find the information they need. As the mob moves to attack Town Hall, the witch storm appears over the crowd. Norman climbs the Hall's tower to read the book, in a last-ditch effort to finish the ritual, but the witch strikes the book with lightning, hurling Norman from the tower and deep into the archives. Unconscious, Norman has a dream where he learns that the witch was Agatha Prenderghast (Jodelle Ferland), a little girl of his age who was also a medium. Norman realizes that Agatha was wrongfully convicted by the town council when they mistook her powers for witchcraft. After awakening, Norman encounters the zombies and recognizes them as the town council who convicted Agatha. The zombies admit that they only wanted to speak with him to ensure that he would take up the ritual, to minimize the damage of the mistake they made so long ago. Norman attempts to help the zombies slip away so they can guide him to Agatha's grave, but is cornered by the mob. Courtney and the kids confronts the crowd and convinces them to back off, arguing that their rage, fear, and misunderstanding make them no different than the cursed townsfolk from long ago. Judge Hopkins (Bernard Hill) guides Norman's family to the grave in a forest. Before the grave is reached, Agatha's magical powers separate Norman from the others. Norman finds the grave and interacts with Agatha who has become a vengeful spirit/poltergeist in the spirit dimension, determined to stop the cataclysmic tantrum she has been having over the years. She asks him to leave her be, but Norman holds his ground, telling her he understands how she feels as an outcast. Norman endures her assault and eventually convinces her that her vengeance is accomplishing nothing and persuades her to stop. Norman tells her that there must have been someone who was kind to her. Agatha recalls happy memories with her mother. At last, having finally encountered someone who understands her plight, she is able to find a measure of peace and cross over to the afterlife. The storm dissipates, and she and the zombies all fade away. The town cleans up and regards Norman as a hero. In the end, Norman watches a horror film with the ghost of his grandmother and his family, who have grown to accept Norman for who he is.

Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law. After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be..., what would be the answer ?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose bacteria is on the skin and is ingested happens, how will it affect bacteria will enter the bloodstream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?

Bacteria enters the bloodstream. 3. Cells in the body are attacked. 4. Cells are killed. 5. Different kinds of sickness are formed. Perturbation Hypothesis: Suppose bacteria is on the skin and is ingested, will it have any effect on the aforementioned process? To answer this question, we must first understand how bacteria on the skin might enter the body when ingested and if it has direct or indirect effects on the process. When bacteria are present on the skin, they can be transferred to the mouth and ingested via direct touch (e.g., touching the mouth with unwashed hands) or indirect contact (e.g., through contaminated food or utensils). Once the bacteria have been ingested, they will enter the gastrointestinal tract, specifically the stomach and intestines. The stomach has a highly acidic environment with a pH around 1.5 to 3.5. This acidic environment functions as a defense mechanism against ingested pathogens, as it can kill or deactivate many types of bacteria. However, some bacteria are capable of surviving in this harsh environment, such as Helicobacter pylori, which is responsible for stomach ulcers. Other bacteria may be present in food that has been stored or prepared improperly, leading to foodborne illnesses. Once the bacteria have survived the stomach's acidity, they can enter the intestinal tract, where they can adhere to the mucosal surfaces or invade the epithelial cells lining the intestines. From here, bacteria may enter the bloodstream either directly, by breaching the intestinal barrier, or indirectly, by producing toxins that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. The direct access of bacteria into the bloodstream can result in bacteremia -- the presence of bacteria in the blood. This occurrence can potentially lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition as a result of the body's response to an infection, and can progress to septic shock. In these cases, the process described above is affected as bacteria will enter the bloodstream and may attack cells in the body, leading to cell death and the formation of different sicknesses. Alternatively, the indirect effect of ingested bacteria on the bloodstream can happen when they produce toxins within the gastrointestinal tract that are then absorbed into the bloodstream. These toxins can cause damage to cells and tissues throughout the body, including the liver and kidneys. This pathway also has the potential to affect the process by causing the cells in the body to be attacked, leading to cell death and the development of various illnesses. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis does have potential direct and indirect effects on the process. When bacteria on the skin are ingested, they might be able to enter the bloodstream either directly by breaching the intestinal barrier, or indirectly by producing toxins that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This can lead to the body's cells being attacked, cell death, and the subsequent development of different sicknesses. However, it is essential to note that not all ingested bacteria will have these effects, as some pathogens may be killed or deactivated in the stomach's acidic environment or are unable to invade the intestinal barrier."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence in Spanish.","output":"\\"El gato está en la caja\\" - This sentence means \\"The cat is in the box\\" in Spanish.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs. What pet did Chan have? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. not enough information B. a chameleon C. an origami bird D. a grubworm A:","output":"B. a chameleon"},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries.

Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current campus opened in 1916 and extends over along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. - MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) is a research institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology formed by the 2003 merger of the Laboratory for Computer Science and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Housed within the Stata Center, CSAIL is the largest on-campus laboratory as measured by research scope and membership. - Electrical engineering is a field of engineering that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electric power distribution and use. Subsequently, broadcasting and recording media made electronics part of daily life. The invention of the transistor, and later the integrated circuit, brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object. - Silvio Micali ( born October 13 , 1954 ) is an Italian - born computer scientist at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a professor of computer science in MIT 's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science since 1983 .

The term \\"data integrity\\" is broad in scope and may have widely different meanings depending on the specific context even under the same general umbrella of computing. This article provides only a broad overview of some of the different types and concerns of data integrity. - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.
