A new Blade Runner - future noir at it's most gritty. The vision of Paris is superb, both recognisable and visionary, with sweeping vistas, grungy set pieces and futuristic virtual reality. The story line is quite simple, with few surprises, but that's not what I like most about the film. It is a visual treat. Done in 3D and rendered in black and white (no greys!) with only one short spot of colour, it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds. There are many \\"arty\\" camera shots - closeups and odd viewpoints - but that just adds to the temperament of the film. Overall you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage form. I was initially under the impression that the film had been rotoscoped, such was the level of animation and high detail in the character's facial expressions. But unlike \\"A Scanner Darkly\\" - which suffers from (or indeed is enhanced by) inconsistent character definition (just watch the way some of the hair changes shape!) - Renaissance is consistent and precise throughout. When the character is in close-up, added details and texture can bee seen, but when in mid-shot or further away details are omitted, but not to the detriment of character definition. For me, the only down side of the film is that in one commentary we are told that this is a one-off project. Such a shame, as I would like to see more of this futuristic film-noir storyline and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style. Oh, and the English dub is great too. All in all a great film and highly recommended. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, answer the following question. When will fresh skin cells ready for treatment occur when cleansing skin?

Start by educating yourself about how pregnancy starts. Many studies have found that the better education you have regarding how sex and pregnancy work, the better able you will be to make good decisions regarding sex. You can find lots of high quality information online using sources like Mayo Clinic and Wikipedia. The short version is that a man produces a substance in his body, called semen, which exits his body through the penis. This substance is deposited in a woman’s vagina (through sex or other means), where it combines with an egg in her uterus to form a baby. Women only have eggs in their uterus sometimes and even then, the egg doesn’t always get what it needs from the semen. This is why you won’t get pregnant every time you have sex. There are lots of myths about how you can get pregnant. If you know the truth from the facts, you’ll be much better able to protect yourself. Remember, when it doubt, play it safe. It’s better to wait until you have proper protection than risk getting pregnant because of something you read on Tumblr. Myth: “You can’t get pregnant if you have sex during your period.” Your body will usually release an egg half-way in between your periods...but loads of women can have an egg release just about any time in their cycle. In fact, this method may be more likely to get some women pregnant, so don’t rely on this to help you. Myth: “You can’t get pregnant if you use the pull-out method.” The pull-out method is when the guy pulls his penis out of the vagina before ejaculating or “cumming” (orgasming and releasing his semen). The problem is that the penis will release fluid before ejaculation that can still get a girl pregnant! Using the pull-out method is very unreliable and for most people, the chances of getting pregnant with this form of “birth control” is about 30%. Myth: “You can’t get pregnant if you use certain positions or have sex in certain places.” It doesn’t matter if you’re having sex in a pool/hot tub or if the girl is on top during sex. If there’s a penis in a vagina, pregnancy can happen. Myth: “You can get pregnant if you do _______ afterwards.” Unless that blank is filled with medication or medical devices like Plan B or an IUD, then this is a total myth. Jumping jacks, douching, showering, peeing, eating certain foods: you name it, these things won’t help keep you from getting pregnant. We don’t want to sound like that guy at your church, but abstinence really is your best bet at not getting pregnant. Even the most effective forms of birth control only work most of the time. If you want to guarantee that you won’t get pregnant, find other ways of getting sexual release that don’t involve penetration. Pregnancy isn’t the only risk of sex, either. It’s important to remember that. You also need to be safe and use protection to keep yourself from getting STDs. There are also merits to taking things slow, in your relationship. While sex is fun and feels good, it adds a lot of complication. You might think you’ll have fewer problems once you start having sex but really you’ll have more. This is why, if you can make it work, it’s better to stay abstinent until you’re in a place in your life where you’re better able to deal with those complications. Full, penetrative sex isn’t the only way to get sexual release. If you don’t have access to birth control or if you just want to be super sure that you don't get pregnant or get anyone else pregnant, try other ways of getting physical that don't lead to babies. Try something like mutual masturbation. This is where you stimulate yourself in front of your partner or you stimulate each other. As long as no penetration occurs and the man's semen is kept away from the vagina, no pregnancy can occur. This is also relatively safe in terms of protecting you from disease. You can try something like oral or anal sex. This should still be done with a condom, however, because both can still spread disease and infections. Talk to an adult that you trust about sex, sexual health, relationships, and pregnancy. They should at least be able to give you some advice. They might even be able to help you find resources so that you can better protect yourself from getting pregnant. Schedule some private time to talk with them and then tell them why you want to talk. It might be awkward at first and it might take more than one conversation, but you’ll find that having someone who can help you will make you much more comfortable and happy. Say something like, “Brian, I’m not comfortable going to mom and dad, but I really want to get intimate with my girlfriend and I’m worried about her getting pregnant. Can you help me choose the right condoms?” In lots of states, you can get birth control from doctors and pharmacies without your parents legally needing to be told. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to your family about your situation, make an appointment with an organization like Planned Parenthood. They’ll educate you and get you everything that you need at a price you can afford, so that your parents don’t need to know about what you’re doing. You can find your local Planned Parenthood clinic by visiting their website. If you live outside the US or in an area not serviced by Planned Parenthood, check with your local health department to get advice about what services might be available to you. There are lots of reasons that you might want to stay away from drugs and alcohol, but one of the major ones is that both can lead you to make really bad decisions. When you’re drunk or high, your brain doesn’t work as well as normal (that’s why it feels so good). This means that while you might normally make the smart choice and use a condom, your drunk brain doesn’t even consider it. You also have to worry about what might happen while you’re passed out. When you’ve had so much alcohol or enough drugs to make it so that you can’t move or are passed out, you have no control over what other people do to your body. For example, more than 20% of teen pregnancies were the result of sex that was influenced by alcohol.

Question: suppose magma is spread out so cooling occurs more quickly happens, how will it affect less minerals are formed. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"The process you're referring to is called igneous petrogenesis, which is essentially the process by which igneous rocks (which are formed through the solidification of magma or lava) are created. Magma, which is molten rock beneath the earth's surface, solidifies as it cools. As it solidifies, minerals begin to form due to the condensation of atoms. The type and size of the minerals formed typically depend on the rate of cooling. Fast cooling of magma (or lava on the surface of the earth) results in smaller mineral grains and thus forms fine-grained rocks, like basalts or pegmatites. This is because when magma cools quickly, the atoms in the magma have less time to arrange themselves into large, well-organized mineral structures. Consequently, the crystals of minerals that form are much smaller. In the case of very rapid cooling (as in the case of volcanic glass or obsidian), there may be no visible mineral crystals at all, the atoms arrange themselves into a glass-like structure instead. Slow cooling of magma, on the other hand, leads to the formation of larger crystal grains, forming coarse-grained rocks like granites. This is because if magma cools slowly, it gives atoms ample time to arrange themselves into large, well-formed crystals, thus creating bigger and well-defined mineral structures. Going back to your question, if magma is spread out so that cooling occurs more quickly, fewer minerals will form. It won't mean that there are fewer different types of minerals, but the overall size of the mineral crystals would be smaller. So, it's true that quick cooling affects the size of minerals rather than the amount. So, the precise answer to your question depends on what you mean by “less minerals are formed.” If this refers to the size of the mineral structures, then fewer or smaller minerals (B: less) might be said to form from a fast-cooling magma. But if this refers to the overall mineralogical composition, the quick cooling might not have a significant impact (C: no effect), as the minerals would still form, but they may be smaller or less well-formed. Rapid cooling also affects the texture of the resulting rock. Rocks that cool quickly will generally be less coarse and have a smoother texture, as the small mineral crystals do not interlock as much as larger ones. This could make the rock potentially less durable or strong, as the structure is not as interlocked and robust as that of a slowly-cooled, coarse-grained rock. Therefore, the way in which the magma cools can significantly impact not just the size of the mineral crystals that form but also the texture, durability, and other physical properties of the resulting rock. A quick cooling process will generally lead to smaller mineral formations and a less rugged texture, whereas a slow cooling process allows for the development of larger mineral formations and a coarser texture. This distinction is important in the field of geology, as it helps geologists infer the history and nature of volcanic activities that produce different types of igneous rocks."},{"instruction":"¿Eres Moshi, verdad?

Darren Feldman was given £20,000 compensation after a tribunal agreed his position at HCA International had become intolerable. A Jewish surveyor received £20,000 in compensation today after a tribunal found that his bullying boss repeatedly taunted him and said he wanted to lock up and gas 'Yids' like Apprentice star Lord Sugar’s son. Darren Feldman’s manager Chris Oates also repeatedly invited him to JuJu, an exclusive champagne bar on London’s King’s Road and mocked Jewish Tottenham football fans. Mr Oates also said he wanted to run past the club’s White Hart Lane stadium wearing an Arsenal top with ‘IVOR 4 SKIN’ printed on the back. Referring to Lord Sugar’s son Daniel, with whom he was negotiating a deal, Mr Oates said: 'Quite frankly they’re all a bunch of Yids. I’d like to lock them in the building and gas them all.' A panel at Central London employment tribunal ruled that Mr Feldman, 33, was hounded out of his £47,500-a-year job with private hospital group HCA International. It found the firm and Mr Oates guilty of race and religious discrimination and harassment, ruling that Mr Feldman was constructively dismissed. Mr Feldman, of Teddington, south-west London, was awarded £15,000 for injury to feelings and £5,000 for lost earnings. Speaking after the tribunal, Mr Feldman said: 'I am very relieved by this outcome. I was so disturbed by my treatment at HCA and it is a shame the company fought this to the end. 'I hope HCA takes action to make sure this never happens again.' HCA’s London hospitals also include. the Portland, Princess Grace, Wellington, Lister, London Bridge, Harley Street Clinic, and Harley Street at University College Hospital. Mr. Feldman’s solicitor Shilpen Savani of law firm DWFM Beckman, said:. 'This is an extreme instance of an employer failing to safeguard an. employee. 'Mr Feldman should never have been subjected to such abuse.' Giving evidence, qualified surveyor Mr Feldman told how he joined HCA as a construction project manager in April last year. Colleagues soon learned that he was Jewish when he showed them a tattoo in Hebrew on his ankle. He told how director of estates and projects Mr Oates, who is in his 40s and not Jewish, called him into his office. Mr Feldman (pictured above) alleged that on his boss's birthday,. the pair discussed doing a potential business deal with Daniel Sugar,. son of Apprentice star Lord Sugar, when Mr Oates made the remarks. Mr. Feldman said: 'Chris asked me what I thought of the idea of his to run. down White Hart Lane wearing an Arsenal football top with the writing. ‘IVOR 4 SKIN’ on the back. He wrote it out on a piece of scrap paper. 'This was a derogatory and offensive. reference to the fact that Tottenham Hotspur Football Club is known to. have a large contingent of Jewish supporters. 'I did not know how to answer that question as I was shocked and offended.' Mr Feldman said that his tormentor then looked up bar JuJu on an iPad and showed him the search results. 'Chris. then asked if I wanted to go to a club after work which is located. along King's Road called JuJu. He pointed his finger at me saying \\"want. to go to JuJu, Juju?\\" repeating it several times in an intimidating. manner.' 'Chris was not only a bully in the way that he treated me but he was also seriously abusive towards me because I was Jewish.'

It. will be the second payout by American firm HCA, the world’s largest. private hospital group, in recent years after a race discrimination. claim. HCA and Mr Oates strenuously denied Mr Feldman's allegations. A. string of HCA witnesses including Mr Oates, who remains at the firm,. had also denied Mr Feldman’s allegations of racism but the tribunal. rejected their evidence. HCA said that it is 'deeply disappointed' by the judgment and considering an appeal. A. spokesperson said: 'HCA has a clear code of conduct around acceptable,. professional and ethical behaviour and offers an inclusive, open and. supportive working environment for all our staff.' In 2009, Spanish. electrician Juan Ignacio alleged that he was nicknamed ‘Manuel’ after. the Fawlty Towers waiter by workmates at HCA’s London Bridge Hospital. He. complained he was taunted with the famous ‘I know nothing’ and ‘Que?’ catchphrases used by Andrew Sachs’s iconic sitcom character.

He is madly in love with his \\"friendly cousin\\" (they were not actually related as cousins), the beautiful Roxane; however, he does not believe she will requite his love because he considers himself physically unattractive, because of his over large nose. Soon, he finds that Roxane has become infatuated with Christian de Neuvillette, a dashing new recruit to the Cadets de Gascogne, the military unit in which Cyrano is serving. Christian however, despite his good looks, is tongue-tied when speaking with women. Seeing an opportunity to vicariously declare his love for Roxane, he decides to aid Christian, who does not know how to court a woman and gain her love. Cyrano aids Christian, writing love letters and poems describing the very emotions that Cyrano himself feels for Roxane. Roxane begins to appreciate Christian, not only for his good looks but also his apparent eloquence. She eventually falls in love with him and they contract a secret marriage in order to thwart the plans of the Comte de Guiche, an arrogant nobleman who is himself a frustrated wooer of Roxane. In revenge, De Guiche summons Christian to fight in the war against the Spanish. The war is harsh and brutal: the Cadets de Gascogne are starving. Cyrano escapes over enemy lines each morning to deliver a love letter written by Cyrano himself but signed with Christian's name, sent to Roxane. Christian, at this time, is completely unaware of Cyrano's doings on his behalf. The love letters Cyrano writes eventually draw Roxane out from the city of Paris to the war front. She had come to visit Christian, the supposed romantic poet. Apparently, she admitted that she would rather love an ugly, but great poet, than a handsome, dimwitted fellow.

In the first sentence: The first trustees were Robert Hall (Chairman), David Limond Murdoch, Mielziner Arthur Myers, and Alfred Seymour Bankart. It communicates that the first trustees comprised of four people: Robert Hall, who is the Chairman, David Limond Murdoch, Mielziner Arthur Myers, and Alfred Seymour Bankart. The term \\"Chairman\\" is placed in parentheses immediately after Robert Hall's name, indicating that he holds the position of Chairman. In the second sentence: The first trustees were David Limond Murdoch, Arthur Mielziner Myers (chairman), Robert Hall, and Alfred Seymour Bankart. The information remains the same, but the names are arranged in a different order and the title \\"chairman\\" is placed in parentheses after Arthur Mielziner Myers, indicating that he holds the position of Chairman. The title \\"chairman\\" is placed next to Arthur Mielziner Myers instead of next to Robert Hall, which contradicts the first sentence's placement of the title. However, since both sentences convey the same meaning in terms of the first trustees and the chairman, the placement of the title may be interpreted as a typographical error.

The discrepancies in name arrangements and the placement of the title \\"chairman\\" can be considered minor and do not significantly alter the intended message."},{"instruction":"Write highlights for this article: BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The notorious Iraq prison once called Abu Ghraib has reopened under Iraqi government control. And the Ministry of Justice has launched a public-relations campaign to show it has changed since the days when prisoners were tortured there -- first under Saddam Hussein, and later by American troops. The Iraqi Ministry of Justice gave journalists an inside look at the prison formerly known as Abu Ghraib. It is now called Baghdad Central Prison, and has water fountains, a freshly planted garden and a gym -- complete with weights and sports teams' jerseys on the walls. Under Saddam Hussein, tens of thousands of Iraqis were thrown behind bars here. There were horrific stories of torture, abuse, execution without trial. In 2004, the prison was once again thrown into the international spotlight, this time because of abuse by U.S. troops. Watch how the prison has been revamped ». Detainees were photographed in degrading positions, as Americans posed next to them smiling. The images -- naked prisoners stacked on top of each other, or being threatened by dogs, or hooded and wired up as if for electrocution -- caused outrage around the world when they were leaked to the news media in May 2004. Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, commander of the Abu Ghraib prison at the time, was demoted in rank to colonel because of the scandal. Seven low-ranking guards and two military intelligence soldiers -- described by then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as \\"bad apples\\" -- were disciplined after the scandal surfaced. Rumsfeld later said the day the scandal broke was the worst in his tenure as defense secretary. \\"Clearly the worst day was Abu Ghraib, and seeing what went on there and feeling so deeply sorry that that happened,\\" Rumsfeld said shortly before leaving office at the end of 2006. \\"I remember being stunned by the news of the abuse.\\" The United States always denied it was a matter of policy to torture detainees. But it shut down Abu Ghraib in September 2006 and turned the facility over to the Iraqis. They have revamped and reopened it. Rooms have been transformed and renovated. CNN was told, but not shown, that a few hundred prisoners are here already, in a revamped part of the facility that can hold up to 3,000 prisoners. The capacity is critical to help deal with overcrowding at Iraq's other facilities and the potential security threat. The Iraqi government is going to great lengths to try to change the image this facility has. It organized a tour for journalists, very carefully orchestrated by the Ministry of Justice. Murtada Sharif, the only Ministry of Justice official to speak to CNN on camera about the prison, admitted Abu Ghraib is synonymous in people's minds with the inhumane acts that took place there both before and after the fall of Saddam in 2003. \\"We want to change its image, to make it a place of justice,\\" he said. A wing that used to hold a thousand prisoners In Saddam Hussein's time now is ready for 160. Cells that used to hold between 30 and 50 people now have a capacity of eight. Prisoners and their families actually get to see each other -- the prisoners behind a cage-like structure, the families on the other side of the fence, in a courtyard with a playground for the children. Again, it is part of the whole effort to create a different atmosphere. But human rights organizations in Iraq say abuse and torture remain routine in Iraq's detention facilities. Changing Abu Ghraib's infamous reputation may take more than fresh paint and fake flowers. Highlights:","output":"1.

Second question: Is there hope in my ex wanting to get back with me? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices: a). no; b). yes;","output":"b). yes; These two questions are indeed asking the same thing, as both questions seek to explore the possibility of an ex-partner wanting to rekindle a romantic relationship. While they are phrased differently, the core concern expressed in both questions is the same. To address the matter, it is essential to consider various aspects of the situation, and not just the way your ex talks to you. The fact that your ex still talks to you the same way as before might signal that they still feel comfortable communicating with you. However, this could also mean that they are attempting to maintain a healthy friendship or just remaining cordial despite the breakup. Whether or not there is hope of getting back together requires analyzing more variables. Some factors you may want to consider include: 1. Mutual feelings: Do both you and your ex still have feelings for each other? Sometimes, after a breakup, feelings can linger, but it is essential to assess whether this will lead to a healthy, loving relationship when you get back together. 2. Understanding the reasons for the breakup: Reflecting on the causes of the breakup can illuminate whether the same issues might resurface if you were to get back together. If the problems seem resolvable or are now in the past, the chances of having a successful, renewed relationship might be higher. 3. Communication: Open and honest communication is key in determining whether your ex has any interest in rekindling the relationship. Discussing the matter with your ex will be more reliable than making assumptions based on how they talk to you. 4. Assessing personal growth: Have you or your ex grown, changed, or evolved since the breakup? Personal growth can ignite new hope in a relationship, especially if the growth has led to tangible self-improvement and lessons learned from past mistakes or shortcomings. 5. Timing and external factors: Sometimes, external factors unrelated to the relationship can influence whether getting back together is feasible, such as long-distance, work, or other life circumstances. In conclusion, while the way your ex talks to you might provide some indication of their feelings towards you, it is not enough to discern whether they genuinely want to get back together. Taking into account the aspects listed above, as well as engaging in open communication, can help determine the possibility of rekindling your relationship."},{"instruction":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Participantswhoviolatethisrulewillbesubjecttopenalty,includingdisqualification.","output":"The seemingly unconnected and jumbled characters mentioned above form a meaningful sentence when written correctly.

A:","output":"Charles Timothy Slack's biography provides various pieces of information about his personal and professional life. 1. Full Name: His full name is Charles Timothy Slack. The use of his middle name suggests that he might be generally referred to as \\"Timothy\\" or \\"Tim\\". 2. Date of Birth and Death: Timothy Slack was born on April 11, 1913, and he died in June 1976. This means that at the time of his death, he was 63 years old. Thus, we can gather that he lived through significant periods of American and global history, including both World Wars, the Great Depression, and the initial stages of the Cold War. 3. Political Affiliation: Slack was a member of the Republican Party. This provides information about his ideological perspective and general stance on economic and social issues, assuming his views aligned with typical Republican viewpoints during his lifetime. 4. Professional Life: He served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, marking him as a significant political figure within the state. However, the biography doesn't specify the precise years of his tenure, the specific district he represented, or the issues he championed while in office. 5. Residence: Given his political role, it can be inferred that Timothy Slack resided in Pennsylvania for at least a portion of his life, although the biography doesn't provide further details about his life outside of his political career. 6. Nationality: As he was a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, it can be deduced that he was an American citizen. However, Timothy Slack's biography does lack details on various aspects. For example, it provides no information about his early life, educational background, family life, or career progression. Likewise, the biography also doesn't present any details about any notable accomplishments or controversies during his tenure in the House of Representatives. Therefore, while some insight can be gleaned from the given biography, a much fuller picture of his life and work would require more comprehensive information."},{"instruction":"Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Fluorescence near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) utilizing an integrated QD-LED has been demonstrated.\\"? Answer:","output":"Based on the passage, one potential question to test the students' comprehension could be: Question: Explain the similarities and differences between the structure of QD-LEDs and OLEDs, and discuss the benefits of QD-LEDs in quantum dot display and fluorescence imaging applications. Answer: The structure of QD-LEDs (Quantum Dot Light Emitting Diodes) is similar to the basic design of OLEDs (Organic Light Emitting Diodes) in that they both involve a layer of active material sandwiched between layers of electron-transporting and hole-transporting materials. In the case of QD-LEDs, a layer of quantum dots is used as the active material, whereas OLEDs use organic molecules as the active material. When an electric field is applied, electrons and holes move into the quantum dot layer in QD-LEDs and recombine to form an exciton that excites a QD (Quantum Dot). This mechanism of operation is common in research related to quantum dot displays. One advantage of QD-LEDs in this application is the tunability of emission wavelengths, which allows for precise control over the colors emitted, resulting in better display quality. Additionally, QD-LEDs offer a narrow bandwidth, which further contributes to their effectiveness in quantum dot displays. QD-LEDs are also advantageous as excitation sources for fluorescence imaging. The tunability of emission wavelengths and narrow bandwidth can be particularly beneficial for applications such as fluorescence near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). The passage specifically mentions the successful demonstration of an integrated QD-LED in a fluorescence NSOM setup, highlighting its potential in this field. Overall, this question aims to test students' understanding of the similarities and differences between QD-LED and OLED structures, as well as their ability to identify the benefits of the QD-LED technology in quantum dot display and fluorescence imaging applications."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: A text is given in English.

Free person: This option does not provide much information about the servant's status at the wedding. It only implies that they are not a slave or bound to someone. It doesn't necessarily mean they have a specific status or role at the wedding. 2. Celebrity: Celebrities are usually individuals who have a public following and are recognized in society for various reasons, like their talent, career achievements, or influence. It is unlikely that a celebrity would be asked to put flowers at a wedding, as they are generally guests or performers. 3. Boss: A boss would typically hold a supervisory or authoritative position and would likely delegate tasks like placing flowers to subordinates. The fact that the servant was asked where to put the flowers suggests they are not in an authoritative position at the wedding. 4. In charge: This option implies that the servant has some authority or responsibility at the wedding. However, being asked about where to put the flowers suggests they may not be the central person in charge or have overall responsibility for the entire event. 5. Rich person: Wealth does not necessarily have anything to do with the individual's status or role at a wedding.

Kennedy; and C) Richard Pryor and Marlon Brando made sweet, druggy love to each other back in the ‘70s. It was a great moment in internet culture, bringing together people of all walks of life to gossip about affairs that happened 40 years ago—which are the best kinds of affairs to gossip about, because everyone involved has already moved on (or is no longer with us, in the case of Brando and Pryor). Now, though, Jones has apologized for the “silly things” he said in his interviews with Vulture and GQ, saying that his six daughters had sat him down and basically told him he was too old and too distinguished of a public figure to be running his mouth like that. “Even at 85, it’s apparent that ‘word vomit’ and bad-mouthing is inexcusable,” he says, referring to all the shit he talked not only about The Beatles, but U2 (who he says used to be a good band) and Michael Jackson (who he called “Machiavellian”) as well. Jones doesn’t go so far as to walk back anything he said in those interviews, mind you, just says that he should have known better than to put all that on the record. As far as Brando and Pryor go, soon after the Vulture interview was published, Pryor’s widow Jennifer Lee Pryor told TMZ that hell yeah, they hooked up, and that Pryor would have found the whole thing hilarious. Pryor’s daughter Rain and Brando’s son Miko then came forward to dispute Jennifer Lee Pryor’s claim, a family disagreement that may have helped prompt Jones’ apology. [via Vulture] ||||| The 84-year-old record producer says he had a long talk with his daughters about what he said, and he is sorry. Quincy Jones on Thursday morning issued an apology for remarks he made in bombshell interviews with Vulture and GQ in late January. In his apology, the music legend said his daughters took him aside and talked to him about the effects of the comments. The 84-year-old record producer said he stopped drinking a few years back and his memory of past events is not as sharp as it should be, which is one of the side effects, so his stories do not paint the whole picture. \\"I am sorry to anyone whom my words offended, and I am especially sorry to my friends who are still here with me and those who aren't,\\" Jones said in the statement. One of the biggest tales Jones shared in one interview was that the late Richard Pryor allegedly had a sexual relationship with the late Marlon Brando. Pryor's ex-wife said it was true, but Brando's son denied the claim. Jones was also pretty hard on The Beatles in one interview, calling them \\"no-playing motherfuckers.\\" \\"Paul was the worst bass player I ever heard. And Ringo? Don't even talk about it,\\" he said. \\"I remember once we were in the studio with George Martin, and Ringo had taken three hours for a four-bar thing he was trying to fix on a song. He couldn't get it.\\" In the lengthy apology, Jones made it clear he already reached out to \\"many\\" of his friends who were mentioned in the interviews so he could tell them sorry, personally. \\"These friends are like blood family to me,\\" he said in the Thursday statement. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

In 1985, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates embarked on an ambitious expedition to climb the previously unattempted West Face of Siula Grande, standing at a daunting height of 20,814 feet (6,344 meters). The duo aimed to accomplish their climb using the Alpine style of mountaineering, which involves a small team with minimal equipment, in a continuous push to the summit without the use of fixed ropes or established camps. Despite encountering challenging weather and a series of technical difficulties, Simpson and Yates successfully reached the summit. However, disaster struck on their descent when Simpson slipped and fell, breaking his right leg and severely shattering his knee joint. With no hope of rescue and a dwindling supply of food, the two climbers were faced with an incredibly challenging and dangerous situation. In an attempt to lower his injured partner down the mountain, Yates accidentally lowered Simpson over an unseen cliff, leaving him dangling in mid-air. Unable to communicate and with no feasible way of reeling Simpson back up, Yates eventually had to make the agonizing decision to cut the rope, causing Simpson to drop into a deep crevasse within the glacier. Miraculously, Simpson survived the fall and managed to crawl his way out of the crevasse, despite his severe injuries. Over the course of three days, he painstakingly navigated the treacherous terrain, fueled by sheer determination and an unwavering will to survive. Eventually, he reached their base camp, where a shocked and exhausted Yates, who had already given him up for dead, found him. 'Touching the Void' is a powerful and gripping retelling of this extraordinary tale of survival against all odds. Directed by Kevin Macdonald and based on Joe Simpson's best-selling memoir of the same name published in 1988, the documentary drama employs a unique blend of interviews, re-enactments, and actual footage to recount the events of that fateful expedition. The harrowing story is a testament to the resilience and endurance of the human spirit, as well as a harrowing reminder of the risks and challenges that mountaineers face to push themselves to their limits and beyond."},{"instruction":"Context: It 's been a difficult Summer .

Is The Gram stain, developed in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram, characterises bacteria based on the structural characteristics of their cell walls. a good answer to this question?","output":"Step 1: Understand the given information and question The given information is about the Gram stain, developed in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram, and its ability to characterize bacteria based on structural characteristics of their cell walls. The question is asking if The Gram stain would show better test results on Nocardia bacteria. Step 2: Assess the information about the Gram stain The Gram stain is a widely used method in microbiology for differentiating bacterial species into two groups (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) based on the characteristics of their cell walls. While the Gram stain is useful for classification, it may not always provide specific information on the optimal stain for a particular bacterium. Step 3: Research Nocardia bacteria characteristics Nocardia is a genus of bacteria that are Gram-positive, aerobic, and filamentous. They are part of the Actinomycetales order, and some species are known to cause human diseases such as nocardiosis. Step 4: Determine if the Gram stain is suitable for Nocardia bacteria Since Nocardia bacteria have a Gram-positive cell wall structure, the Gram stain would generally be effective in distinguishing them from Gram-negative bacteria. However, the question asks which stain shows better test results on Nocardia bacteria, which implies a comparison to other staining methods. Step 5: Assess other staining methods for Nocardia bacteria One specific staining method for Nocardia is the modified Kinyoun acid-fast stain, which allows for better visualization and identification of these filamentous bacteria. Step 6: Provide the answer The Gram stain can provide some information on Nocardia bacteria, as they are Gram-positive. However, the modified Kinyoun acid-fast stain might show better test results specifically for Nocardia bacteria, as it is designed to visualize and identify filamentous bacteria like Nocardia more effectively. In conclusion, while the Gram stain can help differentiate Nocardia bacteria based on their cell wall structure, the modified Kinyoun acid-fast stain may provide better test results specifically for this genus."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Dust Brothers are Los Angeles, California-based, producers, E.Z. Mike (Michael Simpson) and King Gizmo (John King), famous for their sample-based music in the 1980s and 1990s, and specifically for their work on the albums \\"Paul's Boutique\\" by the Beastie Boys, \\"Odelay\\" by Beck, the soundtrack to the film \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"MMMBop\\" by Hanson. - DGC Records (an acronym for David Geffen Company) is an American record label that currently operates as a division of Interscope-Geffen-A&M, which is owned by Vivendi S.A.. - \`\` Debra '' is a song by Beck . He had originally attempted to record \`\` Debra '' with the Dust Brothers for Odelay , but he thought that it was too tongue - in - cheek . It was debuted main - stream in 1996 , and , as Beck noted , \`\` it became the centerpiece of the whole set . It was the song that people would react to more than the songs that they 'd heard on the radio . So we kept playing it and playing it . '' The song finally made it on to Midnite Vultures in 1999 . The song maintains a cult following . The song was covered by German industrial artist Kompressor . Kompressor 's version is called \`\` Kompressor Want To Get With You . '' - \\"MMMBop\\" is a song written and performed by the American pop rock band Hanson from their 1997 album \\"Middle of Nowhere\\". The song was nominated for two Grammys at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards in February 1998, and is the band's most successful single to date. \\"MMMBop\\" was phenomenally successful, especially for a debut single, reaching number one in 27 countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Mexico. In the United Kingdom, the song sold 710,000 copies and stayed at number one for 3 weeks. - Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell; July 8, 1970), known mononymously as Beck, is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer and multi-instrumentalist. He is mostly known for his musical composition, as well as a palette of sonic genres. - Midnite Vultures is the fourth official studio album and seventh overall by American alternative rock artist Beck, released in November 1999 by DGC Records. While similar to most of Beck's previous albums in its exploration of widely varying musical styles, \\"Midnite Vultures\\" didn't achieve the same blockbuster success as his breakthrough, \\"Odelay\\", though it was still critically and commercially well received. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A soundtrack, also written sound track, can be recorded music accompanying and synchronized to the images of a motion picture, book, television program or video game; a commercially released soundtrack album of music as featured in the soundtrack of a film or TV show; or the physical area of a film that contains the synchronized recorded sound. - Paul's Boutique is the second studio album by the American hip hop group Beastie Boys, released on July 25, 1989, on Capitol Records. Featuring production by the Dust Brothers, the album was recorded in Matt Dike's apartment and the Record Plant in Los Angeles from 1988 to 1989, and mixed at the Record Plant. Subsequent remixes were done at the Manhattan-based Record Plant Studios. The album is noted for being almost completely composed of samples, excluding the group's vocal output. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - The Beastie Boys were an American hip hop group from New York City, formed in 1980. For the majority of their career, the group consisted of Michael \\"Mike D\\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar). - Odelay is the second official studio album and fifth overall by American alternative rock artist Beck, originally released on June 18, 1996, by DGC Records. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).

Verb: \\"Drive\\" is a verb in the simple present tense. However, the verb \\"drive\\" typically implies active movement, requiring an agent capable of controlling the movement or action. In this case, \\"packages\\" aren't agents that can perform the action of driving. 4. Adjective: \\"Easily\\" is an adverb modifying the verb \\"drive.\\" It describes how the subject drives and is grammatically appropriate.

Capital letters are primarily used in English grammar in three instances: at the beginning of a sentence, for proper nouns, and for acronyms or initialisms. In the given text, \\"Counted in a census in Salby, Mesinge, Denmark\\", we have the first letter of the first word capitalized as it's the start of the sentence, and then the proper nouns - Salby, Mesinge, and Denmark, which are names of places, are also capitalized, according to the rules of English grammar. Reducing them to lowercase provides \\"counted in a census in salby, mesinge, denmark.\\" In this transformation, every upper case letter is converted into its equivalent lower case letter. It's important to note that non-alphabetic characters are not affected by this process. This form is often used when maintaining the uniformity of text, typically in programming, data entry, and sometimes in writing, when the aim is to eschew capitalizations for stylistic purposes.

A: yes","output":"The user probably asked, \\"Does a woman and a child need to be inside a restaurant in order to be seated at a restaurant table?\\" They stated that a woman and a child should be inside a restaurant for them to get seated at a restaurant table. To answer this question, let's consider the following: 1. Restaurants typically have a seating policy that requires customers to be present in order to be seated. This helps manage the flow of customers and ensures tables are used efficiently. 2. A woman and a child are considered as customers, so they would need to be inside the restaurant to be seated. 3. Some restaurants may have specific sections or seating arrangements for families with children to accommodate their needs better. Being inside the restaurant would allow the staff to direct the woman and child to the appropriate seating. 4. Depending on the restaurant's reservation policy, some establishments may allow customers to reserve a table in advance. In this case, the woman and child would still need to be present inside the restaurant at the time of their reservation to be seated. Considering these points, I would agree with the answer \\"yes.\\" A woman and a child should be inside a restaurant for them to get seated at a restaurant table as per standard restaurant seating policies and for the staff to accommodate any special seating arrangements they may require."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What key details about mohamed moumou can be extracted from the following bio?

Sentence 2: SCUBA divers and mermaids can also be seen from the boat. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Entailment occurs when the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another sentence. In this case, the first sentence talks about coastal cruises and a glass-bottomed boat trip to view colorful fish and marine plant life. The information provided in the first sentence is about the type of boat trips that allow passengers to see marine life through the bottom of the boat. However, the second sentence introduces new and unrelated information – talking about SCUBA divers and mermaids being seen from the boat. While it is possible that the glass-bottomed boat trip may provide a view of SCUBA divers if they happen to be in the area, the mention of mermaids, which are mythical creatures, is not guaranteed by the information provided in the first sentence. To summarize, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence as the presence of SCUBA divers and mermaids are not explicitly mentioned or guaranteed in the first sentence. Their appearance during a coastal cruise or glass-bottomed boat trip is incidental and not a direct consequence of the information provided in the first sentence."},{"instruction":"Question: She was taken aback by his real personality, what were other past boyfriends like to her?

However, his hold on Lan Na and Tenasserim coast was still nominal. The Siamese who originally were concerned about the rising power of Restored Hanthawaddy now actively supported the ethnic Mon rebels operating in the upper Tenasserim coast. In December 1759, Alaungpaya and his 40,000-strong armies invaded the Tenasserim coast. They crossed over the Tenasserim Hills, and finally reached Ayutthaya on 11 April 1760. But only five days into the siege, the Burmese king suddenly fell ill and the Burmese withdrew. The king died three weeks later, ending the war. The 1760 war was inconclusive. Although Burma had regained the upper Tenasserim coast to Tavoy, they still had to deal with Siamese supported rebellions in Lan Na and at Tavoy . The warfare resumed in August 1765, when two Burmese armies invaded again in a pincer movement on the Siamese capital. The Burmese armies took Ayutthaya in April 1767 after a 14-months' siege. The Burmese armies sacked the city and committed atrocities that mar the Burmese-Thai relations to the present.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Final Cut Movie plot: The serial opens with Prime Minister Francis Urquhart shooting his gun dog, now too old to perform its duties â a scene which establishes the theme of the ending of a career. Shortly afterwards, Urquhart attends the fictional state funeral of Margaret Thatcher. He publicly praises Thatcher as his mentor, but privately begrudges her record as the longest-serving prime minister in recent history,[note 1] a record that Urquhart himself is soon to surpass. To \\"leave my mark on the world,\\" Urquhart champions a treaty resolving the Cyprus dispute while secretly working to bring offshore oil deposits under the control of the Turkish authorities on the island so that a Turkish-British consortium will have the drilling rights; an executive of the consortium has promised to provide for Urquhart's retirement fund in return. Urquhart also has a personal connection to Cyprus: as a nineteen-year-old British Army lieutenant serving there in 1956, he killed two young EOKA guerrillas while trying to get information from them. Urquhart has frequent nightmares and flashbacks of this event, and also of the murders of Mattie Storin and others, shown in the previous series. On a motorway near London, Urquhart's car is rammed by another car containing three drunken louts. The attackers are quickly killed by his security staff. Urquhart sustains minor head injuries in the collision, but his life is not endangered. When Elizabeth arrives at hospital, he is delirious and confuses the incident on the motorway with the incident in Cyprus. Tom Makepeace, Urquhart's Foreign Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister, chairs a cabinet meeting while Urquhart is in hospital; Urquhart considers Makepeace â the actual negotiator of the Cyprus treaty â as a potential challenger, although he doesn't take the threat very seriously, considering him \\"not a fighter\\" but \\"a sentimental dreamer\\".

The \\"averages\\" list now contains the averages of each two consecutive values, which is your answer. For example, with the given list [-100, 49, -40, -41, 62, 58, 41], let's calculate the averages of each two consecutive values: 1. (-100 + 49) / 2 = -25.5 2. (49 + (-40)) / 2 = 4.5 3. (-40 + (-41)) / 2 = -40.5 4. (-41 + 62) / 2 = 10.5 5. (62 + 58) / 2 = 60.0 6.

This means that even though these items are smaller and less obvious than the main products, they hold considerable value in their own right. Similarly, for college students, odds and ends can refer to odd moments or fragments of time, which when utilized well, can contribute to their overall success. Great people in science, art, and other fields have managed to achieve significant accomplishments by making the best use of their odd moments. Thomas A. Edison serves as a good example of this, as he constantly utilized his odd moments for thinking, planning, and working on his inventions. This diligent use of his time allowed him to create inventions known worldwide and provided valuable resources for humanity. Recognizing that busy people always find time for everything while people with great spare time find time for nothing emphasizes the need to make the best use of one's time, particularly those odd moments.

This decision did not come easily. After months of negotiations, the United Nations and key international players, including the United States and Russia, managed to broker a deal. The agreement outlined the formation of a transitional government that included members from various factions within the Syrian society, including opposition groups, civil society representatives, and members of the current government. The international community was cautiously optimistic about the agreement, viewing it as a vital step toward stabilizing the war-torn country. The formation of the transitional government could pave the way for much-needed humanitarian assistance, as well as political and economic reforms that could help bring an end to Syria's years-long civil war. However, challenges still lie ahead. As part of the agreement, Assad is granted asylum in Russia, with the understanding that he will not participate in any political activity related to Syria. His departure from power is met with mixed reactions in the country; some celebrate the fall of the Assad regime, while others fear that his absence will only further destabilize the nation. Meanwhile, the transitional government faces the unenviable task of working to establish national unity and begin the process of rebuilding Syria. Initially, the transitional government is able to achieve some significant milestones, including the establishment of a new constitution, the organization of free and fair elections, and the implementation of programs to encourage the safe return of millions of displaced Syrians. However, the road to full stability is not an easy one, as the transitional government encounters numerous obstacles along the way. Old enmities between various factions persist, and it becomes challenging to maintain the fragile balance of power. Additionally, remnants of the Assad regime and extremist groups such as ISIS continue to launch attacks to destabilize the situation, creating security challenges for the new government. While the international community maintains its support for the transitional government, they also acknowledge that the success of the new political arrangement ultimately relies on the willingness and ability of the Syrian people to set aside their differences and work toward a better future for their country. The ongoing humanitarian crisis, coupled with the additional challenges of rebuilding infrastructure and creating economic opportunities, will require the cooperative efforts and dedication of all Syrians.

To achieve these characteristics, approximately 11% or more of chromium is added to the steel. Chromium is the key element that provides stainless steel with its unique attributes and makes it more resistant to the effects of water, air, and chemicals than ordinary steel. But what is it about chromium that makes stainless steel so effective at combating corrosion, rusting, and staining? Let's discuss this in detail. When chromium is added to steel, it reacts with oxygen in the air to form a thin, invisible, and adherent layer of chromium oxide over the surface of the steel. This passive film is responsible for protecting stainless steel from external elements that might cause corrosion or rusting. The oxide layer is only a few atoms thick and acts as a barrier, hindering further reaction between the steel and its environment. The chromium oxide film is self-healing, which means that if the stainless steel surface is scratched or damaged, new chromium atoms will come into contact with the oxygen, reforming the protective oxide layer and continuing to provide corrosion resistance. This self-healing ability is an essential aspect of the durability and longevity of stainless steel. There are also other alloying elements sometimes added in smaller amounts to enhance the properties of stainless steel: 1. Nickel: Improves corrosion resistance and provides better toughness, formability, and ductility. It also stabilizes the passive oxide film and extends its resistance to more aggressive environments. 2. Molybdenum: Increases resistance to pitting corrosion and crevice corrosion, which are localized corrosive attacks that can occur in chloride-rich environments, such as seawater. 3. Titanium and niobium: These elements are often added to form stable carbides and prevent the formation of chromium carbides, which can lead to intergranular corrosion. By stabilizing the carbides, these elements maintain the corrosion resistance of stainless steel. 4. Copper: Enhances corrosion resistance, particularly against sulfuric and phosphoric acids, and imparts antibacterial properties to the alloy. 5. Nitrogen: Improves strength and corrosion resistance, and it is particularly beneficial in stabilizing austenitic stainless steels. To summarize, adding approximately 11% or more of chromium to steel is what creates stainless steel and imparts properties that prevent it from corroding, rusting, or staining when exposed to water. The chromium reacts with oxygen to form a self-healing, passive chromium oxide film on the surface of the material, providing an effective barrier against corrosive agents. Other alloying elements may be added to further enhance stainless steel's properties, making it a versatile and popular material for various applications."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, a passage will be given and the goal is to identify an event from the passage.

The film begins with an elderly nurse in Stephens Sanitorium making her rounds. After a troubling incident in which a patient threatens her life, she decides to retire, and goes out to visit the chief doctor, Dr. Stephens, to inform him of the decision. Unfortunately, in the process of therapy (which involves chopping wood with an axe), the crazed former magistrate known as Judge (Gene Ross) accidentally lands the axe in Dr. Stephens' back, apparently killing him. The shaken nurse returns inside to finish packing, where she is attacked by Harriet (Camilla Carr), a patient who accuses her of stealing her \\"baby\\" (actually a plastic doll). The patient kills her by crushing her head in the nurse's suitcase. The only remaining doctor appears to be Dr. Geraldine Masters (Anne MacAdams), who is greeted by Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik), a pretty young nurse who informs Dr. Masters that Dr. Stephens had hired her a week ago. Dr. Masters begrudgingly allows her to settle in. The young nurse meets the patients, including a lobotomized and childish man named Sam (Bill McGhee) who enjoys popsicles and his plastic toy boat, a nymphomaniac and schizophrenic named Allyson (Betty Chandler), an emotionally dependent woman named Jennifer (Harryette Warren), an octogenarian woman named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) who spouts bizarre poetry and mistakes flowers in the garden to be her own children, a juvenile prankster named Danny (Jessie Kirby), a shellshocked Sergeant (Hugh Feagin) who lost his mind after accidentally killing his men in Vietnam, and the crazed judge who seems incapable of speaking in anything other than courtroom jargon and the repeated phrase \\"My name... is...

A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine). Fiction centered on such characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s, is known as superhero fiction. - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \\"regnal\\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \\"name\\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously. For example, the same person was both King James I of England (along with Ireland) and King James VI of Scotland. - The ODESSA network (from the German: \\"Organisation der Ehemaligen SS-Angehörigen\\", meaning: Organization of Former SS Members) was a purported international Nazi underground organization set up towards the end of World War II by a group of SS officers with the aim of facilitating secret escape routes later known as ratlines allegedly to allow the SS members to avoid capture and prosecution for war crimes and to escape to Argentina, Brazil, or the Middle East under false names. - Sigmund Freud ( born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856 23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. Freud lived and worked in Vienna, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938 Freud left Austria to escape the Nazis. He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939. - Oneirology (from Greek \\"\\", \\"oneiron\\", \\"dream\\"; and -\\"\\", -\\"logia\\", \\"the study of\\") is the scientific study of dreams. Current research seeks correlations between dreaming and current knowledge about the functions of the brain, as well as understanding of how the brain works during dreaming as pertains to memory formation and mental disorders. The study of oneirology can be distinguished from dream interpretation in that the aim is to quantitatively study the process of dreams instead of analyzing the meaning behind them. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Psychoanalysis is a set of theories and therapeutic techniques related to the study of the unconscious mind, which together form a method of treatment for mental-health disorders. The discipline was established in the early 1890s by Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud and stemmed partly from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others. - Sergei Konstantinovitch Pankejeff ( Russian : ; December 24 , 1886 -- May 7 , 1979 ) was a Russian aristocrat from Odessa best known for being a patient of Sigmund Freud , who gave him the pseudonym of Wolf Man ( der Wolfsmann ) to protect his identity , after a dream Pankejeff had of a tree full of white wolves . - A monarch is the sovereign head of state in a monarchy. A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the state, or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Typically a monarch either personally inherits the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as \\"the throne\\" or \\"the crown\\") or is selected by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, acclamation or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns for life or until abdication. - IMAGE (from Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), or Explorer 78, was a NASA MIDEX mission that studied the global response of the Earth's magnetosphere to changes in the solar wind. It was launched March 25, 2000 by a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg AFB and ceased operations in December 2005. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - A dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. The content and purpose of dreams are not fully understood, though they have been a topic of scientific speculation, as well as a subject of philosophical and religious interest, throughout recorded history. The scientific study of dreams is called oneirology. - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge. - The University of Vienna is a public university located in Vienna, Austria. It was founded by Duke Rudolph IV in 1365 and is one of the oldest universities in the German-speaking world. With its long and rich history, the University of Vienna has developed into one of the biggest universities in Europe, and also one of the most renowned, especially in the Humanities. It is associated with 15 Nobel prize winners and has been the academic home of a large number of figures both of historical and academic importance. - A ring name is a stage name used by a professional wrestler, martial artist, or a boxer. While some ring names may have a fictitious first name and surname, others may simply be a nickname from the moves that they do or their talents in the ring. - Docent is a title at some European universities to denote a specific academic appointment within a set structure of academic ranks below the full professor rank. - A name is a term used for identification. Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a \\"specific\\" individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes called \\"common names\\" or (obsolete) \\"general names\\". A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name. - Habilitation is a post-doctoral qualification or academic degree at some European and Central Asian, North African, and Latin American universities. It is conferred for a habilitation thesis based on independent scholarship, which was reviewed by and successfully defended before an academic committee in a process similar to that of a doctoral dissertation. In some countries, a habilitation degree is a required formal qualification to independently teach and examine a designated subject at the university level. - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Veins return deoxygenated blood to the heart, while arteries transport oxygen-rich blood from the heart to other organs and tissues. This flow in veins and arteries is unidirectional and not particularly \\"up and down\\" in the manner that an electrical current might be intended. In contrast, the flow of current in an electrical circuit refers to the motion of charged particles - either electrons or (less commonly) ions - through a conducting medium.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When we think about the human body, we know that it is composed of approximately 60% water, which plays many essential roles in maintaining proper bodily functions. Water is crucial for digesting food, regulating body temperature, removing waste, and facilitating numerous chemical reactions. Additionally, every cell, tissue, and organ in our body needs water to work properly. Without water, a person would experience dehydration, potentially leading to life-threatening complications.

For most of the film he observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other charactersâranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friendsâabout such issues as metaphysics, free will, social philosophy, and the meaning of life. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence, but rather, focus on a random isolated person, group of people, or couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film touches also upon existentialism, situationist politics, posthumanity, the film theory of AndrÃ© Bazin, and lucid dreaming, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name. Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream. The protagonist's final talk is with a character who looks somewhat similar to the protagonist himself and whom he briefly encountered previously, earlier in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's understanding that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only to...

Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.

He takes two lengths of copper wire and coils them. His first coil, A, has a weaker magnetic field than his second coil, B. Which coil has a stronger electromagnetic field, A or B? Hint: The device in the circuit in Figure above is an ammeter. It measures the current that flows through the wire. The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced. If more turns were added to the coil, this would increase the strength of the magnetic field as well. If the magnet were moved back and forth repeatedly, the current would keep changing direction. In other words, alternating current would be produced. This is illustrated in Figure below .","output":"Based on the provided information, coil B has a stronger electromagnetic field than coil A. Here's the step-by-step reasoning behind it: 1.

It may seem hard to believe, but when electricity is made, so are greenhouse gases . This means that every time you use electricity you help make global warming worse! Cars are also making global warming worse. They burn fossil fuels in their engines, and send lots of greenhouse gases into the air. Global warming may be a big problem, but we can all help stop it. People can try to drive their cars less. Or even get ones that run on sunlight! You can also help. Let's try one of these top ideas: (1) Try to use less electricity. Turn off lights, your television, and your computer when you've stopped using them. To make electricity, fossil fuels are burned in big factories. But burning fossil fuels also makes greenhouse gases. You should also try to watch less TV. (2) Plant trees. Not only is it a fun thing to do, but it is also a great way to lower the number of greenhouse gases in the air. Trees take carbon dioxide out of the air when they grow. (3) Don't throw away your rubbish, try to recycle it. If rubbish is not recycled, it is put in the ground. There it rots and makes a greenhouse gas called methane .So try to recycle cans, bottles, plastic bags and newspapers. It'll make you feel great! And it'll help the Earth.

One evening, after getting drunk at a bar, Mitch and Dave urinate in a park's fountain, and simultaneously wish that they had each other's lives. The next morning, Mitch and Dave realize they have switched bodies. Mitch remembers the wish they made the night before and they drive back to the park, planning to urinate again in the fountain and wish for their original lives back, but find the fountain has been removed for restorations. Forced to wait a few days until the parks department can locate the fountain, Mitch and Dave agree to pretend to be each other for the day. When Mitch arrives at Dave's law firm office, he befriends Dave's attractive assistant, Sabrina McKay. However, Mitch's lack of professionalism and legal knowledge cause a big merger to fall through. Meanwhile, Dave arrives at Mitch's film shoot to discover that it is a lorno (light porno). Tired of pretending to be Mitch, Dave has them go back to his house to tell his wife Jamie the truth, but Jamie does not believe him. Dave gives Mitch advice on how to behave professionally and Mitch sets Dave up on a date with Sabrina, who Mitch has had a crush on. After speaking with his father, Mitch rededicates himself to doing everything Dave's life demands, from taking care of the kids and buying groceries to making decisions at the firm. On the night of her ballet recital, Cara, Dave's eldest child, is about to be pushed by another girl who has a habit of bullying her, but takes Mitch's advice and throws her to the floor, to which Mitch foul-mouthedly cheers. Cara tells Mitch that she loves him and Mitch says the same thing, but feels guilty for doing so immediately after. That night, Mitch and Jamie begin to have sex with each other, but Mitch angrily finds that his guilt will not allow him to become erect, and he admits that he is not cut out for the responsibilities of an adult. Jamie comforts him, and he discreetly rests his head on her breasts. The answer is:","output":"The assistant, Sabrina McKay, is going on a date with Dave. However, it should be noted that Dave's body has been switched with Mitch, so technically, Sabrina is going on a date with Mitch who is in Dave's body. This date was set up by Mitch as he has had a crush on Sabrina."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are given a conversation between two people.

George Banks returns home to learn from his wife, Winifred, that Katie Nanna has left their service after Jane and Michael ran away again. They are returned shortly after by Constable Jones, who reveals the children were chasing a lost kite. The children ask their father to help build a better kite, but he dismisses them.

They do have the first big upset of the NCAA tournament and hope they can give their university something to rally around. William Lee scored the last four points for 14th-seeded UAB, and the Blazers knocked off third-seeded Iowa State 60-59 on Thursday in their opening game in the NCAA tournament. It's the third straight year a 14 seed has upset a No. 3 seed, and Georgia State followed up by joining the list within an hour with a 57-56 win over Baylor. The Blazers (20-15) came in with the third-youngest team in the NCAA tournament and with nobody having played in this tournament before. They wound up winning the program's first NCAA game since 2005 and ran over to celebrate in front of the fans of a school that shut its football program down in December. \\"For us, it was just huge,\\" UAB junior Robert Brown said. \\"We come here, not just to play games, but to actually make some noise and to win some games. To be able to do that and win for Birmingham, win for Coach (Jerod) Haase, it's a great feeling.\\" And it set off a wild celebration in the Blazers' locker room. \\"We were celebrating because that was a really big win for us with us being the underdogs,\\" UAB guard Tyler Madison said. Haase estimated maybe four or five of the Blazers didn't even realize a month ago that the Conference USA tournament champion earned an automatic berth, while another had never watched a selection show before Sunday. \\"You're a product of your thoughts,\\" Haase said. \\"There's been more talk right now about 14 seed or upsets than we've said the entire year. Our thoughts have been, when we play well, we think we can compete with anybody, and those thoughts have been expressed to our team, and our team has made the choice to believe in that. I think that's what you saw today.\\" The ninth-ranked Cyclones (25-9) came into the South Regional looking for a much longer run than a year ago when they reached the Sweet 16 without top scorer Georges Niang due to injury. But they just couldn't match the scrappy Blazers on the boards in a second half where the Cyclones couldn't hold onto a 55-51 lead with 3:13 left. For Iowa State coach Fred Hoiberg, it's as tough a loss as he's had. His Cyclones came in having won five straight, rallying from double-digit deficits in each on their way to the Big 12 tournament title. Hoiberg called that an emotional three days in Kansas City followed by playing the first game Thursday. \\"I'm not going to make any excuses,\\" Hoiberg said. \\"You've got to come out and play 40 minutes. ... I don't know. Maybe we should have let them get up double digits. That's kind of how we play our best.\\" The Blazers, who outscored Iowa State 9-4 down the stretch, will play 11th-seeded UCLA, a 60-59 winner over sixth-seeded SMU, on Saturday. Iowa State, which lost its opener as a No. 2 seed in 2001, last led at 57-56 on a basket by Monte Morris. But Lee hit a jumper with 24 seconds left putting UAB ahead to stay. Niang had a jumper blocked by Tosin Mehinti, and Lee got the rebound. Lee hit two free throws with 12.1 seconds left for the Blazers' final points. Naz Long missed a 3 that Morris tipped in with 0.4 seconds left, and the Cyclones couldn't get the ball back before the Blazers started celebrating their gutty win. \\"We got lackadaisical,\\" Long said. \\"We have no one to blame but ourselves. This one burns, man. It burns.\\" Brown led UAB with 21 points, Lee finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds. Madison also had 11 rebounds as the Blazers dominated the boards 52-37. Morris finished with 15 points for the Cyclones, who were making a school-record fourth straight tournament appearance only to lose their opener for the first time since 2001. Niang and reserve Matt Thomas both added 11 points, and Jameel McKay had 10 points and 12 rebounds. Iowa State looked ready to finally put away an opponent as the Cyclones opened the game with a 12-2 lead. The Blazers settled down quickly enough and used a 14-4 run to turn it into a game taking advantage of repeated turnovers by the Cyclones. The Blazers took a 31-28 halftime lead before a 6:52 scoring drought. Not that it hurt as the teams wound up swapping the lead a total of 17 times with eight ties. STREAK CONTINUED: UAB's win as a No. 14 seed follows up what Mercer did to Duke last year in the tournament. In 2013, it was Harvard upsetting New Mexico. So now Iowa State joins the list. Notre Dame coach Mike Brey, whose team was also a 3 seed, saw UAB's upset and said of Iowa State: \\"They took the bullet, not us.\\" UAB: Blazers' fans didn't miss an opportunity to chant \\"Fire Ray Watts\\" during timeouts in their protest against the university president who shut down the school's football program in December. ... The Blazers had a 19-9 edge on the offensive glass. ... Haase won his debut as a head coach, though he appeared in 17 other tournaments as a player or assistant. Iowa State: Thomas hadn't scored in double figures since late February, a span of six straight games. ... The Cyclones, who came in with the third-most wins in school history, lost as a No. 2 seed to 15th-seeded Hampton in 2001. ...

UAB's victory was particularly meaningful for the team and its fans due to the controversial decision to shut down the school's football program in December 2014.

First and foremost, the cost difference between the wig and the haircut played a significant role in this decision. Adam found a high-quality, stylish wig at a discounted price, making it an attractive and affordable option. On the other hand, the haircut he was interested in required the expertise of a skilled hairstylist, which would have been significantly more expensive. By opting for the wig, Adam was able to save a considerable amount of money that he could utilize in other aspects of his life or personal grooming. Secondly, the wig allowed Adam the flexibility to switch up his look with ease and without too much commitment. With a haircut, he would have been limited to one particular style for several weeks or even months until his hair grew back. The wig, however, provided him with the option to alternate his appearance whenever he wanted, offering more versatility and ensuring that he would never grow bored with his style. Additionally, if Adam were to attend a special event or have an important meeting where he wanted to present a more polished appearance, he could easily do so by simply switching to a different wig. Moreover, wigs generally require less maintenance than natural hair. With a wig, Adam wouldn't have to worry about regular visits to the hairstylist to maintain the shape and style or investing in expensive hair care products. This would save him not only money but also valuable time – something that many people often overlook when making such decisions. Furthermore, choosing a wig also meant that Adam could avoid potential damage to his natural hair that could be caused by frequent salon visits, chemical treatments, and styling tools. Hair damage is a common concern for many individuals, and investing in a wig provided him with a worry-free solution, reducing the risk of potential hair issues such as breakage and split ends. In conclusion, Adam's choice to purchase a wig instead of receiving a haircut was driven by the numerous benefits offered by this alternative option. The wig was not only cheaper but also granted him the freedom to experiment with different looks, lower maintenance requirements, and the added advantage of minimizing damage to his natural hair. Considering all these factors, Adam's decision to go with the wig rather than the more expensive haircut proved to be a smarter, more practical choice."},{"instruction":"Love in Nepal is a 2004 Indian Hindi romantic thriller film directed by Rajat Mukherjee which was released on 6 March 2004.

Can you generate a short summary of the above paragraph?","output":"An Arab Israeli community activist was indicted on espionage charges on Thursday, accused of providing Hezbollah, a Shiite militant group in Lebanon, with information about the locations of Israeli defense facilities. This situation has underscored the ongoing tension and conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, as well as the broader conflicts in the region. Espionage accusations, such as this one, are grave and involve potential risks to national security. In the context of Israel, surrounded by nations with which it has historically tense relationships, charges of espionage contribute to the tension and underlines the complexities of regional politics. Any leakage of sensitive information about defense facilities possibly paves the way for sabotage or attacks, heightening the overall security risk. The identity of the accused as an Arab Israeli adds another layer of complexity to the dialogue around the issue. The Arab Israeli population has been living at the crossroads of identity and loyalty, facing dual pressure from both their native Arab countries and their citizenship country, Israel. This case, which involves allegations of an Arab Israeli aiding a Lebanese militant group, might spark discourse on the topic of loyalty and levels of integration of Arab Israelis into Israeli society. Furthermore, the implicated group, Hezbollah, is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the US, and other countries. Its main goal is to annihilate Israel, advocating for an armed struggle against it. Therefore, any connection or assistance provided to Hezbollah is viewed extremely seriously by Israeli authorities. In case of proven guilt, the activist could face severe punishments. Overall, charging an Arab Israeli activist with espionage, accusing him of aiding a hostile entity like Hezbollah, has potential implications that stretch beyond the immediate issue of national security. It plays into existing tensions between Israel and Lebanon, the position of Arab Israelis within Israel, and the broader Israel-Arab conflicts. There is a likelihood that this incident may trigger discussions around these topics while also having the potential to disturb the fragile balance in local and regional politics."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - Georgette Heyer (16 August 1902 4 July 1974) was an English historical romance and detective fiction novelist.

Fact 2: During the flowering cycle they receive fewer hours of light. Given the two facts above, plants detect and respond to the what such as during the flowering when hours are fewer? A:","output":"Given the two facts mentioned, plants detect and respond to changes in the light cycle, specifically the photoperiod (the duration of light exposure within a 24-hour period). During the flowering stage, plants receive fewer hours of light, which often serves as a signal for them to begin producing flowers. This transition is a result of their ability to sense and adapt to varying light conditions in their environments. The phenomenon of plants responding to the photoperiod is called photoperiodism. In some plant species, flowering is triggered by shortening day length (short-day plants), while in others, it is initiated by increasing day length (long-day plants). Furthermore, there are day-neutral plants that do not rely on day length to induce flowering. Various photoreceptor proteins present in plants, such as phytochromes and cryptochromes, are involved in detecting light and darkness, allowing them to adjust their growth and development accordingly."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you are given a sentence.

However, for every successful reality show, there are numerous others that never quite made it on TV, with some of them even crossing the boundary of bad taste. One such example, 'The Bachelor' for porn stars, promises thrills and escapades from the world of adult entertainment, but the concept was too risqué for network television. In this article, we will take a closer look at this controversial idea and other reality show concepts that never found a secure spot on the small screen. 'The Bachelor' for Porn Stars The proposed \\"adult\\" version of the popular dating show, 'The Bachelor,' would have seen porn stars vying for the affections of a single, eligible bachelor. Contestants would engage in various challenges designed to showcase their charm, wit, and sexual prowess. While there might have been a market for this provocative reality show, it may have led to protests and censorship based on its adult content, which would have harmed the ratings and advertising revenues of traditional broadcasters. Thus, this titillating concept never saw the light of day. Other Reality Shows That Failed to Make It on TV 1. 'Celebrity Boxing' In the early 2000s, FOX attempted to cash in on the popularity of celebrity-based reality shows by pitting D-list stars against one another in boxing matches. Every episode would be filled with rival celebrities putting on the gloves and going head-to-head in a boxing ring. While a few episodes were aired, it was a unanimous flop with both critics and audiences. 2. 'Who's Your Daddy?' Controversial from the get-go, this reality show had a controversial premise: an adopted adult would choose from a group of men whom they believed was their biological father. If the adult guessed correctly, they would win a cash prize. But if the contestant was wrong, the faux father would walk away with the money. FOX received significant backlash after airing the pilot episode in 2005, critics labeling the show tasteless and exploitative. The network quickly canceled the show. 3. 'The Will' This show took advantage of family tensions in the most distressing way, with family members battling one another in various challenges to win a share of a deceased relative's inheritance. The concept was not well received, and CBS axed the show after only one episode. 4. 'All My Babies' Mamas' Oxygen Network’s proposed reality series 'All My Babies' Mamas' featured rapper Shawty Lo, his 11 children, and their ten mothers, exploring the unique world the rapper had created for his family. Critics saw the show as perpetuating stereotypes and glorifying irresponsibility, and the network decided to scrap the project before any episodes were broadcast. 5. 'Bridalplasty' E! Network's reality show 'Bridalplasty' had brides-to-be competing for plastic surgery and a dream wedding based on their narcissistic desires. It was met with public outrage, with viewers questioning the show's morality and insensitivity towards the institution of marriage. The show was canceled after only one season. Conclusion Although reality television thrives on capturing the most intriguing and unpredictable human elements, it is crucial for creators and networks to respect certain boundaries that exist for a good reason. As the failures of shows like 'The Bachelor' for porn stars and others on this list demonstrate, pushing the envelope too far can infringe upon moral sensibilities and generate controversy, rather than capture an audience's interest. Moving forward, reality show creators must strike a delicate balance between creating unique, engaging television programs while maintaining a sense of responsibility for the impact they have on society."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Everybody cheats. Whether it's the taxi driver who tricks a visitor and takes them the long way round, or the shop assistant who doesn't give the correct change, or the police officer who accepts a bribe - everybody's at it. Cheats in the nest include the scientist whose research was based on fake data, the game show competitors who worked with a friend in the audience or win a million pounds, and the doctor who made up his qualifications and wasn't really a doctor at all. Everybody cheats; nobody's playing the game. Is cheating acceptable, a natural way of surviving and being successful? Or is it something that should _ , and young people discouraged from doing? If it's the latter how can we explain to children why so many bend the rules? Take sport for example. The Word Cup was filled with cheating. Whether diving, pretending to be hurt or denying a handball, footballers will do anything for a free - kick or a penalty shot. France striker Henry denied cheating to win the free - kick which led to his side's second goal in their 3 - 1 victory over Spain. Many footballers, however, are often putting it on. Whatever the nationality there's one common ploy: the player rolls over holding their leg, ankle or head seeming to be in great pain. As a result a yellow card and / or free - kick is given for the foul and then, a few seconds later, the player is up and about as if nothing had happened ! The ref may be taken in by it but youngsters watching the game aren't. they also see their heroes getting away with it. Of course it's not just football.

The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear. When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect. The next series of scenes deal with both Edward spinning a web of lies, and Lumpus trying to come to grips with Lazlo's disappearance, but only due to his fear of Commander Hoo-Ha, not over any concern for the missing scouts. answer the following question: How is Lumpus scared of after Lazlo goes missing? A:","output":"Lumpus is scared after Lazlo goes missing because he fears the reaction and potential consequences from Commander Hoo-Ha, who is in charge of the camp. Lumpus is not scared due to genuine concern for Lazlo's well-being, but rather due to the potential repercussions he may face from Commander Hoo-Ha for failing to maintain order and ensure the safety of the campers under his supervision."},{"instruction":"How so I ask questions on Quora?

They ask questions and make complaints about getting around a region plagued with some of the worst traffic in the nation. The doctor diagnoses problems and tries to bring relief. Dr. Gridlock appears in The Post's Metro section on Sunday and in the Extra section on Thursday. His comments also appear on the Web site's Get There blog. You can send e-mails for the newspaper column to drgridlock@washpost.com or write to Dr. Gridlock at 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071. Dr. Gridlock: Fellow voyagers, it's a pleasure to join you on what's shaping up as an interesting day in local transportation. I've just come from the Metro rail station at Reagan National Airport, where the transit authority was displaying some new rail car interiors. One was a test car that has some bench seating along the sides. Metro wants to put that on the rails today or tomorrow and see how you react to it. Metro also had an example of the new interior design that will be entering service within a month. It's the one in which floor to ceiling poles have been removed in favor of seat to ceiling poles. The idea is to move us into the car, away from the congestion around the doors that riders find so annoying. I'll put something up on our Get There blog later today, describing this some more. Maybe I can show you a picture, too. Also today, at about the time we wrap up this discussion at 2 p.m., a panel of experts commissioned by the state of Virginia will be releasing its recommendations on whether the new rail line through Tyson's Corner should be above or below ground. We can talk about those topics, or anything else in transit and traffic that's on your mind today. I can tell you some of the things I've been up to during my first week as the new Dr. Gridlock. Let's start off with some of the questions and comments that were waiting for me when I came in. Washington, D.C.: Why Dr. Gridlock? Did you write a dissertation? Get an honorary degree? Until you earn it, I think you should go by Mr. Gridlock. Dr. Gridlock: I'm in the process of certifying myself. I've been making the rounds, trying to learn about what hurts, so I can make proper diagnoses. For example, I circumnavigated the outer loop of the Capital Beltway. I'm closing in on another goal of riding the entire Metro system. Still have legs of the Red, Yellow and Blue lines to complete. Been exploring Braddock Road, Fairfax Parkway, Route 7, the Ride On bus, the DC Circulator -- I know it's Cole's Notes, not \\"Grey's Anatomy.\\" I know you expect the doc to know our corner of the world on a micro level. Rockville, Md.: Congratulations (I think) for becoming the next Dr. Gridlock! Just an observation, but it seems like summer commuting is a good indication of what rush hour traffic would be like if more people telecommuted. Just taking off the vacationers from the roads during the summer seems to make a tough commute tolerable. Dr. Gridlock: One thing I'm very aware of as I go out on test drives across the region is that I'm not seeing experiencing the agonies that so many of you have reported for so long. We've had a lot of people respond to our Get There posting by offering to let us accompany them on their commutes. I expect to be doing that. For most of the past seven years, I've had a luxurious commute: Red Line from Silver Spring to Farragut North. I used to drive downtown, but it dawned on me that I was paying ten bucks a day to warehouse my car. When I started taking the Red Line, I figured I was saving about 750 a year. Must have been a lot more by the time I stopped doing that regularly. You've got big shoes to fill, but I am sure you are going to do great. Any word on when the Springfield Interchange will finally be completed? There were MAJOR backups this weekend coming from Washington, D.C. going south. Dr. Gridlock: Thank you, I do indeed feel like I have big shoes to fill, and I'm trying to get smart in a hurry. I've been The Post's editor for local transportation issues for most of the past seven years, so I've got a broad understanding of the region's traffic and transit issues. Now, I'm trying to learn this at the level you folks expect. Springfield Interchange is still on schedule for completion in late 2007. Our other big project, the Wilson Bridge, also is on schedule. Second span is to be completed in 2008. But those two big projects have providing some of the big action this summer, as they progress. There's a lot of work going on at Springfield that has a high impact on travelers. Wilson Bridge opened the first new span over the past two months. That was a big disruption on two weekends as the lanes were shifted to the new span, but I thought it was managed very well. Silver Spring, Md.: What is your view of the Purple Line's chances of becoming a reality (in our lifetime)? Dr. Gridlock: When I was The Post's transportation editor, I used to ask the reporters to write a series called \\"Not In My Lifetime,\\" describing all the road and rail projects that we've been teased about over the years. Currently, I'm wondering if the Purple Line and Rail to Dulles will fall into this category. Both projects have serious financing issues. Both have issues about whether to tunnel. There are questions about whether the federal government will provide essential funding. These are issues on want to stay on top of in the newspaper column and online. Severn, Md.: Dr. Dr. Give me the news, I've got a bad case of gridlock blues. Wondering if there has been any further news on the Metro expansion to BWI and all those stops along the way? Dr. Gridlock: I just expressed my concerns about the Purple Line and Rail to Dulles. That goes triple for Metro to BWI. It's another project that would require gobs of federal money. How could Maryland suck up that much more money from the feds after the inter county connector and the Purple Line? Clifton, Va.: What type of vehicle do you drive?? Other car and trucks in the family. I really think Dr. Gridlock should have a Ducati 999 in Ferrari Red.! Dr. Gridlock: My editor, Steven Ginsberg, says I need to buy a hybrid -- that Dr. Gridlock needs to make a statement. Others say a hybrid, with a GPS, and satellite radio. I drive a 1997 Toyota RAV4 SUV. I get the hand-me-downs in our family. My wife, who commutes from our inside the Beltway home in Montgomery County home to Baltimore, gets first crack at vehicles. When she builds up high mileage, she passes them down to me. Wheaton, Md.: I figure that the high heat that is predicted for the next few days will require the trains to slow down, due to the tracks' tendency to expand with heat. Dr. Gridlock: I see the heat advisories from VRE and MARC, when the temperature causes the freight lines that own some of the region's track to issue go-slow orders to the commuter lines. Seems like there have been an awful lot of them this summer. It must be hard to operate a commuter service when riders can't count on a schedule. I understand the safety issue involved: That high heat can kink rails and create dangerous situations. By the way, I'm an admirer of Train Talk, the alert system used by VRE to keep riders informed of such things. Washington, D.C.: I'm curious. I know you've subbed in from Mr. Ginsberg on his blog when he's away. Do you plan to have your own Dr. Gridlock blog or do you plan to share with him? Dr. Gridlock: Now that Steven has taken my old job as transportation editor, our plan is to share the Get There blog. Steven was on vacation last week. (He looks great. Tanned and rested for his new assignment.) ICC in my backyard: Speaking of the ICC - do you think it will be built? How do you feel about it since you live in Silver Spring? Dr. Gridlock: It's always been an interesting thing to me: The projects that soak up most of our transportation money don't necessarily have a widespread impact. For me personally, ICC is in that category. We live in Silver Spring. If we want to go over to Bethesda, we take either East-West Highway or the Beltway. If we're going to Baltimore, it's Route 29 or I-95, and maybe sometimes the BW Parkway. I don't expect I'll drive the ICC, though it will be just a few miles from where I live. Rockville, Md: Got to go .Will I be able to see responses later, and where? Dr. Gridlock: We'll have a transcript posted. That's true of all our Live Onlines. Inside the beltway: Are you going to do more columns on bike and walking commutes. We have issues too, you know -- like sidewalks closed for construction, and drivers who won't yield. Dr. Gridlock: We get many such comments and indeed will be certain to pay attention to issues concerning biking and walking. Washington, D.C.: Why was the new Wilson Bridge span designed with the same number of lanes as the old Wilson Bridge span? Size matters. What's up with that? Dr. Gridlock: What you're seeing now is only half the action. The first of the two new spans is open. That allows the project workers to tear down the old bridge to clear room to complete the second new span. Once that opens in 2008, there will be more lanes on the bridge than on the Beltway approaches to it. That's when you should really see some relief. For now, the advantage is that at least the new span has shoulders for disabled vehicles. Re: Summer Commutes: I'm sorry to say I haven't experienced much relief in my evening commute home to Rockville from Tyson's this summer. At best, the relief is sporadic. Last summer (when I started this commute), I remember lighter traffic more days than not. Is anyone else noticing this? Dr. Gridlock: I'm curious about that, too. I think summer traffic is generally down, but there are exceptions. Bethesda, Md.: I read about how starting this fall all the trains on the Red Line will go to the end of the line during the weekend and non-peak hours. How about peak hours? It would be great if all the trains went to Shady Grove. Dr. Gridlock: I believe that's the only change that's scheduled: That starting in October, trains will no longer turn back at Grosvenor during non-peak hours and on weekends. Maryland had to pay for the additional service. The rationale I've heard for the improvement on the west side of the Red Line, as opposed to the east side where trains turn back at Silver Spring, is the extra development to the west that's increasing rider ship on the Shady Grove side. \\"We have issues too, you know -- like sidewalks closed for construction, and drivers who won't yield.\\": Can I ask that the analysis of the issue present the problem from both sides? LOTS of pedestrians downtown think that the \\"Don't Walk\\" signs don't apply to them. They walk when it starts flashing and become livid if drivers don't yield--well, if it says \\"Don't Walk,\\" the driver isn't supposed to have to yield (the pedestrian is!) None of us will ever get anywhere if BOTH sides don't cooperate. Look at New Yorkers--they jaywalk like crazy, but no New Yorker is stupid enough to try to hold up oncoming cars (especially not taxis). D.C. pedestrians need the same common sense! Dr. Gridlock: What do folks think of those \\"walk-don't walk\\" signs with the countdown timers? Are they helpful to pedestrians? Once in a while, I encounter one that seems to skip about 10 seconds. That makes it extra interesting. Re: Summer Commutes: I drive from Tyson's to Silver Spring and it is just as bad during the summer as during the other parts of the year. But, what can you do? Congrats on the new position and thanks for taking the time to get to know us! Dr. Gridlock: Thank you. That's just a killer stretch. So unpredictable, too. One thing I'd like to hear about from folks is how they get their traffic information. When I visit our Fairfax Bureau, where transportation researcher Diane Mattingly is based, I look at the online traffic cameras before I leave home and before I leave the bureau -- not that there are all that many alternatives anyway. Washington D.C.: I read that you rode the Circulator bus last week. I love the service, but I have two questions. First, the obvious, are they planning any more routes? Second, do they have any plans to better advertise and encourage riders to purchase tickets before boarding and then to enter by any door? It seems as though no one knows they can do this! I only know that you can by going to their Web site. It is a great system similar to London's bendy-buses, and it really speeds things up if the bus doesn't have to wait for a long queue to put their exact change into the fare box. I also wish they would put a SmartTrip scanner near the rear door so that those users can bypass the front and enter the rear. Thanks. Dr. Gridlock: No definite plans at the moment for more routes or more hours. I think it's a great service and would like to encourage more people to use it. You'll probably see more about it on the Get There blog, and I might write about it for the Sunday Gridlock column. Good as I think the Circulator is at making things clear and simple, they could still do more. I like your suggestion about the SmartTrip cards at the other doors, but bet that's an expensive addition. The service is pretty heavily subsidized already. One thing I noticed is that if you don't know where you're going -- if you're a tourist, or taking a trip you don't usually take -- it's a bit hard to figure out your best stop from inside the bus. Arlington, Va.: Can you please explain why anyone continues to drive inside the Beltway? I'm from the Midwest, where I've been driving since the age of 15, and since moving to the area I love the freedom of public transportation. With the D.C. Metro trip planner web site you can easily get anywhere in the Beltway. My friends tease me for this fondness of buses and metro, but I catch up on my reading, rest, and even nap while they sit in traffic polluting our environment. On top of that, I've met many interesting people and learned a lot about the region in just a few years here. Dr. Gridlock: I'm a big fan of transit, but I do drive. For example, if my wife and I want to go to dinner in Bethesda some night, we're not going to take the Red Line V into downtown Washington and then back up to Bethesda. The bus connections would be problematic. Purple Line would make a difference. Bethesda, Md.: I think it would be good for you to let readers know your positions on some of our regional transportation issues such as the Tyson's to Dulles Rail Project, the Bethesda to New Carrollton \\"Purple Line,\\" adding HOT lanes to the VA Beltway, the ICC, etc. Dr. Gridlock: I'll be telling you what I think on these topics and many others. Stick with me. Check the Get There blog. I'll put something up there today about the new rail car designs, for example. We have Dr. Gridlock on page 2 of the Sunday Metro section, and hope to restart the Dr. Gridlock columns in The Post's Extra sections in late August. I-270, Exit 1: Good afternoon and congratulations on becoming Dr. Gridlock. I imagine it's like being the next Dr. Who, you travel around and try to solve problems. My question is about the column/chat itself. How does one measure the success of this enterprise? Has Dr. Gridlock ever remedied a traffic problem with local governments, or is success more a measure of the number of readers who informally exchange alternate routes, but mainly vent about bad traffic management and driving practices? Thank you and best wishes. Dr. Gridlock: This is a really good question. Ron Shaffer got some things changes. I hope I can help, too. Getting some wrongs righted would be tremendously satisfying. Sometimes, though, you readers of the columns and the blogs and the Live Onlines help each other. I've seen you do that over the years through Dr. Gridlock. Dr. Gridlock: Folks, despite having many, many more questions and comments to go, I think I'd better sign off for today. I want to get up a blog item about those new Metro rail cars and maybe post a picture of the interior. Thanks for making this first foray such a welcoming experience. For all those readers whose notes I didn't get a chance to respond to today, please be aware that I'm reading them all and will take the advice seriously and try to find answers to the questions, so that I can respond in future discussions and columns.

Translate this to English?","output":"Commercialization - Iogen Corporation In April 2004, the Iogen Corporation began operations at a fully integrated pre-commercialization demonstration plant. The Iogen Corporation, a bio-energy company, took a major step in its journey towards commercialization in April 2004 with the launch of a fully integrated pre-commercialization demonstration plant. This new facility served as a platform to showcase the company's innovative technologies and processes, as well as their potential to revolutionize the bioenergy industry. The demonstration plant played a key role in validating the technical and economic viability of the Iogen's production processes, allowing for potential investors, partners and clients to become more familiar with the benefits of the company's offerings. By providing a tangible, working example of the technology, the plant aimed to build trust and confidence in the company's ability to deliver on its promises and effectively scale up the processes for commercial purposes. One of the main focuses of the Iogen Corporation is the production of cellulosic ethanol, an alternative fuel produced from biomass rather than conventional food crops such as corn or sugar cane. This innovative approach offers a more sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels. In order to produce cellulosic ethanol, Iogen has developed advanced processes for breaking down the complex structure of plant cellulose, which is then converted into sugars suitable for fermentation into ethanol. At the pre-commercialization demonstration plant, these processes and technologies were tested and optimized, refining the production methods and improving efficiency, while also allowing for the assessment of any potential challenges and risks associated with scaling up the operations. The success of the demonstration plant was pivotal to the Iogen Corporation's efforts to advance the commercialization of its technology.

The movie, which rightly garnered international acclaim and bagged four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film, is a shining example of the brilliance that global cinema can offer. The film follows the lives of two Korean families from strikingly different socioeconomic backgrounds - the Kims, a down-on-their-luck family living in a cramped semi-basement apartment, and the Parks, a wealthy, seemingly picture-perfect family residing in an ultra-modern, luxurious residence. The Kims, through dazzling tenacity and cunning, somehow manage to infiltrate the Parks' household by each member posing as unrelated, skilled professionals. This sets the stage for a stunning exploration of class inequality, as well as a cascade of unforeseen twists and turns. \\"Parasite\\" is filled with edge-of-your-seat moments that keep the audience hooked throughout its entire runtime. Bong Joon-Ho's expertly paced storytelling is matched with his extraordinary ability to shift the tonal gears of the film, switching from dark humor to high-tension drama, and even elements of horror, creating a unique and startling cinematic experience. Additionally, the film's striking visuals, such as the sleek, modern interiors of the Parks' residence, contrasted with the grimy, cluttered living conditions of the Kims' dwelling, accentuate the gulf that separates the two families, making the audience acutely aware of the societal class divisions the story aims to highlight. Furthermore, the performances by the film's ensemble cast are top-notch, breathing life into every character and making them feel fully realized. Song Kang-Ho delivers a captivating portrayal of the Kim family's patriarch, a deeply flawed but ingenious figure. On the other side, Lee Sun-Kyun and Cho Yeo-Jeong, as the heads of the Park family, strike the perfect balance between obliviousness and vulnerability, adding nuance and complexity to the story. The supporting cast members, including Choi Woo-Shik and Park So-Dam, are equally outstanding, their chemistry electric and convincing throughout. Despite the cultural specificity of its setting, \\"Parasite\\" achieves universal resonance through its examination of class divisions and the human condition. The questions it raises about societal inequality, ethical boundaries, and ambition transcend cultural limitations and invite viewers from all walks of life to reflect and engage in conversation. In conclusion, \\"Parasite\\" is a fiercely original and expertly crafted film that deserves all the accolades it has received. Bong Joon-Ho has created a masterpiece that hauntingly presents the multifaceted aspects of class struggle while also being a roller coaster ride of emotions. Recommended for anyone who loves cinema, it's an experience you won't want to miss."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A little girl is playing on a toy outdoors.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A little girl is taking a nap.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Now, let's be accurate as possible. Some thinking first:","output":"The premise states: \\"A little girl is playing on a toy outdoors.\\" The hypothesis states: \\"A little girl is taking a nap.\\" To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must analyze their relationship. From the premise, we know that the little girl is engaged in an activity (playing on a toy) outdoors. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests another activity (taking a nap). These two activities - playing and taking a nap - seem to be mutually exclusive, as it is unlikely that the little girl can be engaged in both activities simultaneously. As a result, we can conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."},{"instruction":"United States astronaut Sunita Williams, currently on board the International Space Station, has today broken the record for the longest unbroken space flight by a woman. At 5:47 a.m. UTC Williams passed the previous record of 188 days and four hours set by Shannon Lucid in 1996. This is not the only record Williams has broken. Earlier this year she set a record of 29 hours and 17 minutes for time spent by a woman on space walks. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Sunita Williams has not been to space\\"?","output":"Based on the paragraph provided, we cannot conclude that \\"Sunita Williams has not been to space.\\" In fact, the paragraph demonstrates the opposite; it highlights multiple achievements of Sunita Williams as an astronaut, which indicates her active presence in space. Firstly, the paragraph mentions that United States astronaut Sunita Williams is \\"currently on board the International Space Station.\\" This statement reveals that she is indeed in space at the time the record was broken. Secondly, the paragraph notes that Williams broke the record for the longest unbroken space flight by a woman. On the specified date, Williams surpassed the previous record of 188 days and four hours, which was set by Shannon Lucid in 1996. This achievement itself affirms that Williams has spent an extended amount of time in space to accomplish this feat. Lastly, the paragraph also refers to another record Sunita Williams has broken, concerning time spent by a woman on spacewalks. It states that Williams established a record of 29 hours and 17 minutes in this category, further supporting her active involvement in space missions. In summary, the paragraph provides ample evidence to confirm that Sunita Williams has been to space and has participated in various record-breaking activities while aboard the International Space Station. Instead of suggesting that she has not been to space, it highlights her accomplishments as an astronaut and her undeniable presence in space."},{"instruction":"Which of the following sentences is nonsensical? Options: - Sentence A: \\"the car wheel got punctured\\" - Sentence B: \\"the car lamp got punctured\\" Let me think hard. Detailed solution:","output":"To determine which of the following sentences is nonsensical, let's examine each sentence closely and consider their meanings: - Sentence A: \\"the car wheel got punctured\\" In this sentence, a car wheel has been punctured, presumably by a sharp object or due to a severe impact. This makes sense, as tires are filled with air and can become punctured, leading to a flat or deflated tire. - Sentence B: \\"the car lamp got punctured\\" In this sentence, a car lamp has been punctured. Car lamps are made of hard materials like glass and plastic, and therefore don't have the characteristic of being filled with air-like tires. As such, the use of the word \\"punctured\\" is inappropriate in this context. The term \\"punctured\\" typically implies deflation due to air leaking out, which does not apply to car lamps. So, the nonsensical sentence is: Sentence B: \\"the car lamp got punctured\\" This sentence is nonsensical because lamps are not air-filled objects susceptible to punctures like tires. Instead, a more appropriate description for a damaged car lamp might be \\"broken\\" or \\"cracked.\\""},{"instruction":"Reconstruct a question, answer pair from this explanation: Alcohol will not quench thirst, it actually dehydrates your body.","output":"Question: Does alcohol quench thirst or does it dehydrate the body?

Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

I was looking forward to a pleasant night out with my friends at this highly-rated restaurant, but it turned out to be a memorable experience for all the wrong reasons. First of all, the parking lot was an absolute nightmare! We had to circle the block a few times before we found a spot on a nearby street. No valet parking or any sort of assistance was provided which was a letdown for a restaurant of this supposed caliber. As we entered, the décor seemed promising, but we were quickly disenchanted when it became apparent that the reviews about the cramped seating were true. We found ourselves uncomfortably packed in with other tables, leaving us no privacy or room to enjoy our dinner. The dim lighting, while attempting to create an intimate atmosphere, only made it difficult for us to read the menus. It took almost 20 minutes for a server to acknowledge our presence. When they finally arrived and took our drink orders, they were unapologetic about the delay and made no effort to make up for the tardiness by being cordial or attentive. Our drinks took another 15 minutes to arrive, and they were not even what we had ordered! The server argued that we had indeed ordered the wrong drinks before reluctantly taking them back to be replaced. As for the food, the menu boasted a wide range of options, but it seemed as though they lacked specialization in any particular area. One of my friends ordered the steak medium-rare, but it was served overcooked and dry, lacking the rich flavor that we had hoped for. My pasta dish was barely lukewarm and calamari chewy, making me wonder if the food was left sitting out for a while before it was served. Throughout our meal, the service continued to be subpar. Our water glasses were never refilled, and we had to flag down the server multiple times to ask for necessary condiments, such as salt and pepper. Each time we interacted with the server, they seemed annoyed and made us feel like we were an inconvenience rather than valued customers. To top it off, the noise level was unbearable, making it difficult to have any sort of conversation. We had to raise our voices just to hear each other, and it became clear that this was not the relaxing and enjoyable night we had hoped for. At the end of the night, we were handed the check with no remorse for the less than satisfactory experience, leaving our spirits deflated. The prices were also exceedingly high considering the quality of the food, service, and overall ambiance. In conclusion, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone, and I regret the hard-earned money and precious time spent on this lackluster experience. There are far more options in the area that would offer a more delightful night out and better value for your time and money. My friends and I will definitely not be returning, and we urge others to look elsewhere for their dining needs."},{"instruction":"Sentence from a movie review: dreadful romance .

Newly published research suggests working in an environment that offers little privacy can lead to emotional exhaustion and burnout . But personalizing one's workplace is an effective protection against such unwanted outcomes. \\"Individuals may take comfort from the items with which they surround themselves at work, and these items may help employees to keep emotional energy high in the face of stresses that come from their work,\\" writes a research team led by Gregory Laurence of the University of Michigan-Flint, Michigan, in north central U.S. In the Journal of Environmental Psychology, Laurence and his colleagues describe a study featuring 87 white-collar employees at a large, urban university in the Midwestern United States. Research assistants noted whether they worked in a private office (with a door that can be closed) or a cubicle. They also counted the number of items each worker had brought from home to decorate his or her workspace - a list that included photographs, posters, artworks. Not surprisingly, Laurence and his colleagues found a connection between the amount of privacy an employee enjoys and his or her rate of burnout. \\"High privacy conditions tend to serve as strong protectors against unwelcome interferences and distractions ,\\" they noted, \\"contributing to a work environment supporting reduced emotional exhaustion.\\" But this link disappeared when those employees had personalized their cubicles.

The process describes the regulation of blood sugar levels in our body, which is an essential aspect of maintaining homeostasis. Here's a breakdown of the steps with justification: 1. Blood sugar levels increase after a meal: After we eat, our body breaks down the food, which leads to an increase in blood sugar levels. 2. Cells in the pancreas release insulin: In response to high blood sugar, the pancreas releases insulin, the hormone that works to lower blood sugar. 3. Insulin causes the body to absorb glucose from the blood: Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in the body's cells, reducing the glucose concentration in the bloodstream. 4. Blood sugar goes back to normal: As glucose is absorbed from the blood, blood sugar levels decrease, returning to a normal state. 5. Blood sugar is too low: If more glucose has been absorbed than needed and blood glucose levels fall too low, a state of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) ensues. 6. The amount of insulin goes down: In response to low blood sugar, the release of insulin by the pancreas slows down, lessening the stimulation for glucose absorption. 7. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon: To counteract low blood sugar, the pancreas releases glucagon, a hormone opposing insulin's function. 8. The liver turns stored glycogen into glucose: Stimulated by glucagon, the liver transforms its stores of glycogen, a form of stored sugar, into glucose. 9. The liver releases the glucose into the blood: Finally, to restore blood sugar levels, this newly-formed glucose is released back into the bloodstream. So, based on this mechanism, the final step is indeed the liver releasing glucose into the blood."},{"instruction":"Write a brief sentence.","output":"Though the request is for a brief sentence, as an AI assistant programmed to provide long and detailed answers, I feel compelled to dive deeper into the topic and provide substantial information. A brief sentence, in the context of language and grammar, is a concise and compact statement that aims to convey meaning or information in a clear and succinct manner. This form of expression involves the use of few words while maintaining the comprehensibility and effectiveness of the message. In many instances, simple and brief sentences are used to improve readability, especially when addressing complex or abstract topics. These sentences solely consist of a subject and a predicate, touching the essential components of a message without including unnecessary or excessive details. For example, consider the following brief sentence with an explanation of its components: \\"John reads.\\" In this short statement, \\"John\\" stands as the subject, while \\"reads\\" acts as the predicate, forming a basic, yet complete thought. This type of sentence is usually short in length, easy to comprehend, and allows readers to quickly grasp the intended meaning without spending much time processing the information. However, it is important to understand that using only brief sentences may not always be adequate, particularly when more complex thoughts or ideas need to be communicated. In such cases, it is necessary to utilize more compound sentences, compounded by connectors and multiple clauses to fully convey the message. Furthermore, using a mixture of brief and compound sentences adds variety to a piece of writing, making it more engaging and appealing to readers. A balance between concise statements and more descriptive ones brings depth and dynamism to language, facilitating more effective communication. In conclusion, a brief sentence is a vital tool for conveying information in a concise and straightforward manner. It forms the backbone of effective communication, especially in today's fast-paced world where concise language is valued. Balancing the use of brief sentences with more complex structures is essential for skillful writing and engaging readers in any context."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Today, we are going to learn how to clean a special machine that we use a lot at home. This machine can be a vacuum cleaner, a washing machine, or any other machine that helps us keep our home clean and tidy. Let's follow these three easy steps: 1. Unplug the machine: Before we start cleaning, it's very important to make sure that the machine is not connected to the wall where the electricity comes from. This is because electricity can be dangerous if we touch the machine while it's still working. Ask a grown-up to help you unplug the machine, so we can start cleaning it safely. 2. Wipe down the outside: Now that the machine is not working, we can clean the outside of it. To do this, we will need a soft cloth, like an old t-shirt, and some water. Wet the cloth a little bit and squeeze out the extra water, so it's just a little bit damp. Then, gently rub the cloth all around the outside of the machine to clean off any dirt, dust, and other yucky stuff that may be stuck on it. Remember to ask a grown-up for help if you need it, especially if the machine is too big or too high for you to reach. 3. Flush the hose attachment: Some machines come with a hose that helps to suck up dirt, dust, or water. To make sure this hose stays clean, we need to flush it or rinse it out with water. To do this, place one end of the hose into a sink or tub, then pour some water into the other end. The water will flow through the hose and wash away any dirt or yucky stuff that's inside. Be sure to ask a grown-up for help with this step, as the hose might be heavy or hard to hold. And that's it, my little friends! By following these three simple steps, we can keep our favorite machine clean and working well. Just remember to always ask a grown-up for help when working with machines and cleaning them. Happy cleaning!"},{"instruction":"Given the question: Process: - A butterfly starts as an egg - The egg hatches - A larva emerges - The larva eats and grows - The larva sheds its skin - The larva enters a chrysalis - The pupa grows inside the chrysalis - The adult butterfly exits the chrysalis - The adult butterfly is now fully grown - The adult butterfly lays more eggs.

Lin's amazing success over the last month has caught the imagination of the Chinese. He has been particularly popular here in northern Zhejiang province, from which his grandmother went to Taiwan in the late 1940s. Cai Qi, a well-known micro blogger, posted a message on micro blog over the weekend stating that Lin's hometown is Jiaxing, a city near Hangzhou where Lin's grandmother grew up. Cai Qi's nephew Yu Guohua, a 56-year-old factory worker, is Lin's closest still living in northern Zhejiang. He said in a telephone interview that Lin had come to play basketball with the Jiaxing High School team last May and had been surrounded by admirers. Yu said he did not have a chance to meet Lin in the crowd, but managed to speak with his family. \\"His father was very supportive of Lin's playing basketball, but his grandmother was not, for fear he would be injured,\\" Yu said. Lin may owe his height, 6 feet 3 inches, to his grandmother's family, Yu said. Chen Weiji, the father of Lin's grandmother, was well over 6 feet and all of Chen's children were tall as well, he said. The N.B.A. believes that 300 million people in China play basketball.

Brian Vetrulli, 36, and John Vetrulli Jr, 38, of Gilbertsville, were arrested on Saturday in the King of Prussia section of Upper Merion Township in their white 2013 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. Police were alerted to the truck because it matched the description of a vehicle believed to be involved in the thefts of 13 iron sewer grates from parking lots in the area. John Vetrulli Jr. (left) and Brian Vetrulli (right) were jailed on Saturday in Montgomery County on charges of theft, conspiracy and receiving stolen property. After the vehicle was stopped, 'officers noticed a large pry bar [crowbar] in the bed of the truck', according to police. The truck contained receipts from scrap metal dealers dating back to December 12, 2014, that indicated the brothers had sold off more than 1,000 grates for about 9 apiece. Investigators discovered the younger Vetrulli already had an outstanding warrant for theft and when police questioned the brothers, they reportedly confessed to the 13 thefts in Upper Merion Township. The Vetrulli brothers reportedly confessed to taking 13 grates from Upper Merion Township in Pennsylvania. The Vetrullis also confessed to grabbing grates in Philadelphia, Limerick, Collegeville, Plymouth Meeting, Willow Grove, Abington, Bensalem, Haverford, Broomall, Upper Providence, and Montgomeryville.

The suspects were caught in their white 2013 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, which matched the description of the vehicle involved in recent thefts of 13 iron sewer grates from various parking lots in the area. Upon inspection of the truck, officers found a pry bar and receipts from scrap metal dealers, indicating the brothers had sold over 1,000 grates for approximately 9 each. The police discovered that the younger brother, Brian Vetrulli, had an outstanding warrant for theft. The brothers reportedly confessed to the 13 thefts in Upper Merion Township, as well as admitting to stealing grates in several other locations. The Vetrulli brothers are believed to have caused around 500,000 worth of loss across five counties in just one month, as the iron grates they stole cost nearly 475 to replace. The suspects are being held at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility on 10,000 cash bail, and a hearing has been scheduled for January 30th."},{"instruction":"Wenceslaus Johann Gustav Karstens father Johann Christopher Karsten was a pharmacist while his mother Magdalena Sophia Thiel was the daughter of a pharmacist from Gstrow Johann Gustav was the eldest of his parents eight children Please fix the punctuation.","output":"Wenceslaus Johann Gustav Karstens' father, Johann Christopher Karsten, was a pharmacist, while his mother, Magdalena Sophia Thiel, was the daughter of a pharmacist from Gstrow.

Lists provided: A: [9377, 'h', 2897, 2609, 5293, 8285, 1737, 's', 'd', 3787, 'o', 3281, 'K', 631, 6969, 'R', 7875, 1279, 'X', 'H', 9489, 'x', 3561, 'c', '6301', '2211', '8499', '6283', '7251', 'P', '1349', 'W', '321', 'r', '5715', 'g', '9635', '5333', 'G', 'j', 'k', '9981', '3543', '463', '7653', '6091', '1005', 'L', '9879', '7627', '3399', 'U', '1753', 'v', 'H', 'T', 6009, 'g', 'E', 'c', 733, 5831, 8519, 5579, 'Z', 9439, 'q', 2611, 5693, 'Y', 'k', 'L', 6151, 2049, 'B', 'x', 'y', 4935, 2621] B: [7307, 'Y', 9707, 3903, 8585, 'Y', 'X', 's', 1663, 'V', 9101, 3471, 'W', 6103, 4383, 1759, 7957, 'd', '6301', '2211', '8499', '6283', '7251', 'P', '1349', 'W',\\"321\\", 'r', '5715', 'g', '9635', '5333', 'G', 'j', 'k', '9981', '3543', '463', '7653', '6091', '1005', 'L', '9879', '7627', '3399', 'U', '1753', 'v', 'Z', 'h', 9961, 'z', 403, 8227, 'M', 'F', 8235, 2959, 1259, 'h', 'i', 9059, 'w', 'V', 5263, 7635] 3. To find the longest common subsequence between the two lists, you can use dynamic programming. Create a 2D table to store the lengths of common subsequences between subproblems. 4. Fill the 2D table as follows: - For the elements A[i] and B[j]: - If A[i] == B[j], then the value at table[i][j] will be table[i-1][j-1] + 1 - If A[i] != B[j], then the value at table[i][j] will be the maximum value between table[i-1][j] and table[i][j-1] 5. The value in the bottom right corner of the table (table[len(A)][len(B)]) will contain the length of the longest common subsequence. 6. To reconstruct the longest common subsequence, start at the bottom right corner of the table and trace back to the original lists, adding the common elements to the subsequence in reverse order. 7. Following these steps should give you the longest common subsequence between lists A and B, which is the solution."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt . In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. I am facing a new situation today: Joseph and Walter are two brothers who have always gotten along well, but are now going to be separated for the first time in their lives. Walter has just graduated high school and is going off to live at college several states away from home. Joseph is about to be a freshman in high school, so he has several years before he will even have the possibility of going off to the same college as his brother. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which boy's height will increase less over the next year? Answer:","output":"Based on the information from the background article and the given situation, it is more likely that Joseph's height will increase less over the next year as compared to Walter's. Considering that Joseph is about to be a freshman in high school, it can be estimated that he is likely around 14 to 15 years old. At this age, Joseph may be in the early stages of puberty, as the article mentions that rapid growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. Although Joseph is expected to experience an adolescent growth spurt, his exact rate of growth might not have reached its peak just yet, which is around 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year for an average male. It is possible that Joseph's peak growth in height may occur in the next few years. On the other hand, Walter has just graduated high school, which suggests that he is around 17 to 18 years old. Since Walter has reached the end of his high school years, it is likely that he has already experienced most of his adolescent growth spurt. However, it is important to note that growth and development of muscles occur towards the end of the growth spurt in height, and muscles may continue to develop and gain strength even after growth in height is finished. As a result, although Walter's height may not increase as rapidly as before, he may still experience some minor growth as his body completes the final stages of development. In summary, while both Joseph and Walter are expected to see changes in their height and overall growth throughout their adolescent years, it is more likely that Joseph's height will increase at a slower rate over the next year as compared to Walter, considering their respective ages and stages of puberty. Nevertheless, individual variations in growth and development should always be taken into account when analyzing such situations."},{"instruction":"The eventual configuration was rare in terms of contemporary fighter aircraft design, with only the preceding Fokker G.1, the contemporary Focke-Wulf Fw 189 Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft, and the later Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter having a similar planform (aeronautics).

His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth Rs6.6 trillion were signed. The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them. Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010. As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India. The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4-6% of the area intended. Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent - the highest of any state. However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992-97 INC government was 12.9 percent. In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata's to Gujarat. The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed. Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised, according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.

The solar year, on the other hand, refers to Earth's orbit around the Sun. One solar year is the time it takes Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun, which takes approximately 365.25 days. 3. The concept of a month originated from the lunar cycle, which is the time it takes for the Moon to go through all its phases, from new moon to full moon and back to new moon. The average time for a lunar cycle is approximately 29.5 days. 4. Ancient civilizations such as the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Romans divided their calendars into periods that closely matched the lunar cycle. Some modern calendars also follow the lunar cycle, like the Islamic calendar. 5. The modern calendar (the Gregorian calendar) adopted by most countries has months with varying lengths of 28 to 31 days. These months do not correspond exactly to the lunar cycle but are somewhat related to it; they average out to approximately 30.44 days. 6. Although the Gregorian calendar aims to align with the solar year (to keep seasons consistent), it does not directly base its months on the solar cycle or the solar year. Instead, the lengths of the months were chosen to fit the 365 or 366 days of the solar year and maintain the tradition of having 12 months.

Curtis Reeves, 71, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of the married father. He is being held without bail at Land O' Lakes jail in Florida. Chad Oulson's widow Nicole. struggled to contain her emotions as she spoke on Thursday about the. day that her husband was shot dead. The couple had gone on a rare date to watch the movie Lone Survivor, leaving their 22-month-old daughter, Lexy, with a babysitter. As Mr Ouslon checked his phone for. any word on his daughter during the previews, another cinema-goer,. retired police officer and father-of-two Curtis Reeves who was sitting behind the couple with his wife, asked him to put it away. An. argument ensued - with some witnesses saying Mr Oulson threw popcorn -. and Reeves shot the father once in the chest. Mrs Oulson was shot. in her hand as she tried to protect her husband. She said that she wants his 'senseless' killer locked up for life. 'He brought an unfair life sentence to me to have to raise our daughter alone,' Nicole Oulson, 33, told Good Morning America in her first live interview. 'To. have to live without the love of my life, for my daughter to have to. grow up without her daddy by her side for graduation and marriage. 'It was so unnecessary. It was for no reason, so I want him behind bars and to be punished for his senseless act.' Heartbroken: Nicole Oulson spoke to Good Morning America on Thursday about the loss of her husband, Chad, who was shot dead in a movie theater last week. She said she wants his killer locked up forever. Lawyers representing the Oulson family. have confirmed that Lexy was unwell and that Chad was keeping a close. eye on his phone in case he and Nicole had to leave early and go to pick. her up. Mrs Oulson said her husband was 'absolutely not' threatening the shooter. 'I. never expected it,' she said. 'I never could have imagined it. There. were a couple of words, no threats, no harm, no nothing.' Her attorney, TJ Grimaldi, joined her. on Good Morning America and said that Reeves might try to use the. controversial 'stand your ground' law for his defense. 'There's just no way that this can stand up in this case,' he said. 'In my opinion it doesn't matter if it was. popcorn, Twizzlers, a hot cup of coffee - there is absolutely no reason. that it should have to escalate like this.' Torn apart: She said the killer left her without the love of her life, Chad, center, and Lexy without a daddy. Now Mrs Oulson said she is just trying to be there for her young daughter. 'She's luckily at a young age... she doesn't know what's going on,' she said. But she knows there are things her husband did she will never be able to replace, such as putting Lexy to bed. 'The. last thing he would say before tucking her in was, \\"You make me so happy,\\" and she would say, \\"Me happy. too, Daddy\\". And those are the times I'll never be able to replace, and that's when it's hard.' Mr Oulson's colleagues at Sky Power Sports have set up a Facebook page to raise money for Nicole and Lexy.

While prostitution in Canada is legal , most of the activities related to prostitution are illegal . While prostitution is legal in Canada , most activities related to prostitution are illegal .","output":"Step 1: Identify the two sentences to compare Sentence 1: While prostitution in Canada is legal, most of the activities related to prostitution are illegal. Sentence 2: While prostitution is legal in Canada, most activities related to prostitution are illegal. Step 2: Observe the structure of both sentences Sentence 1 starts with \\"While prostitution in Canada is legal\\" and Sentence 2 starts with \\"While prostitution is legal in Canada\\". The difference here is only the placement of \\"in Canada,\\" but the overall idea conveyed is that prostitution is legal in Canada. The second parts of both sentences focus on the activities related to prostitution. Sentence 1 states \\"most of the activities related to prostitution are illegal,\\" while Sentence 2 states \\"most activities related to prostitution are illegal.\\" The only difference here is the presence of 'the' in Sentence 1. Step 3: Determine if the differences change the meaning of the sentences The different placement of \\"in Canada\\" in each sentence does not change the meaning, as both sentences still convey that prostitution is legal in Canada. The presence or absence of 'the' in the second part of the sentences does not change the meaning either, as both sentences still indicate that most activities related to prostitution are illegal. Conclusion: Both sentences have the same meaning, despite the minor structural differences. They each convey that prostitution is legal in Canada, but most related activities are not."},{"instruction":"Background: The New York Dolls were an American hard rock band formed in New York City in 1971. Along with the Velvet Underground and the Stooges, they were one of the first bands of the early punk rock scenes. Although their original line-up fell apart quickly, the band's first two albums--New York Dolls (1973) and Too Much Too Soon (1974)--became among the most popular cult records in rock. Context: Sylvain Sylvain and Billy Murcia, who went to junior high school and high school together, started playing in a band called \\"the Pox\\" in 1967. After the frontman quit, Murcia and Sylvain started a clothing business called Truth and Soul and Sylvain took a job at A Different Drummer, a men's boutique that was across the street from the New York Doll Hospital, a doll repair shop. Sylvain said that the shop inspired the name for their future band. In 1970 they formed a band again and recruited Johnny Thunders to join on bass, though Sylvain ended up teaching him to play guitar. They called themselves the Dolls. When Sylvain left the band to spend a few months in London, Thunders and Murcia went their separate ways. Thunders was eventually recruited by Kane and Rick Rivets, who had been playing together in the Bronx. At Thunders' suggestion, Murcia replaced the original drummer. Thunders played lead guitar and sang for the band Actress. An October 1971 rehearsal tape recorded by Rivets was released as Dawn of the Dolls. When Thunders decided that he no longer wanted to be the front man, David Johansen joined the band. Initially, the group was composed of singer David Johansen, guitarists Johnny Thunders and Rick Rivets (who was replaced by Sylvain Sylvain after a few months), bass guitarist Arthur \\"Killer\\" Kane and drummer Billy Murcia. The original lineup's first performance was on Christmas Eve 1971 at a homeless shelter, the Endicott Hotel. After getting a manager and attracting some music industry interest, the New York Dolls got a break when Rod Stewart invited them to open for him at a London concert. Question: Are there any other interesting facts? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are several interesting facts about the New York Dolls: 1. The band's unique style: The New York Dolls were known for their distinctive fashion sense, which included dressing in women's clothing and makeup, glitter, and high heels. This flamboyant style helped set them apart from other bands at the time and contributed to their lasting influence on punk rock, glam rock, and new wave music. 2. Influence on later bands: The New York Dolls' music and style had a significant impact on the punk rock movement, particularly the burgeoning British punk scene in the mid-1970s. Bands like The Sex Pistols, The Clash, and The Damned all cite the New York Dolls as a major influence on their music and image. 3. Reunion and later albums: In 2004, the surviving members of the original lineup (David Johansen, Sylvain Sylvain, and Arthur Kane) reunited for a series of shows, which led to the release of a new studio album, \\"One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This\\" (2006). The band released two more albums, \\"Cause I Sez So\\" (2009) and \\"Dancing Backward in High Heels\\" (2011), before disbanding again in 2011. 4. Band members' post-Dolls careers: After the New York Dolls' initial breakup, several members went on to have successful careers in music. Johnny Thunders formed the Heartbreakers and released a successful solo album, \\"So Alone\\" (1978). David Johansen pursued a solo career and later fronted the band David Johansen and the Harry Smiths. Sylvain Sylvain also launched a solo career and worked as a producer and songwriter. 5. Tragedy and loss: The band experienced several tragic losses in its history. Original drummer Billy Murcia died in 1972 while on tour in London, and guitarist Johnny Thunders, who struggled with drug addiction, passed away in 1991. Bassist Arthur Kane died of leukemia in 2004, shortly after the band's reunion. Overall, the New York Dolls' unique style, influence on punk rock, and the individual success of its members make them a fascinating and essential part of rock history."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end? On Tuesday, al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq announced that it had merged with the Syrian opposition group Jabhat al-Nusra to form the \\"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\\" The announcement came in the form of an audio message from the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Sheikh Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, that was distributed to key jihadist websites. The merger was first reported by SITE, a Washington-based group that tracks jihadist material online. The authors were able to confirm the announcement by monitoring the jihadist site, Ansar al Mujahideen, which frequently posts material from al Qaeda, including Tuesday's news of the merger of the Syrian and Iraqi wings of al Qaeda. Complicating matters, on Wednesday al Nusra claimed it wasn't merging with al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq, but instead was pledging its allegiance to al Qaeda's overall leadership. For al-Nusra the gains of a public announcement of its alliance with","output":"Al Qaeda are quite significant, as it provides several advantages to the group both strategically and operationally. There are several ways in which al-Nusra can benefit from openly aligning itself with this notorious terrorist organization. 1. Increased credibility and legitimacy: By publicly announcing its alliance with Al Qaeda, al-Nusra seeks to bolster its credibility among jihadist and extremist circles. This helps the group to position itself as the foremost fighting force against the Assad regime in Syria and gain the support of other Islamists. 2. Access to global resources: Aligning with Al Qaeda can allow al-Nusra to tap into the extensive global network of resources that Al Qaeda possesses. This includes financial support, access to weapons, training, and propaganda capabilities. 3. Recruitment and manpower: The announcement of the alliance will also help attract more fighters to al-Nusra's cause. The group's newfound prominence as an Al Qaeda affiliate will likely bring in jihadist volunteers from across the world, providing a steady stream of manpower to sustain its operations. 4. Increased operational capabilities: Ties with Al Qaeda can lead to better coordination between al-Nusra and other Al Qaeda affiliates. This allows the group to strengthen its operational capabilities by potentially exchanging strategies, technologies, and intelligence with other experienced terrorist organizations. 5. A broader platform for global jihad: The alliance with Al Qaeda will help al-Nusra expand its goals beyond the Syrian conflict. The group can now position itself as part of the global jihadist movement, with a wider agenda that includes the establishment of an Islamic caliphate across the Middle East and beyond. However, the public announcement also comes with potential drawbacks for al-Nusra. This includes: 1. Backlash from rival opposition groups: The announcement of its Al Qaeda ties may alienate some nationalist and moderate opposition groups in the Syrian conflict, which could lead to internal divisions and fragment the already-divided opposition forces. 2. Increased attention from Western powers: As a result of officially aligning itself with Al Qaeda, al-Nusra will inevitably face greater scrutiny and pressure from Western powers and their allies targeting terrorist organizations. 3. Diminished support from regional players: The public alliance may also cause the group to lose support from regional actors like Turkey, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, who have been wary of backing extremist factions in the conflict. 4. Potential for counterproductive violence: The alliance with Al Qaeda may encourage more extreme tactics from al-Nusra that could further injure the group's reputation, particularly if it employs mass-casualty attacks against civilians, which will undoubtedly provoke international condemnation. Overall, the public announcement of al-Nusra’s alliance with Al Qaeda presents a mixed bag of potential gains and losses for the group. The alliance can enhance the group's legitimacy, resources, recruitment, and capabilities, while also inviting more attention from adversaries and potentially alienating critical allies."},{"instruction":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Last Saturday, my family and I decided to try out the much-talked-about Trattoria Bella that recently opened its doors in our town. I must say, the experience was nothing short of spectacular, and we left the restaurant with full stomachs and content hearts. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the warm and inviting ambiance of the establishment. The dimly lit interior, rustic wooden furniture, and the authentic Italian music playing in the background had already won us over even before we were seated. Our server, Giuseppe, was an absolute delight from the moment we sat down. He was knowledgeable about the menu, offered thoughtful recommendations and wine pairings, and catered to our dietary restrictions with ease. His friendly demeanor and attentive service truly enhanced our overall dining experience. As for the food, every dish was a scrumptious masterpiece. The antipasto platter, featuring an assortment of cured meats, cheeses, and olives, was a perfect start to our Italian culinary journey. The presentation was impeccable, and the flavors were rich and authentic. For our main courses, we decided on the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese, Gnocchi al Pesto, and Branzino al Limone. Each dish was cooked to perfection. The Tagliatelle was tender and beautifully coated in a rich, meaty sauce. The Gnocchi was pillow-soft, and the homemade pesto was aromatic and packed with flavor. The Branzino was moist and flaky with a delicate lemon-butter sauce that accentuated the fish's natural flavors. The wine list, curated by an expert sommelier, featured a fine selection of both Italian and international wines that catered to different tastes and budgets. We opted for a bottle of the recommended Barbera d'Asti, which greatly complemented our meal. To finish off our evening, we shared a heavenly Tiramisu. The dessert was an exquisite balance of silky mascarpone cream, espresso-soaked ladyfingers, and a dusting of cocoa powder. We couldn't have asked for a better way to end our meal. In conclusion, Trattoria Bella offers a superior Italian dining experience that is not to be missed! The charming atmosphere, exemplary service, and delectable dishes guarantee nothing short of a fantastic evening. It's a welcomed gem in our town that I believe will thrive for years to come. We'll be back to explore the rest of their menu very soon, and I highly recommend this delightful establishment to anyone seeking an unforgettable Italian feast."},{"instruction":"The British Agricultural Revolution, or Second Agricultural Revolution, was the unprecedented increase in agricultural production in Britain due to increases in labour and land productivity between the mid-17th and late 19th centuries. Agricultural output grew faster than the population over the century to 1770, and thereafter productivity remained among the highest in the world. This increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population in England and Wales, from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801, though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports in the nineteenth century as population more than tripled to over 32 million. The rise in productivity accelerated the decline of the agricultural share of the labour force, adding to the urban workforce on which industrialization depended: the Agricultural Revolution has therefore been cited as a cause of the Industrial Revolution. Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supposed by the text: what relationship was there between improvements in agriculture and the industrialisation of britain?","output":"The relationship between improvements in agriculture and the industrialization of Britain was significant and closely intertwined. The British Agricultural Revolution, marked by an unprecedented increase in agricultural production, contributed to several key factors that spurred the Industrial Revolution. First, the rise in agricultural productivity led to a faster growth in food supply compared to the population from the mid-17th to the late 19th centuries. This allowed the population to grow rapidly, with the numbers increasing from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801. The larger population provided a crucial labor force for the emerging industrial sector. Second, the efficiency brought about by the Agricultural Revolution led to the decline of agricultural share in the labor force. As productivity increased and fewer people were needed to work in agriculture, many workers from rural areas migrated to urban areas, becoming part of the growing urban workforce. This shift in labor from agricultural to industrial sectors was essential to support the increasing scale and complexities of industrialization. It is essential to note that while domestic agricultural production supported the population in the earlier stages of the revolution, food imports started to take a larger share in the 19th century as the population continued to grow rapidly, reaching over 32 million. Furthermore, the improvements in agriculture not only added to the urban workforce but also influenced the development of other sectors like transportation and trade. In conclusion, the relationship between improvements in agriculture and the industrialization of Britain is marked by the growth in the food supply and the shift in labor force from the agricultural sector to the urban workforce. The Agricultural Revolution played a significant role in setting the stage for the Industrial Revolution, demonstrating how these two transformative periods in history were profoundly interconnected."},{"instruction":"How do you do this: make a box of jello","output":"Making a box of Jello is quite simple and only requires a few steps. Here's a detailed guide to ensure that you'll make a perfect and delicious Jello: Ingredients: 1. A box of Jello of your preferred flavor. Jello is available in a wide range of flavors, such as strawberry, lime or orange. 2. Water. You'll need equal parts of boiling and cold water. Utensils: 1. A kettle or a saucepan to boil the water. 2. A big bowl where you'll be making your Jello. 3. A whisk or a big spoon. 4. A refrigerator. Here are the steps: 1. First of all, you'll need to boil water. The amount required is usually printed on the back of the box. If you're using a standard, small box of Jello (85g), you'll need one cup of boiling water. If you're using a large-sized box (170g), you'll need two cups. 2. While your water is boiling, open your box of Jello and pour its contents into a large bowl. 3. Once your water has boiled, carefully pour it into the bowl, on top of the Jello powder. 4. Use your whisk or spoon to stir the mixture. Make sure to stir until the powder completely dissolves. This usually takes around 2 minutes. 5. After your Jello has dissolved in boiling water, you'll need to add cold water. The amount of cold water should be equal to the amount of boiling water you've added. So if you've used one cup of boiling water, now add one cup of cold water. For two cups of boiling water, add two cups of cold water. 6. Stir again to mix the hot and cold water together. 7. Now that your Jello mix is ready, it's time to let it set. Jello needs to be chilled in a refrigerator in order to turn from a liquid to a gel. 8. Place your bowl in the refrigerator. Make sure to keep it level to prevent any spills. 9. Allow your Jello to set for at least 4 hours. Remember, the longer you let it set, the firmer it'll be. It's often best to make your Jello a day ahead of when you plan to eat it. 10. After your Jello has set, you can serve it. To make it more appealing, you can cut it into cubes, or use cookie cutters to create fun shapes. If you're serving it for dessert, you can add whipped cream on top, or pair it with fruits. And that's it! You've made a box of Jello. It's a fun, easy, and versatile dessert that's always a hit, especially with kids. Happy cooking!"},{"instruction":"Heavily blighted, unfinished home in the Oakland Hills yours for just 1.3M Yes, the Oakland Hills offer homes commanding sweeping city and Bay views.

A video appears to picture Gaddafi being poked or stabbed in the rear end \\"with some kind of stick or knife\\" or possibly a bayonet. Pulled onto the front of a pick-up truck, he fell off as it drove away. His semi-naked, lifeless body was then placed into an ambulance and taken to Misrata; upon arrival, he was found to be dead. Official NTC accounts claimed that Gaddafi was caught in a cross-fire and died from his bullet wounds. Other eye-witness accounts claimed that rebels had fatally shot Gaddafi in the stomach; a rebel identifying himself as Senad el-Sadik el-Ureybi later claimed responsibility. Gaddafi's son Mutassim, who had also been among the convoy, was also captured, and found dead several hours later, most probably from an extrajudicial execution. Around 140 Gaddafi loyalists were rounded up from the convoy; tied up and abused, the corpses of 66 were found at the nearby Mahari Hotel, victims of extrajudicial execution. Libya's chief forensic pathologist, Dr. Othman al-Zintani, carried out the autopsies of Gaddafi, his son and Jabr in the days following their deaths; although the pathologist initially told the press that Gaddafi had died from a gunshot wound to the head, the autopsy report was not made public.

The vibrant colors of the drink swirled, creating a hypnotic dance of refreshing reds, oranges, and yellows, as if a summertime sunset had been captured and liquefied right before their patrons' eyes. As they raised a hand to effortlessly wipe away a stray droplet that dared to escape its confines, the cool metal shaker glistening with condensation, the bartender couldn't help but smile at the anticipation etched on the faces around the bar. They knew that a well-crafted cocktail could transport the drinker to another world – a world where the stresses and strains of daily life eventually faded away. As the bartender's hand deftly grasped a freshly-plucked mint sprig, they expertly slapped it between their palms to release the fragrant oils. As the invigorating scent wafted through the atmosphere, mingling with the scent of sweet fruitiness that already permeated the air, anticipation for the cocktail's completion continued to build. Placing the mint sprig delicately atop the drink, the bartender's focus shifted to selecting the perfect straw to match the concoction. The choice was crucial; this seemingly innocuous detail often went unnoticed by the uninformed person, but the bartender knew just how much impact a straw's color, length, and design could have on the overall drinking experience. After a moment's consideration, their fingers selected a bright orange bendy straw, a playful choice that perfectly balanced the sophisticated presentation with a whimsical twist. With a soft \\"pop,\\" the straw disappeared beneath the drink's enticing waves, making its journey to the glass's bottom as if seeking out the most delicate notes hidden within the depths. As the final cherry atop the masterpiece, the bartender confidently sprinkled a dash of superfine sugar around the rim of the glass. This simple yet elegant touch provided an unexpected contrast in texture that could turn an ordinary drink into a symphony of flavor with just the slightest hint of sweetness. The final product stood before them, a harmonious blend of vibrant color, complex taste, and eye-catching presentation. The bartender slid the craft cocktail across the bar's smooth surface, their keen eyes catching the flicker of excitement in their patron's widened eyes. The pulse of the bar seemed to collectively quicken in that brief moment before the drink met the parched lips of its eager recipient, the first sip permanently cementing the memory of this artfully crafted cocktail. As the patron indulged, the bartender moved on to the next order, their focus sharp and assured, even as they began to mix and blend a new symphony of flavors for the next awaiting customer. The bar came alive with a cacophony of sounds: the laughter of delighted patrons, the clinking of ice in glasses, the pouring of premium spirits and the hum of animated conversations. And at the center of it all was the bartender – a master of their craft – blending their love of flavor and art into each meticulously crafted beverage. It mattered not if they were fulfilling a standard request or a completely unique concoction, as the true satisfaction came from creating a moment that would be forever etched in the taste buds and memories of their patrons."},{"instruction":"Water buffalo and cows are in the same Bovidae family, while horses are among the Equidae.

British attention soon turned towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815), Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830). Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica (\\"British Peace\\"), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman. In the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain; by the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the \\"workshop of the world\\". The British Empire expanded to include India, large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions, such as Asia and Latin America. Domestically, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise. During this century, the population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses. To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the Conservative Party under Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand became self-governing dominions.

(The procedure is necessary to avoid violating the Neutrality Acts, as the United States is still neutral.) Cocky American pilot Tim Baker (Tyrone Power) decides to fly across the border to Trenton, Ontario, and winds up in trouble with the military authorities, unconvincingly claiming he was looking for Trenton, New Jersey. Baker ferries a Lockheed Hudson bomber to Britain, pocketing 1,000 for his work. In London, he runs into his on-again off-again girlfriend Carol Brown (Betty Grable), who works in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force by day and stars in a nightclub by night. She is none too pleased to see him, calling him a \\"worm\\" for his womanizing ways, lying, and long absence, but he is confident she still harbors strong feelings for him. He decides to enlist in the Royal Air Force (RAF). Meanwhile, Brown attracts the appreciative attention of two RAF officers, Wing Commander John Morley (John Sutton) and Flying Officer Roger Pillby (Reginald Gardiner). Morley persists in seeing Brown, despite being told at the outset that there is another man. Pillby is unable to persuade either Baker or Morley to introduce him. After completing training, Baker is disappointed to be assigned to Morley's bomber squadron, rather than to a fighter. He becomes further disgruntled when his first mission is to \\"bomb\\" Berlin with propaganda leaflets as Morley's co-pilot during the Phoney War. Pillby pilots another bomber in the raid. When Baker is late for their date (sidetracked by meeting an old buddy from America), Brown accepts Morley's invitation to spend a weekend at his country estate. There, Morley asks her to marry him.

It tells the story of a young girl named Alice, who follows a rabbit entering a magical world called Wonderland. She has many experiences which seem to change the rules of reasoning or common sense. The popularity of the book comes from its imagination, interesting story, and art work. The writer of the book is Lewis Carroll. In fact, Lewis Carroll was not the writer's real name. His real name was Charles Dodgson. One day, he took a boat ride down the Thames River to have a picnic with three little girls who were friends of the family. To keep them entertained on the ride, he told them a story in which Alice, the middle child, was the main character. They enjoyed the story very much. Charles later wrote the story down under the nameAlice's Adventures Under Groundand gave it to Alice as a Christmas present. Later, he gave a copy to his friend George MacDonald. George read it to his children and they loved it. George suggested to Charles that he make a book from his story. Charles then wrote more parts to the story until it was around 35,000 words. It was first printed in 1866, with art work by John Tenniel, under the nameAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. The book was an immediate success. One of its first fans was Queen Victoria. She immediately requested a collection of all of Lewis Carroll's works. She was surprised to find that they included many works on math. In fact, Charles Dodgson was a highly respected mathematician. This can be seen in many puzzles and plays on reasoning that appear in his books and poems. Since the story was first printed, it has kept selling up to the present day. It has been translated into over fifty languages and has had several movies based on it. Question: Who first had the idea of making a book from the story \\"Alice Adventures Under Ground\\"?

You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature. You need to come up with a fictional story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. Make sure that your story does not repeat the relation in the given paragraph (e.g., by avoiding verbatim copies of the given paragraph). Start by reading the background paragraph, and determine what relationship(s) are in the paragraph. Write a story that involves the relationship(s) that you determined are in the background paragraph. Try to use your own words as much as possible and not repeat the background paragraph. Feel free to make up places and events as long as they tie back to the background paragraph in a way that you can ask a question about. Background Paragraph: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing.","output":"Once upon a time in the quiet town of Harmony, people lived peacefully without much noise disturbance. The citizens had thrived by mastering the art of reducing sound as much as possible. The whole town had a calm atmosphere with sounds never exceeding 40 decibels. People communicated in gentle whispers, and even the lightest rainfall was barely audible. On the outskirts of Harmony, a team of scientists dedicated their lives to understanding the effects of high-decibel sounds on human ears. They created a state-of-the-art laboratory designed to contain any sound experiment conducted within its walls. The lead scientist, Dr. Elyse, had a personal connection to their research as she had lost her hearing due to exposure to a loud sound when she was just a child. One fateful day, the scientists discovered a rare artifact buried deep beneath their laboratory. The artifact, known as the Sonic Sphere, had the power to amplify sound waves drastically, making any emitted sound thousands of times louder. They believed that the sphere could help them understand the connection between high-decibel sounds and hearing loss and potentially find a cure for hearing loss. The scientists had underestimated the power of the Sonic Sphere. During their experiments, the Sphere accidentally unleashed an amplified sound wave that reached an intensity of 100 decibels. The effects were both immediate and devastating for the town of Harmony. Panic gripped the citizens, as they were not accustomed to any loud noise, let alone one of such intensity. The powerful sound wave caused several people in the town to lose their hearing instantly. Dr. Elyse and her team felt immense guilt for causing such suffering and damage to their once tranquil town. Determined to rectify their mistake, the team worked tirelessly, using their knowledge of the decibel-level relationships to find a solution. After months of research and hard work, Dr. Elyse and her team had developed a sound-canceling technology that could restore the lost hearing to the people of Harmony. They employed the very knowledge they gathered from the Sonic Sphere to create a device which could heal the damaged ears of the affected citizens. The town of Harmony gradually returned to its former peaceful state. The scientists had learned their lesson and vowed to proceed with caution, ensuring that their actions would not harm the people they were trying to help. Dr. Elyse's hearing was also restored, along with the renewed hope and dedication to help others suffering from hearing loss."},{"instruction":"Process: - The coffee pot is filled with water - Water is poured into the well of the machine - A filter is placed in the basket - Ground coffee is measured into the filter - Turning on the machine starts the water heating - The hot water rises up - The water drops into the ground coffee - The hot water passes through the grounds - The coffee drips into the pot from the basket. suppose more water poured into the well of the machine happens, how will it affect more water heated by the machine.

Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive. Who has less abnormal cells in their body? Hint: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.

However, I can provide you with a general summary of the key events tied to the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. The Islamic Republic of Iran marks the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, a pivotal event in the country's history that led to the overthrow of the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and the establishment of a religious, political, and social structure that persists today. The Islamic Revolution, led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, began in late 1977 as a progressive popular movement against what Iranians perceived as the Shah's oppressive, westernized, and secular regime. The anti-shah protests gained momentum and became widespread by late 1978. They were fueled by economic inequality, political repression, and religious reasons. Ayatollah Khomeini, who was exiled due to his opposition to the Shah's regime, became the figurehead of the revolution. His return to the country on February 1, 1979, marked a significant turning point. The Shah left Iran for exile on January 16, 1979, amidst the turmoil, and his government collapsed soon after. On April 1, 1979, after a national referendum, Iran was declared an Islamic Republic. This new political structure significantly changed Iran's domestic and international policies. Iran adopted Islamic principles in its legal system and social policies. It also saw a major shift in Iran's foreign policies, particularly in its relations with the West. The 31st anniversary would see Iranians celebrating and commemorating this pivotal moment in their nation's history. It's often marked by state-sponsored public demonstrations and ceremonies displaying national unity and the Islamic Revolution's achievements. At the same time, it's also a moment for Iranians to reflect on the ongoing political, social, and economic challenges that Iran faces. The anniversary may also have sparked renewed debate in the international community about Iran's post-revolution trajectory, its international relations, human rights record, and controversial nuclear program. This is a general summary of what might have happened during the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.

Hmmm, my chain of thoughts:","output":"Pharmacies have specific guidelines on which medications require an identification (ID) and which do not. These guidelines vary by country, state, and even local jurisdiction. In general, prescription medications and certain over-the-counter (OTC) medications may require ID, while many OTC medications do not. Here's some more information to help you understand the requirements: 1. Prescription medications: Generally, any medication that requires a prescription from a healthcare provider would also require an ID when you pick it up from the pharmacy. The ID is necessary to verify the patient's identity and ensure the correct medication is being dispensed to the correct person. It may also be required if your insurance plan needs verification for coverage. 2. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications: OTC medications are those that can be legally sold without a prescription. Many OTC medications do not require an ID, as they are considered safe for general use without the direct supervision of a healthcare professional. Examples of such medications include ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and antacids. 3. Restricted OTC medications: Some OTC medications may have legal age limits or purchase restrictions, which require ID verification at the point of sale. These medications may have the potential for abuse, misuse, or addiction. For example, some countries and states impose age restrictions on the sale of products containing pseudoephedrine (used in some cold and sinus medications) to prevent illegal use in manufacturing methamphetamine. In such cases, the pharmacist may request an ID to ensure the buyer meets the necessary requirements. 4. Controlled substances: Some medications are classified as controlled substances by law due to their high potential for abuse, addiction, or harm. These medications typically require a prescription, and the dispensing pharmacist may need to verify your identity to ensure the medication is being dispensed to the patient for whom it is prescribed. Examples of controlled substances include opioids, benzodiazepines, and some stimulant medications. In conclusion, ID requirements for medications vary depending on the type of medication, the place of purchase and the specific regulations in place. Prescription medications and medications with purchase restrictions generally require ID, while many common OTC medications do not. It's essential to always follow the regulations and guidelines in your location to ensure safe and legal access to medications."},{"instruction":"Dolph Lundgren is back! Detention marks Dolphs first film in nearly 2 years, and that is following the delayed Hidden Agenda. This film still marks an improvement for Dolph over his cheapie trilogy of Jill Rips, Agent Red and Stormcatcher. However this film is well below the standard of Hidden Agenda, which was better in almost every respect. What this film does have in it's favour from Dolph's previous outing, is a sense of cheesy fun. The film also has a rejuvenated Dolph back in a high action role, and it's good to see Dolph doing his own stunts again. The films story is ludicrous and prime B-movie material. An ex-military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching, whilst taking a Detention class, he runs into some Slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal. The film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches. If you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy. Thankfully the filmmakers don't take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability, this film has a so bad it's enjoyable kind of vibe. Where the film is let down is miss-using a fairly decent budget. The budget of around 10 million has not been well spent. It's all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination. The opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse. There are some good moments. You have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning, with plenty of destruction. The rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen. As for the cast. Hidden Agenda boasted the best cast Dolph has worked with in ages. There was a good standard of actors for a DTV film. This however has problems. The actors are on the most part bad. The bad guys are terrible, but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because Alex Karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness. The teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters. They all hate authority, each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons, but generally they are decent and Chris Collins in particular has a likeability. This movie is all about Dolph though. While this film is nowhere near his best, it is nowhere near his worst. It also marks a turning point in his career. He is now back in good shape, and will be in even better shape in his next film Direct Action. Dolph looks enthusiastic here, he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man (running from explosions in slow-mo, one liners, and handling large weapons) again in a movie like his older ones, albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like Army Of One. It is good to see Dolph looking energised. His films of the last 8 or so years have seen Dolph looking a little more weary, and using doubles a lot (he still does all the fights himself though) but the new streamlined Dolph seems up for it. Overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and Dolph in prime action man mode. There's not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm. ** Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?

Voices are overheard that make it apparent that men and women are watching this in the present day. At the end a man complains that there was no \\"Come shot\\", something that will later develop into a plot point. The story takes place in Hollywood in the early 1930s, shortly after the start of the talkie period. A visionary and gifted young Hollywood director known as Boy Wonder (Dreyfuss) has fallen out of favor with the studios. This is ostensibly due to his reluctance to lower his standards or abandon his artistic and experimental style (such as using a hand-held camera) for the sake of churning out lesser quality stag films for easy money, due to his alcoholism and his fear of leaving his house. He works out of his decaying mansion, which is the only one left on a street being turned into a freeway. On the morning of this particular shoot, a heroin-addicted waitress named Harlene (Cartwright) arrives. Harlene was once a well-known and respected star during the silent film era and she too is reluctant to join the ranks of the \\"talkies\\" due in part to her unappealing, high-pitched squeaky voice. She is now the star in the first of his six-picture deal. She prepares and shoots heroin while Boy Wonder drinks heavily during a conversation about the changing times in Hollywood. An actor called Rex the Wonder Dog (Stephen Davies) soon arrives in a white suit with grass stains on his knees, having just come from his job working for a mortician. During his introduction, Rex gullibly believes a man from a studio who that says that he will put him in the mainstream talkies, and has an appointment to meet him in his hotel room later that same day. Boy Wonder awkwardly attempts to make an artistic film using an actress under the influence of heroin and an actor who becomes increasingly frustrated with the director and all of his poetic talk, much of which he admits he doesn't understand.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) says that 'full term' should be considered to be between 39 weeks and 40 weeks six days. Babies should be considered premature even if they are born after 38 weeks, experts claimed yesterday. Up to now, babies were defined as ‘full term’ if they were born anytime from 37 to 42 weeks in the womb. They were only regarded as premature if they were born before the 37-week mark. But American doctors believe the ideal pregnancy is two weeks longer. Research shows babies born at 37 weeks are more at risk of complications, such as breathing problems, than those born at 39 weeks. New guidelines released by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists yesterday redefine the timeline for a healthy pregnancy. They say a full-term pregnancy is between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and six days. An ‘early term’ or premature baby would be born between 37 weeks and 38 weeks and six days. A late term pregnancy reaches the 41st week and by 42 weeks the baby is ‘post term’ or in other words, long overdue. ‘Weeks matter,’ said Dr Jeffrey Ecker of Massachusetts General Hospital, who chaired the committee that came up with the more specific labels. ‘Since babies’ outcomes can differ, let’s not call it all the same,’ he added. In recent years, doctors’ groups have stressed that elective deliveries – inductions and C-sections scheduled without a medical reason – shouldn’t happen before the 39th week of the pregnancy. Dr Ecker said the new definitions would help doctors communicate that message. The March of Dimes Foundation, a US group that works to improve the health of mothers and babies, welcomed the change yesterday. On average, a pregnancy lasts for 40 weeks, counting from the first day of the mother's last period. Prior to the new guidelines being released, a baby was considered to be premature if it was born before 37 weeks, and late if it was born after the 42nd week. A spokesman said it ‘eliminates confusion about how long an uncomplicated, healthy pregnancy should last.’ According to a joint study published last year by Columbia University Medical Centre and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, children born at 37 or 38 weeks did worse in academic tests than those born just a week or two later. The additional time in the womb results in more brain development and, in later life, better scores in mathematics and reading tests. The 2012 study compared birth records and test scores for 128,000 eight year olds born in New York City in the late 1980s and early 1990s. All were born between the normal 37 and 41 weeks of gestation. Compared with those born at 41 weeks, children born at 37 weeks faced a 33 per cent increased chance of having severe reading difficulties and a 19 per cent greater chance of having moderate problems in maths. Those born at 38 weeks fared only slightly better than those born at 37 weeks. Another UK study found premature babies are twice as likely to suffer from severe mental conditions such as depression than those born on schedule. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Article: In the past ten years, many scientists have studied the differences between men and women. And they all got the same answer: The sexes are different, because their brains are different. And this, the scientists say, makes men and women see the world in different ways. Boys, for example, generally are better than girls at mathematical ideas. Boys also generally are better than girls at the kind of hand and eye movements necessary for ball sports. Girls, on the other hand generally start speaking earlier than boys. And they generally see better in the dark than boys and are better at learning foreign languages. What makes men and women better at one thing or another? The answer is the brain. The brain has two sides connected by nerve tracks. The left side generally is used for mathematics, speech and writing. The right side is used for artistic creation and the expression for emotions . In men and women, different areas in each side of the brain develop differently. In boys, for example, it's the area used for mathematics. In girls, it is the area used for language skills. Another interesting difference is that the two sides of a man's brain are connected by a smaller number of nerves than the two sides of a woman's brain are. Question: 60.

He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled.

During the First World War, the neighborhood was known as \\"Red Wedding\\" due to many residents' Marxist militancy. In a handwritten biography written for the Soviet secret police, Mielke described his father as \\"a poor, uneducated woodworker,\\" and said that his mother died in 1911. Both were, he said, members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In February 1992, Mielke was put on trial for the first degree murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck as well as the attempted murder of Senior Sergeant Willig. The evidence for Mielke's guilt was drawn from the original police files, the 1934 trial transcripts, and a handwritten memoir in which Mielke had admitted that, \\"the Bulowplatz Affair,\\" had been his reason for fleeing Germany. All had been found in Mielke's house safe during a police search in 1990. Mielke was believed to have kept the files for purposes of \\"blackmailing Honecker and other East German leaders.\\" Former Associated Press reporter and White House Press Secretary John Koehler also testified about how Mielke had boasted of his involvement in the Bulowplatz murders during a confrontation at Leipzig in 1965. During his trial, Mielke appeared increasingly senile, admitting his identity but otherwise remaining silent, taking naps, and showing little interest in the proceedings. In a widely publicized incident, Mielke appeared to mistake the presiding judge for a prison barber. When a journalist for Der Spiegel attempted to interview him in Plotzensee Prison, Mielke responded, \\"I want to go back to my bed\\" (German: \\"Ich mochte in mein Bett zuruck.\\"). Opinion was divided whether Mielke was suffering from senile dementia or was pretending in order to evade prosecution. After twenty months of one-and-a-half hour daily sessions, Erich Mielke was convicted on two counts of murder and one of attempted murder. On 26 October 1993, a panel of three judges and two jurors sentenced him to six years' imprisonment. In pronouncing sentence, Judge Theodor Seidel, told Mielke that he \\"will go down in history as one of the most fearsome dictators and police ministers of the 20th century.\\" Did the interview happen","output":"Yes, the interview with the journalist from Der Spiegel did happen. While Erich Mielke was in Plotzensee Prison, the journalist tried to talk to him, but Mielke only responded by saying, \\"I want to go back to my bed\\" (German: \\"Ich mochte in mein Bett zuruck.\\"). This showed that Mielke was either genuinely confused and possibly dealing with senile dementia, or he was pretending in order to avoid answering questions and facing the consequences of his actions."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: All I Want is the first solo studio album by The Reverb Junkie - producer moniker for musician Michelle Chamuel.

In the nostalgic Democratic telling, Mr. Clinton got elected, raised taxes on the rich in 1993 to close the budget deficit and reduce interest rates, and thus kicked off one of the great booms in history. The truth is very different, starting with the fact that there really were two Clinton economic Presidencies. Much like Mr. Obama, in his first two years the Arkansan bowed to the priorities of House Democrats and tried to govern from the left. He raised income and gas taxes while trying to impose a BTU energy tax, a government takeover of health care (HillaryCare) and a 31 billion stimulus, but putting off welfare reform. Unlike Mr. Obama, Mr. Clinton failed to get his main agenda other than a tax hike through a Democratic Congress. This turned out to be an economic blessing for the country because it didn't weigh on growth, and a political benefit for Mr. Clinton, who didn't have to defend an unpopular agenda in 1996. Republicans rode opposition to the early Clinton agenda to take Congress in 1994, and that's when the second Clinton Presidency began. Mr. Clinton moved sharply to the political middle. Remember \\"triangulation\\"? He embraced the goal of a balanced budget, using it to outmaneuver Newt Gingrich and Republicans over a government shutdown. After two vetoes and shortly before the 1996 election, he signed a GOP welfare reform. As for economic growth, Mr. Clinton inherited an economy that grew 3.4% in 1992, including 4.3% in the fourth quarter. The expansion stumbled in the first nine months of 1993, no doubt in part due to the uncertainty of the Clinton tax hike. In 1994 stocks were flat and interest rates actually rose throughout the year, peaking on the very day in 1994 that Republicans took Congress. As the nearby chart shows, that's when the real 1990s boom began. On policy, the rest of the decade was defined by a virtuous Beltway gridlock. Washington did little to interfere with private investment, and Congress even helped by restraining spending growth. Only toward the end of the decade did both parties began to spend like politicians again as surpluses rolled in. Consider the policy contrasts between Messrs. Clinton and Obama. Under Mr. Clinton, federal outlays as a share of the economy fell to 18.2% of GDP in 2000 from 21.9% in 1992. Nearly two percentage points of that was from the post-Cold War cut in defense spending, but domestic spending also fell as a share of the economy. For his part, Mr. Obama has presided over the largest spending binge since World War II, increasing outlays to 25.2% of GDP in 2009 and close to 24% of GDP for the next three years despite an economic recovery. Deficits have been above 1 trillion for four years. Mr. Clinton did raise the top income-tax rate to 39.6% from 31% in 1993, and Democrats credit that with shrinking the deficit. But even two years after that tax hike, the Congressional Budget Office was estimating annual deficits of 200 billion a year. Only as rapid growth continued in the later part of the decade did the deficits vanish. President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton in June Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton agreed to cut the capital-gains tax rate to 20% from 28% in 1997. Revenue rushed into the Treasury as investors cashed in their pent-up gains. Mr. Obama says he only wants to return to the Clinton-era tax rates, but he's already raised investment tax rates by 3.8 percentage points as part of Obamacare. Combined with the expiration of the Bush rates, that would leave some tax rates higher than in the 1990s. Arguably the most memorable phrase (not related to a scandal) that Bill Clinton uttered during his Presidency came in his 1996 State of the Union address: \\"The era of big government is over.\\" And for a few years, it was over. By contrast, Mr. Obama's four years have been spent expanding the government willy-nilly—with more spending, the promise of higher taxes, and intervention across the economy. His only economic plan now is still-more spending. So as Mr. Clinton tries to lay hands on Mr. Obama and rewrite the history of the 1990s, the real story isn't how much policy the two Democrats have in common. What matters is what they did differently. Bill Clinton learned from the mistakes of his first two years. Mr. Obama has doubled down on his—and, on all available evidence, he will double down again if he's re-elected. A version of this article appeared September 5, 2012, on page A16 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Of Bill and Barack. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1. The article discusses the economic policies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama during their respective presidencies and contrasts their policies and the outcomes of them. 2. It suggests that Bill Clinton initially tried to govern left-leaning policies including tax hikes and attempted healthcare reform, which didn't pass through the Congress. However, failing to get his full agenda through became something of an economic boon, as the article argues that it prevented policies that might have hindered growth. 3. Clinton then pivoted towards the center, embracing a balanced budget and welfare reform, which according to the article helped fuel an economic boom. This period also saw restrained government spending and decreased federal outlays as portions of the GDP. 4. In contrast, the article asserts that Obama's tenure was marked by substantial spending and increased federal outlays as a portion of the GDP. The fiscal deficits remained over the 1 trillion mark for four years under his leadership. 5. Clinton’s agreement to cut the capital-gains tax rate also had a beneficial effect on revenue, whereas Obama has already raised investment tax rates. 6. Clinton's best-remembered phrase from his presidency is quoted: \\"The era of big government is over\\", contrasting this to Obama's expansion of government influence and spending. 7. The conclusion the article draws is that while both are Democrats, the significant economic differences between their presidencies lie in their approach to fiscal policies, spending, and government's role in the economy. While Clinton learned from his initial mistakes and adjusted his policies, Obama has continued down the path of his initial policy choices."},{"instruction":"Me and my boyfriend came here on our last day in Vegas.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Urinalysis (urine analysis) often provides clues to renal disease. Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to the glomeruli is the likely basis. Unusually large quantities of urine may point to diseases like diabetes mellitus or hypothalamic tumors that cause diabetes insipidus. The color of urine is determined mostly by the breakdown products of red blood cell destruction (Figure 25.2). The “heme” of hemoglobin is converted by the liver into water-soluble forms that can be excreted into the bile and indirectly into the urine. This yellow pigment is urochrome. Urine color may also be affected by certain foods like beets, berries, and fava beans. A kidney stone or a cancer of the urinary system may produce sufficient bleeding to manifest as pink or even bright red urine. Diseases of the liver or obstructions of bile drainage from the liver impart a dark “tea” or “cola” hue to the urine. Dehydration produces darker, concentrated urine that may also possess the slight odor of ammonia. Most of the ammonia produced from protein breakdown is converted into urea by the liver, so ammonia is rarely detected in fresh urine. The strong ammonia odor you may detect in bathrooms or alleys is due to the breakdown of urea into ammonia by bacteria in the environment. About one in five people detect a distinctive odor in their urine after consuming asparagus; other foods such as onions, garlic, and fish can impart their own aromas! These food-caused odors are harmless.

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

His middle name was given after the South African city of Pretoria, where British troops were fighting the Boer War at the time of his birth. He was the eldest son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher, and the third of ten children overall. He had four brothers and five sisters. Context: Rugby football was the first sport Conacher played, and it was his favourite. He first played organized football at the age of 12 as a middle wing with the Capitals in the Toronto Rugby Football League. He played four seasons with the team between 1912 and 1915, during which the Capitals won the city championship each year. He won the Ontario championship as a junior with the Toronto Central YMCA in 1918, and in 1919 moved up to the intermediate level. With the intermediate Capitals, he was moved into an offensive role as a halfback. He excelled in the role, and his team reached Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) final. In that final, the Capitals' opponents from Sarnia made stopping Conacher their priority, a strategy that proved the difference as Sarnia won the championship. Conacher moved to the senior level in 1920 with the Toronto Rugby Club where his team again won the ORFU championship, but lost the eastern semifinal to the Toronto Argonauts of the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU). His play impressed the Argonauts, who signed him for the 1921 season. In his first game with the Argonauts, he scored 23 of the team's 27 points, and led the IRFU in scoring, accounting for 14 touchdowns and 90 of his team's 167 points as they went undefeated in six games. The Argonauts won the eastern championship, and faced the Edmonton Eskimos (renamed Edmonton 'Elks' in 1922) in the first east-west Grey Cup championship in Canadian history. Conacher rushed for 211 yards and scored 15 points in Toronto's 23-0 victory to claim the national title. Named captain in 1922, Conacher led the Argonauts to another undefeated season in IRFU play, finishing with five wins and one tie, as he rushed for about 950 yards. The Argonauts reached the Eastern final, but lost to Queen's University, 12-11. In that game, Conacher was the entire Argonaut offense rushing 35 times for 227 yards but Pep Leadley's 21 yard field goal towards the end of the game gave Queens' its victory.

Article: When travelers think of an Adriatic cruise, scenes of Venice, Italy--its canals, bridges, piazzas, and stunning architecture--come to mind. It's one of the most popular cruise destinations in Europe. And for many, the sail-away from Venice, through its Giudecca Canal, is an awe-inspiring experience. Venice may be known as La Serenissima, or \\"the most peaceful,\\" which, however, isn't entirely accurate these days. Venetians have been increasingly concerned about the impact of tourism and the potential for an environmental disaster off its shoreline due to the number of cruise ships that enter and exit its lagoon . That's why earlier last month, Venice announced a new policy to forbid the transit of cruise ships to the city via the Giudecca Canal. It's not that the city wants to shun the cruise industry altogether: It simply wants to force traffic further away from the landmarks along the shoreline. City officials say that most ships will now transit the Contorta Sant'Angelo Canal. Additionally, the city is _ the size of ships that can visit Venice, as well as the total number of ships that call on it on a daily basis. As of January 2014, Venice plans to reduce the visitations of larger ships (those that are 40,000 tons or heavier) by 20 percent. This effectively caps the number of ships that can enter per day to five. In November, ships heavier than 96,000 tons will not be allowed to enter Guidecca Canal at all. How the city plans to carry out the new five-ships-per-day rule remains to be seen and have yet to be announced. Which ships will be allowed passage? Will it be first-come, first-served? However they proceed, cruise line executives want their passengers to know that Venice will remain a regular port of call--even if the transit to and from the city must evolve. Question: The new policy was issued in order to _ . Answer: Answer:","output":"The new policy was issued in order to protect Venice's environment and historical landmarks from the negative impacts of mass tourism and potential environmental disasters associated with large cruise ships. By forbidding the transit of cruise ships through the Giudecca Canal, the city aims to direct the ship traffic further away from the shoreline and preserve its heritage. Additionally, the policy includes limiting the size of ships allowed to visit and reducing the number of daily ship visits to the city. This approach demonstrates the city's commitment to balancing the need for tourism revenue with the preservation of its unique environment and cultural heritage."},{"instruction":"In the 1979 -- 80 season, after having tested it in the previous pre-season, the NBA adopted the three-point line despite the view of many that it was a gimmick.

Philip hits a chip shot in front of his parents Betsy and Phil Lussier and his siblings, Amy and Mark, in their backyard. In medicine, it’s called the diagnostic odyssey: the difficult months and years that patients and families spend trying to figure out the cause of a baffling collection of symptoms. The National Institutes of Health announced Tuesday it will expand its efforts to solve such medical mysteries by creating a network of six centers, including one in Boston, that will each receive 7.2 million over the next four years. Advertisement The new Harvard Center for Integrated Approaches to Undiagnosed Diseases will combine the resources of Brigham and Women’s, Massachusetts General, and Boston Children’s hospitals. A coordinating center at Harvard Medical School will help route patients to centers across the country and facilitate the sharing of data among the programs. The project leaders hope to identify rare diseases that are currently unknown and develop treatments -- and gain insights that might apply to illnesses affecting many more people.

Sign up for more newsletters here “We should be able to generalize what we learn from this to more common diseases in this era of the hope for increasingly personalized and precision medicine,” said Dr. Joseph Loscalzo, chief of medicine at the Brigham. The network is an expansion of a pilot Undiagnosed Diseases Program the NIH launched in 2008 at its Bethesda, Md., campus. Over the past six years, the NIH has been able to study only about 600 of the more than 3,000 children and adults who applied to the program. The Boston center will use techniques that include DNA sequencing and analysis of the microbes present on patients’ skin or in their digestive tracts to discern the root of illnesses of a dozen patients in its first year. The hope is that newer technology, including the ability to search for networks of genes working in concert to cause disease, will improve the odds of finding the cause of a rare disease, which are currently around 25 percent. Advertisement The effort to understand rare, mysterious diseases is nothing new in Boston, where researchers have identified the causes of inherited hearing loss, muscle-weakening disease, and seizures. But Loscalzo said the new center will consolidate those kinds of efforts across institutions and help formalize the process for using cutting-edge technologies to understand patients’ illnesses. The coordination with other centers across the country could help doctors see patterns that would be hard to detect in a single ill patient and strengthen their confidence that a specific gene mutation is connected to a condition. The other centers will be located at Baylor College of Medicine, Duke University, Stanford University, the University of California, Los Angeles, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Undiagnosed diseases can take a huge financial and psychological toll on families. Patients often visit many clinics in search of a diagnosis, and having one can be important not only for finding the best treatment, but also for peace of mind and genetic counseling of other family members. “We should not underestimate the value of carrying a diagnosis, because individuals who lack a diagnosis are actually a little suspect in terms of their complaints -- not being trusted by family, friends, employers, and even their doctors,” said Dr. William Gahl, clinical director of the NIH-based Undiagnosed Diseases Program. “If we can take away that element of desperation and have some diagnosis for them even though it’s a bad diagnosis, they’re incredibly grateful and it changes their lives and the lives of their families.” One of the families waiting on a diagnosis are the Lussiers of Milton. From the day Philip was born more than 30 years ago, Betsy and Phil Lussier helplessly watched him struggle with a condition no one could comprehend. Philip was born small and failed to grow -- when he turned one, he still weighed just nine pounds. He developed unexplained gastrointestinal problems, musculo-skeletal issues, and pain, and the Lussiers went to many genetics specialists in the search for a clue about what they were dealing with. As Philip underwent surgeries, went on morphine, and received an evolving series of possible diagnoses that all turned out to be wrong, the uncertainty about what to expect was tremendously difficult. At one point, Betsy joined a support group for parents of children with muscular dystrophy, because it was one of the diagnoses Philip received. Despite the fact that it turned out to be the wrong diagnosis, she stayed in the group for 15 years. “Living like that, not knowing tomorrow or where we were going down the road, it was so much harder than if we had some idea of what we’re dealing with,” Betsy Lussier said. As time went on, things gradually got easier -- Philip is happier today and in less pain. In April, they celebrated his 30th birthday, a day the Lussiers never expected to be able to share with their son. He lives independently with the help of an aide, attends a day program, and comes home to Milton to spend the weekends, amusing his family with his sense of humor and a love of US history and sports. In 2012, the Lussiers made a trip to the undiagnosed diseases program at the NIH to see if the latest genomic analysis could finally reveal what caused Philip’s condition. They aren’t holding their breath for a miracle treatment; instead, the information might help his younger siblings when they think about starting their own families. “It would just be helpful to know if there is something genetic, because it’s a hard life Philip has lived,” Lussier said. “I would choose to have him here with us; he’s taught everybody else so much.” ||||| NIH names new clinical sites in Undiagnosed Diseases Network Four-year, 43 million initiative engages broad expertise in study of mystery conditions The National Institutes of Health has awarded grants to six medical centers around the country to select from the most difficult-to-solve medical cases and together develop effective approaches to diagnose them. The clinical sites will conduct clinical evaluation and scientific investigation in cases that involve patients with prolonged undiagnosed conditions. Each clinical site will contribute local medical expertise to the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). The network includes and is modeled after an NIH pilot program that has enrolled people with intractable medical conditions from nearly every state, the District of Columbia and seven foreign countries. The network builds on a program at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md., that for the past six years has evaluated hundreds of patients and provided many diagnoses, often using genomic approaches, for rare conditions. “Newly developed methods for genome sequencing now provide us amazingly powerful approaches for deciphering the causes of rare undiagnosed conditions,” said Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Human Genome Research Institute. “Along with robust clinical evaluations, genomics will play a central role in the UDN’s mission.” Dr. Green and Story Landis, Ph.D., director of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, co-chair the UDN working group. Undiagnosed diseases are conditions that even skilled physicians cannot diagnose despite extensive clinical investigation. They may not be recognized by doctors because they are rarely seen, are previously undescribed, or are rare forms of more common diseases. The NIH Common Fund awarded four-year grants of approximately 7.2 million (pending available funds) to each of the six medical centers around the country. James M. Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the NIH Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI), announced in an NIH telebriefing that the six newly awarded sites join a clinical site already established at NIH in pursuing cutting-edge diagnoses. In addition, this past December, NIH selected Harvard Medical School as the UDN Coordinating Center for the multi-institution network. “The NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Network has the potential to transform medicine and serve as a catalyst for new discoveries,” said Dr. Anderson. “It is an ideal NIH Common Fund program—the only one focused on diagnoses of rare disorders.” The following institutions were awarded grants to establish UDN clinical sites: Baylor College of Medicine, Houston; Principal Investigator: Brendan H.L. Lee, M.D., Ph.D. Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston; Principal Investigator: Joseph Loscalzo, M.D., Ph.D. Duke University, Durham, North Carolina; Principal Investigators: Vandana Shashi, M.D. , and David B. Goldstein, Ph.D. Stanford University, Stanford, California; Principal Investigators: Euan A. Ashley, M.D., D.Phil., Jonathan Bernstein, M.D., Ph.D., and Paul Graham Fisher, M.D. University of California, Los Angeles; Principal Investigators: Eric J. Vilain, M.D., Ph.D., Katrina M. Dipple, M.D., Ph.D., Stanley Nelson, M.D., and Christina Palmer, C.G.C., Ph.D. Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville; Principal Investigators: John A. Phillips, III, M.D., and John H. Newman, M.D. “This type of program can invigorate a medical center anywhere in the country and in the world,” said William A. Gahl, M.D., Ph.D., clinical director at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), director of the NIH-based Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) and co-coordinator of the UDN working group. “Often, patients have a lot of physical complaints and no objective diagnoses. Our goal is to use the latest tools to make a diagnosis that spans the clinical, pathological and biochemical spectrum to uncover the basic genetic defect.” Since 2008, the UDP has explored this fascinating area of medical research and acquired practical insights in the process of enrolling approximately 600 undiagnosed children and adults in its clinical protocols. The multidisciplinary clinical and research team diagnosed approximately 100 patients (20-25 percent of those evaluated), discovered two unknown diseases and identified 15 genes not previously associated with any other human disease. A combination of genomic and clinical analyses contributed to the diagnoses. By including an additional six clinical sites, the NIH UDN will both draw upon the unique expertise of new clinical research groups and cultivate opportunities for collaboration among a larger group of expert laboratory and clinical investigators. Physicians within the network will collect and share high-quality clinical and laboratory data, including genomic information, clinical observations and documentation of environmental exposures. They also will benefit from common protocols designed to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases. “The UDN will look at diseases across all clinical specialties using new tools and methods of analysis for the identification of new diseases,” said Anastasia L. Wise, Ph.D., a program director in NHGRI's Division of Genomic Medicine and co-coordinator of the UDN working group that oversees the development and implementation of the UDN. “The network will facilitate collaboration and shared use of genomic tools among the sites.” Based on the NIH UDP experience, the UDN Coordinating Center at Harvard Medical School has begun paving the way for the new UDN clinical sites to begin accepting patients. Among the coordinating efforts are the preparation of draft protocols and operating guidelines, and the definition of an initial framework of common practices across the network. The network will share systems for data collection and develop common approaches to patient selection, evaluation and diagnosis. Each new clinical site may have variations in handling health insurance coverage for clinical testing and care. However, no patient will be turned away from participation in the UDN based on lack of health insurance coverage. “We believe that there is a substantial unmet demand for the diagnoses of conditions that have perplexed skillful physicians,” said Isaac Kohane, M.D., Ph.D., professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital and principal investigator of the Coordinating Center. “We want to address inquiries from physicians and patients throughout the country who require these services and, in doing so, create a 21st century model for diagnosis and treatment in this genomic and information-intensive era.” UDN investigators will share genomic data from UDN patients with the research community through multiple public repositories. Network-wide data sharing will observe standards of patient privacy, confidentiality and management of health information. The network will start up and test its operating procedures during its first year. It will progressively expand recruitment of patients so that by the summer of 2017, the rate of admissions at each new clinical site will be about 50 patients per year. For a period this summer, referrals from clinicians on behalf of undiagnosed patients may continue to be made through the existing NIH application pipeline.

NIH...Turning Discovery Into Health® ||||| They baffle even the finest specialists: rare diseases that affect only a handful of people and that are often caused by extremely rare genetic mutations. Now the National Institutes of Health is setting up a network of research centers where doctors will examine these unlucky patients, test their genetic codes and swap information on what they find. The hope is that by pooling information and patients, doctors can solve these medical mysteries and perhaps also shed light on more common diseases. “The Undiagnosed Diseases Network that we are announcing today will focus on the rarest of disorders — often those that affect fewer than 50 people in the entire world,” said Dr. Eric Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, one of the NIH institutes. “They are so rare that they may never have been discovered or doctors may never have encountered them.” Sign up for top Health news direct to your inbox. \\"They sent us through ever doctor imaginable.\\" One of the patients who finally got a diagnosis is Louise Benge, 59, from Brodhead, Kentucky. She’s been suffering odd pain since she was 16. “By the time I was in my 20s, the pain in my legs was so bad I had trouble sleeping and lots of trouble walking,” Benge told reporters. Her brothers and sister shared the mysterious affliction. Not only did Benge go to her primary care physician, but she beat paths to the doors of vascular specialists, neurologists and other specialists, too. Then she got into NIH’s early Undiagnosed Diseases Program. “At NIH they sent us through every doctor imaginable,” Benge said. They had CT scans, MRIs, genetic tests and electrocardiograms. Finally, genetic testing showed Benge and her siblings had ACDC, a rare calcification disorder. It causes calcium to build up in the blood vessels of her hands, legs and feet but, luckily, not to the heart. Eventually the calcium completely blocks blood flow, causing pain and forcing the body to grow new vessels to bypass the blockage. Benge and her family members are taking a drug called a bisphosphonate, usually used to treat osteoporosis or brittle bone disease. The hope is it can stop or even reverse the calcium buildup. Louise Benge, 56, Brodhead , Ky., is a patient in the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program on Jan. 31, 2011. Jeannine Mjoseth / National Human Genome Research Institute But even if it doesn’t help, Benge may already have benefited, says Dr. William Gahl, who directs NIH’s Undiagnosed Diseases Program. “We should not underestimate the value of hearing a diagnosis,” Gahl said. People with rare diseases have often lived under a veil of suspicion from loved ones, employers and sometimes even their doctors. “How difficult it is to go through life with that element of desperation,’ he said. “Even though it’s a bad diagnosis, they are incredibly grateful and it changes their lives and the lives of their families. Cures and treatments are one thing but changing quality of life is another thing that this program has offered to a number of people.” Rare diseases may each only affect a few people, but collectively they affect about 10 percent of the population, said Dr. James Anderson, director of program coordination at NIH.

Individually, these may be rare conditions, but nearly 30 million Americans— almost one in 10 people—are dealing with the effects of such a condition.” Genome sequencing technology has finally made it possible to find out what’s causing many of these conditions, said Green. “Newly developed methods for genome sequencing now provide us amazingly powerful approaches for deciphering the causes of rare undiagnosed conditions,” he said. “To date, researchers have discovered the genomic bases of more than 5,000 rare genetic disorders, but we are still on the hunt for the cause of an additional 2,000-3,000 single-gene, also called Mendelian, disorders.” What the NIH announced Tuesday is a four-year, 43 million program. Six centers have been given four-year grants of about 7 million each: Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital Duke University, Durham, North Carolina Stanford University, California University of California, Los Angeles Vanderbilt University Medical Center The coordinating center is at Harvard Medical School in Boston. The NIH hopes that each center will be seeing 50 patients a year by 2017. “If we find a second patient with that same variant then that pretty much nails it.\\" Up to now, all patients have had to be seen at NIH’s clinical center in Bethesda, Maryland. Even so, the interest has been overwhelming. “We have had about 10,000 inquiries,” Gahl said. About a third have completed applications to go through the program, which is free of charge. NIH has accepted just 750. Getting into the program doesn’t guarantee a diagnosis, much less a potential treatment. “We think we have got a decent diagnosis in about a quarter to 40 percent or so. It’s rough,” Gahl said. But the hope is that getting more people into the program will help. “Patients have many mutations and not clear often which one is causing the symptoms,” Gahl said. “If we find a second patient with that same variant then that pretty much nails it.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has created a network of six centers, called the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, to help diagnose and treat patients with rare and undiagnosed diseases.

To better understand this position, let us analyse both the premise and the hypothesis more thoroughly. The premise states: In the eastern part of the country, states realized that emissions from sources in other states were significantly contributing to their 1-hour ozone non-attainment problems. The hypothesis states: This has happened in the western part of the country when states realised emissions from other sources were negligible. To evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, it is essential to examine the potential connections and discrepancies. Similarities: 1. Both the premise and the hypothesis involve a realisation or recognition by the given states concerning emissions affecting their ozone non-attainment problems. 2. The geographical context indicates the potential for differences in emissions contributions based on location, with the eastern part of the country experiencing significant impacts from other states, and the western part of the country potentially seeing negligible effects. Discrepancies: 1. The premise focuses on a situation where emissions from other states are making a substantial impact on ozone non-attainment problems. In contrast, the hypothesis is discussing a scenario where emissions from other sources are considered negligible. 2. While the premise highlights the eastern part of the country, the hypothesis features the western part. The spatial distinction may lead to differences in population, industrial structures, meteorological patterns, and transportation networks, all of which can influence the emissions contributions and their impact on ozone levels. These factors complicate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, making it inappropriate to directly connect the two. To conclude, given the similarities and discrepancies between the premise and the hypothesis, it is not possible to assert that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The geographical context, differences in emissions impact, and other regional factors create a complex situation that prevents drawing a direct correlation between the conditions in the eastern and western parts of the country. To make a more accurate conclusion, additional evidence and a deeper analysis of the underlying factors affecting emissions contributions and ozone non-attainment issues across the country would be necessary."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"The hotel offers spacious rooms covered by wireless Internet access included in the price.\\" to Spanish.","output":"El hotel ofrece habitaciones amplias cubiertas por acceso a Internet inalámbrico incluido en el precio."},{"instruction":"Make use of the article to answer the questions.

Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

Pilar Abel, 58, claims her mother and the artist met in the 1950s when her mother was working for a family that would often spend summers in Cadaqués, close to where Dalí had a home. The pair “had a friendship that developed into clandestine love”, said Abel, in documents presented to a Madrid court. Abel was born in 1956. At the time, Dalí would have been married to Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova. They married in 1934 and had no children. Driven by her mother’s repeated comments that she was the daughter of Dalí, Abel took a DNA test in Madrid in 2007, using hair and skin remains that she had obtained from a death mask of the painter. The results were inconclusive. She then turned to Dalí’s close friend and official biographer, Robert Descharnes. It was agreed that further DNA testing would be carried out in Paris using medical samples that had belonged to Dalí. Abel said she never received the results of the test. On Thursday, she took her battle to a Madrid court, asking for help in obtaining the results or, if necessary, backing to have another DNA test carried out. If there is insufficient genetic material for the test, the court documents raise the possibility of exhuming Dalí’s remains. Abel’s legal challenge is filed against the heirs of the painter, specifically Spain’s tax office and public administration, as well as the Dalí Foundation. In 2008, Descharnes’ son Nicolas refuted Abel’s paternity claim, saying the doctor who had carried out the paternity tests in Paris had verbally communicated to Abel that the tests were negative. “There is no relationship between this woman and Salvador Dalí,” he told Spanish agency Efe at the time. ||||| A judge has ordered the exhumation of Salvador Dali's body for a biological test to determine the paternity of Maria Pilar Abel Martinez, 61, who claims to be his daughter.

I also call her Lionette, because when she gets angry she roars like the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lion\\" Gala (Kazan, Russia, 1894 - Portlligat, Girona, 1982) Salvador Dalí's wife and muse, whose real name was Elena Ivanovna Diakonova was a mysterious and highly intuitive woman, which was able to recognise artistic and creative genius when she saw it, and had relations with a number of intellectuals and artists. Nevertheless, the truth iss that very little is known about herpersonality: she had two older brothers, Vadim and Nicolai, a younger sister, Lidia; she spent her childhood in Moscowand her father died when she was eleven years old. Her mother remarried later to a lawyer, with whom Gala related very well and thanks to whom she managed to acquire a good education. She was a brilliant student, completing her studies at the M.G. Brukhonenko academy for young ladies with a very high average mark; a degree from the tsar authorised her to become a primary school teacher and to give lessons in people's homes. In 1912 she suffered a worsening of the tuberculosis that had afflicted her for some time, and her family decided to move her intothe Clavadel sanatorium in Switzerland, where she met Eugène Grindel (later to be known as Paul Eluard). Their similar ages and love for reading made them become good friends. Both were discharged from the sanatorium in 1914.Gala returned to Russia and Eluard went to the war front, but the couple proposed to each other before that. They married in 1917, and the following year was born the girl that was to be Gala's only daughter, Cécile. Eluard, who had already been revealed as poet and had changed his surname, had close relationships with the leading figures of the surrealist movementand in particularl with the creators of the Littérature magazine: André Breton, Philippe Soupault and Louis Aragon. Gala also attended some of their meetings. In 1922 she started a relationship with Max Ernst but they broke up in 1924. Max Ernst painted her in a number of portraits. Also noteworthy was her friendship with the poet René Char, and particularly with René Crevel. It was in 1929 when she first met Salvador Dalí. In April of that year Dalí went to Paris to present the film that he had created with Luis Buñuel, Un chien andalou, and it was there where Camille Goemans, a Belgian poet and gallery owner, introduced Dalí to Paul Eluard. Dalí invited them to spend the summer in Cadaqués. Goemans and a friend of his, as well as René Magritte and his wife, and Luis Buñuel, Paul Eluard and Gala, and the couple's daughter Cécile, all spent some time there. When the painter met Gala it was love at first sight. In his Secret Life, he wrote: \\"She was destined to be my Gradiva (the name comes from the title of a novel by W. Jensen, the main character of which was Sigmund Freud; Gradiva was the book's heroine and it was her who brought psychological healing to the main character), the one who moves forward, my victory, my wife\\". And Gala was indeed to remain forever at the painter's side, so that from that time on her biography was linked with that of Dalí. In 1948, Dalí and Gala returned from the United States after eight years of exile there. Dalí had achieved recognition in his own country, and his father had come to accept his son's relationship with a divorced Russian woman. From that time onwards, the Dalís would spend the spring and summer in Portlligat and the autumn and winter between New York and Paris. In 1958 Dalí and Gala got married at the Àngels chapel, near Girona. In 1968 the painter bought Gala a castle in Púbol, Girona, and it was agreed that the painter could not go there without her prior permission . Between 1971 and 1980, Gala would spend some time at her castle, always during summer. It was there that Gala was buried, after she died in 1982. Since 1996 the castle has been open to the public as the Gala-Dalí Castle House Museum in Púbol. ||||| GIRONA, Spain — Salvador Dalí led the kind of eccentric and sensational lifestyle that might have been expected of one of the greatest Surrealist painters. A quarter century after Dalí’s death, however, Pilar Abel, a tarot card reader, is determined to add another twist to Dalí’s story. She wants a court to recognize her as his daughter — and perhaps grant her a share of the hundreds of millions of euros worth of paintings Dalí bequeathed to the Spanish state upon his death in 1989. According to Ms. Abel’s paternity lawsuit, filed in a Madrid court in March, her mother had a “clandestine love affair” with the painter in the 1950s in Port Lligat, the fishing village where Dalí and his Russian-born wife, Gala, built their waterfront house. Ms. Abel’s mother, Antonia Martínez de Haro, spent several summers in the village, working mostly as a nanny for families living near Dalí’s home. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Dalí died in Spain in 1989 and had no children with his wife A judge in Madrid has ordered the exhumation of the body of Spanish artist Salvador Dalí to get samples for a paternity suit. A Spanish woman, born in 1956, said her mother, a maid, had a clandestine affair with the painter in 1955. The judge said there were no biological remains or personal objects of the artist to be used in the test. He died in Spain in 1989 at the age of 85. The Dalí Foundation, which manages the artist's estate, says it will appeal. The surrealist painter was buried in the theatre and museum he designed himself, in his home town of Figueres in the north-eastern Catalonia region. Maria Pilar Abel Martínez, a tarot card reader who was born in Girona, made the paternity claim for the first time in 2015. Image copyright AFP/EPA Image caption Ms Martínez claims that her mother had an affair with the world-famous painter She said her mother, Antonia, had worked for a family that spent time in Cadaqués, next to where the painter had a home. Antonia left her job in 1955, moved to a different city and married another man. Ms Martínez claimed that her mother told her several times that Dalí was her father, on many occasions in front of others. \\"The only thing I'm missing is a moustache,\\" she once said, according to newspaper El Mundo (in Spanish). At the time of the alleged affair, Dalí was married to his muse Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova. The couple had no children. Image caption Salvador Dalí is best known for his surrealist works The decision also cites that Ms Martínez underwent two paternity tests, both in 2007, but never received the results. Her legal action is against the Spanish state, to which Dalí left his estate. If she is confirmed to be the artist's daughter, she could use his surname and be entitled to part of his estate - but Spanish media say she would have to legally request it. Ms Martínez's lawyer said there was no date for the exhumation, but that it could happen as soon as July. The Dalí Foundation said in a statement that an appeal would \\"be lodged in the coming days.\\" Other notable exhumations Richard III: When a skeleton was found underneath a Leicester car park in 2012, archaeologists hoped they may have found the last Plantagenet king.

No casualties were immediately reported from the exchange of fire that took place across one of the world’s most heavily armed borders on Thursday. But tensions remained high on Friday, as Mr. Kim ordered his front-line units to be prepared to attack South Korean loudspeakers along the border unless they stopped blaring propaganda broadcasts by Saturday evening. South Korea, currently in the middle of large-scale joint military exercises with the United States, rejected the North Korean demand. Instead it stepped up its own military vigilance, vowing to retaliate against any provocations from the North. Mr. Kim ordered all front-line units to go on a “semi-war state,” one of his country’s highest military alerts, from 5 p.m. Friday during an emergency meeting of his Central Military Commission, the north’s official Korean Central News Agency said on Friday. ||||| SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's military fired dozens of shells Thursday at rival North Korea after the North lobbed a single artillery round at a South Korean border town, the South's Defense Ministry said. The ministry said in a statement that its artillery landed at the place where North Korea had fired its shell. There were no other immediate details from the military, but it appeared that North Korea did not respond to South Korea's returned fire. About 80 residents in the South Korean town where the shell fell, Yeoncheon, were evacuated to underground bunkers, and authorities urged other residents to evacuate, a Yeoncheon official said, requesting anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media. He said there were no reports of injuries or damage in Yeoncheon. In the nearby border city of Paju, residents were asked to stay home, officials said. North Korea had previously threatened to attack South Korean loudspeakers that have been broadcasting, for the first time in 11 years, anti-Pyongyang propaganda messages across their shared border. Pyongyang also restarted its own loudspeakers aimed at the South. The cross-border propaganda warfare followed accusations from Seoul that Pyongyang had planted land mines on the South Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone that maimed two South Korean soldiers last week. Authoritarian North Korea is extremely sensitive to any criticism of the government run by leader Kim Jong Un, whose family has ruled since it was founded in 1948. North Korea's army said previously in a statement that the broadcasts were a declaration of war and that if they were not immediately stopped \\"an all-out military action of justice\\" would ensue. South Korean President Park Geun-hye urged Pyongyang to \\"wake up\\" from the delusion that it could maintain its government with provocation and threats. Pyongyang's powerful National Defense Commission had claimed that Seoul fabricated the evidence on the land mines and demanded video proof. The land mine explosions resulted in one soldier losing both legs and another soldier one leg. ||||| (CNN) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered front-line military units to enter \\"a wartime state\\" after an exchange of fire with South Korea, his country's state-run Korean Central News Agency reported Friday. The announcement, employing bellicose language typical of North Korea , adds to the edgy situation in the region. The two sides traded artillery fire over their heavily fortified border on Thursday afternoon, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. Two shells came from the North Korean side, the ministry said, and South Korea fired dozens of shells in response. No casualties were reported from the exchange of fire. North Korea hasn't given a detailed account of events, but the KCNA report Friday accused South Korea of committing a \\"military provocation.\\" Kim presided over an emergency meeting of the North's Central Military Commission late Thursday, issuing an order that the army's \\"front-line large combined units\\" should \\"enter a wartime state to be fully battle ready to launch surprise operations,\\" KCNA said. He also ordered that \\"the area along the front be put in a semi-war state,\\" according to the report. The measures are to take effect from 5 p.m. Friday local time. Theatrical conflict? It's hardly the first time North Korea has used such alarming language. During a period of heightened tensions in the region in 2013, North Korea announced it had entered \\"a state of war\\" with South Korea. That situation didn't result in military clashes.

Hide Caption 55 of 55 Jamie Metzl, an Asia expert for the Atlantic Council in New York, said he thought it was unlikely that the current crisis would escalate further. \\"North Korea has more to gain from conflict theater than from a conflict that would quickly expose its fundamental weakness,\\" he said. South Korea, a key U.S. ally where roughly 28,000 American troops are based, said it's on high alert after the exchange of fire. The Pentagon is also monitoring the situation closely, said Cmdr. William Urban, a Defense Department spokesman. Tensions spiked on the Korean Peninsula after two South Korean soldiers were seriously wounded by landmines on August 4 in the demilitarized zone that separates the two countries. South Korea has accused the North of deliberately planting the mines, an allegation that Pyongyang denies. North Korean threats over loudspeakers Seoul vowed a \\"harsh\\" response to the landmines and resumed blaring propaganda messages over the border from huge loudspeakers last week. The move infuriated North Korea, which called the broadcasting \\"a direct action of declaring a war.\\" Over the weekend, it threatened to blow up the South Korean speakers and also warned of \\"indiscriminate strikes.\\" A U.S. official told CNN that the United States believes that North Korea fired at a South Korean loudspeaker on Thursday. South Korea said that North Korea sent a written message around 5 p.m. Thursday local time threatening military action if Seoul doesn't stop the propaganda broadcasts within 48 hours and remove the loudspeakers. A South Korean Defense Ministry official warned Friday that Seoul would retaliate strongly to any additional North Korean provocations. On Monday, North Korea pumped its own propaganda broadcasts over the border , the same day South Korea started military exercises with the United States and other countries. Pyongyang says it views the drills as a prelude to an invasion. The North Korean government asked this week that the exercises, which it described as \\"serious provocations\\" be placed on the U.N. Security Council's agenda. Pyongyang has made similar requests before without success. A history of clashes While the current tensions on the Korean Peninsula are unsettling, they're not without precedent. In November 2010, North Korea shelled an island near the countries' disputed maritime border, killing two South Korean marines. The two sides also traded fire in October 2014. A clash took place between patrol boats in the Yellow Sea, and then another flared days later over land after North Korean gunners apparently targeted balloons carrying leaflets critical of the country's reclusive regime. Over the past six decades, skirmishes have flared repeatedly along land and sea borders as each state aims to reunify the peninsula according to its own terms and system of government. Deadly naval clashes occurred along the demarcation line in 1999, 2002 and 2009. Following Japan's defeat in World War II, Korea became a divided nation -- the capitalist South supported by the United States and its Western allies, and the communist North an ally of the Soviet Union. Cold War tensions erupted into war in 1950, devastating the peninsula and taking the lives of as many as 2 million people. The fighting ended in 1953 with a truce, not a treaty, and settled little. Technically, the two Koreas are still at war. Besides the border skirmishes, other incidents have proved provocative. In 1968, North Korea dispatched commandos in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate South Korea's President. In 1983, a bombing linked to Pyongyang killed 17 high-level South Korean officials on a visit to Myanmar. In 1987, the North was accused of bombing a South Korean airliner. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"North Korea and South Korea have had a big disagreement and have been angry at each other.

In the first quarter, Tampa Bay trailed as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 39-yard TD pass to WR David Patten. The Bucs would respond with CB Phillip Buchanon returning an interception 26 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Tampa Bay took the lead with kicker Matt Bryant getting a 37-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New Orleans would reply with kicker Mart&#237;n Gram&#225;tica getting a 34-yard field goal, yet the Buccaneers replied with Bryant nailing a 33-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Saints got their lead back with Brees completing an 84-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson. In the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay would go ahead again as QB Jeff Garcia completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR Ike Hilliard. However, New Orleans regained the lead after Brees completing a 42-yard TD pass to RB Reggie Bush. Inside the final minute, Garcia drove the Buccaneers to the Saints 24-yard line.

Answer:","output":"The two players who scored the longest touchdowns of the game were David Patten and Devery Henderson, both from the New Orleans Saints. While verifying this information, these were the steps I followed: 1. First, I went through the text to locate instances where touchdowns were mentioned. 2. I spotted that Drew Brees completed a 39-yard TD pass to WR David Patten in the first quarter. 3. Then I noticed Drew Brees completed an 84-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson in the third quarter. 4. I realized that Brees also completed a 42-yard TD pass to RB Reggie Bush in the fourth quarter. 5. Comparing these, it's clear that the 84-yard and 39-yard touchdowns were the longest. Hence, David and Devery were the two players who scored the longest touchdowns of the game. The 42-yard touchdown by Reggie Bush in the fourth quarter came in third and wasn't one of the two longest touchdowns of the game."},{"instruction":"Q: Skylar made their mom happy by cleaning up after dinner. Given the question \\"How would their dad feel as a result?\\", is \\"embarrased\\" a valid answer?

However, we can infer that as a part of the family, Skylar's dad may likely appreciate the help and feel happy that Skylar contributed positively to the family. 4. If we take into account possible cultural, social, or family dynamics, it's possible that some people might feel embarrassed for not being the one to help or for their child taking the initiative instead. Given these considerations, \\"embarrassed\\" could potentially be a valid answer but it would rely on assumptions about the dad's expectations and family dynamics.

It is not possible to tell Based on the premise provided, the rule seems to deal with an alternative procedure for handling mortgage payments when there is an arrearage, but we cannot definitively conclude that the rule changes how mortgages are paid in general. It is important to consider the context in which the rule is being applied and the specific alternative procedures mentioned. The premise mentions that there is a recompense provided to mortgagees for using these alternative procedures. This implies that when the mortgagees choose to utilize these alternative procedures, they are compensated, potentially making it more beneficial for the mortgagees to consider these options when faced with arrearages. However, the premise doesn't clarify whether these alternative procedures are optional or mandatory, or detail the extent to which these alternative procedures will be applied or how they affect the overall mortgage payment structure. Additionally, the partial claim payment to the mortgagee, which is applied to the arrearage, is an important element in the premise. This suggests that the mortgagee may receive some form of financial assistance in repaying the mortgage arrearage. However, it is unclear if this has a direct impact on how the mortgages are paid in general or if it only affects the way the mortgagees handle the arrearage, which represents only a portion of the overall mortgage payment process. In summary, based on the limited information given in the premise, it is not possible to definitively confirm the hypothesis that the rule changes how mortgages are paid.

A brief sentence, by definition, should be concise, informative, and meaningful, successfully conveying a particular idea or impression without relying on an extensive vocabulary or lengthy exposition. To effectively construct a brief sentence, one must first determine the core message or theme that the sentence is meant to express. This could vary from providing a simple fact or observation, to conveying a specific emotion or viewpoint. Once the central concept has been identified, it is essential to choose the most appropriate and precise words to convey this idea clearly and efficiently, without unnecessary embellishments or redundancies. In addition to the choice of words, attention must also be given to the grammatical structure and overall coherence of the sentence. A well-crafted brief sentence should follow proper grammar rules to ensure that the intended meaning is not lost or misinterpreted due to syntactical inconsistencies or irregularities. Moreover, the sentence should be structured in a logical and easily comprehensible manner, so that readers or listeners can effortlessly grasp the conveyed message. Another crucial aspect to consider when composing a brief sentence is the tone and style, which should be tailored according to the intended audience and purpose. A formal or professional setting might demand more sophisticated language and restrained phrasing, while an informal or casual context may allow for a more relaxed and colloquial expression. Furthermore, a brief sentence can possess various layers of meaning, depending on the intricacies of language, cultural context, and the associations evoked by specific words or phrases. An author might intentionally employ puns, double entendres, or other linguistic devices to imbue the sentence with additional depth or complexity, thereby increasing the scope for interpretation and analysis. Taking all these factors into account, let's craft a brief sentence that encapsulates these principles: \\"Her smile brightened the room, a silent testament to her prevailing joy.\\" This sentence is concise, uses precise language and proper grammar, and conveys both a simple observation and a deeper insight into the subject's emotional state. In summary, while a brief sentence is, by design, short and to the point, creating an effective and impactful one requires careful consideration of various elements such as central message, word choice, grammar, tone, style, audience, and potential layers of meaning. By striking a balance among these factors, a brief sentence can successfully encapsulate a thought or idea in a clear and memorable manner."},{"instruction":"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: There are several different types of mutual funds available, each of which has a different level of risk. Even if you are a relatively conservative investor, you still may want to add one or two higher-risk funds. A diversified basket of mutual funds that meets your overall preferred level of risk allows your portfolio to experience some growth rather than merely preserving your capital. Within your overall investment account, you want to reserve at least 5 percent of your assets in cash so you can take advantage of opportunities as they arise. Money market funds generally have the lowest risk level. Stock funds and bond funds are generally higher risk funds. Target date funds carry a mix of investments and are best if you have a specific retirement date in mind. Before you start buying shares in mutual funds, you need a good understanding of the types of funds available, the possible returns associated with those funds, and the expenses involved. You can learn a lot about mutual funds by reading on the internet, especially at the website of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates mutual funds. You also can download a complete consumer guide to mutual funds at https://investor.gov, which will walk you through all the details of the market generally and provide guidance on investing wisely. Online ratings services, such as Lipper or Morningstar, offer risk assessments for each mutual fund. Compare these to the risk tolerance you've established to decide which mutual fund is right for you. These services also detail all fees and charges related to each mutual fund. These expenses can eat into your returns significantly, so you need to research each fund carefully before you commit any money. Look beyond the name of a fund. Just because a fund carries the name of a particular bank may not mean that bank still runs that fund. A fund called a \\"stock fund\\" may carry other investments besides corporate stock. While investing in an actively-managed fund will give you more flexibility, you likely will pay higher fees to an investment manager. Passive investment in index-based funds may be a better option for you if you are new to investing. Index-based funds typically have lower fees than actively-managed funds, but they also run the risk of underperforming once you take fees and taxes into account. Generally, investing in mutual funds will be more satisfying if you plan to hold your shares for five years or longer. The longer you hold your shares, the better your chance of a decent investment return. Some funds offer several different share classes, typically A, B, and C classes. Each class has a different fee structure. The length of time you plan to hold your shares can help you determine which share class is most appropriate for you.","output":"This article discusses the various types of mutual funds, their risk levels, and strategies for diversifying investments while providing resources to help investors understand and choose the right mutual fund based on their risk tolerance and investment goals."},{"instruction":"- birth name is edwin field - birth date is 16 december 1871 - ru amateuryears is 1883 1893 -- 1894 1895 -- ? -- ? 1891 -- 1894 ? - ? - ru amateurclubs is clifton richmond rfc cambridge university r.u.f.c. middlesex wanderers barbarian f.c. - ru nationalpoints is -lrb- 0 -rrb- - death date is 9 january 1947 - spouse is florence sophia plowright field - ru nationalcaps is 2 - university is trinity college , cambridge - school is clifton college - death place is bromley , england - birth place is hampstead , england - ru position is fullback - ru nationalteam is eng - ru nationalyears is 1893 - occupation is solicitor - children is douglas , mary and humphrey oliver Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.","output":"Based on the provided information, this could be about Edwin Temple Gurdon, an English rugby union player who played as a fullback for various clubs and the national team.

A linguistically acceptable sentence adheres to the rules of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics within a particular language. Here's a short sentence: \\"The cat sleeps.\\" This sentence follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) structure commonly used in the English language. The statement is concise, clear, and follows the rules of grammar, while conveying a simple idea. However, as an AI, I can provide a detailed explanation of what constitutes a linguistically acceptable sentence. Several factors contribute to the linguistic acceptability of a sentence: 1. Syntax: Syntactic acceptability refers to the way words are ordered and combined to form sentences. A syntactically correct sentence follows the grammatical rules and structure of a language. In English, a basic sentence usually has a subject, verb, and, if needed, an object. Other parts of the sentence, such as adjectives and adverbs, depend on the language's specific rules. 2. Semantics: Semantically acceptable sentences have meanings that are logically sound and make sense within the context of the language. Semantics deals with the meanings derived from words in relation to each other, and how they come together to form a coherent idea. A semantically acceptable sentence is one where the intended meaning is clear and the combination of words is meaningful. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatic acceptability refers to the appropriateness of a sentence considering the context in which it is used. A pragmatically acceptable sentence conveys the intended meaning while also being socially and contextually appropriate. It takes into account the listener's perspective and the goals of communication to determine what is most effective. 4. Morphology: Morphologically acceptable sentences use the correct forms of words according to the language's rules. Morphology deals with the structure of words, including the use of prefixes, suffixes, and inflections. A morphologically acceptable sentence will be one in which the words are correctly formed and spelled. 5. Phonology: Phonologically acceptable sentences adhere to the sound patterns and rules of a language, which deals with the organization and distribution of speech sounds. Proper pronunciation and stress patterns contribute to the overall linguistic acceptability of a sentence. Overall, a linguistically acceptable sentence is one that adheres to the grammatical, semantic, pragmatic, morphological, and phonological rules of the language in question.

It was part of Cádiz province until 14 March 1995 when the city's Statute of Autonomy was passed. - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - Celestial mechanics is the branch of astronomy that deals with the motions of celestial objects. Historically, celestial mechanics applies principles of physics (classical mechanics) to astronomical objects, such as stars and planets, to produce ephemeris data. As an astronomical field of study, celestial mechanics includes the sub-fields of Orbital mechanics (astrodynamics), which deals with the orbit of an artificial satellite, and Lunar theory, which deals with the orbit of the Moon. - Jurisprudence is the science, study, and theory of law. It includes principles behind law that make the law. Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as jurists or legal theorists (including legal philosophers and social theorists of law), hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, of legal reasoning, legal systems, and of legal institutions. Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems in two rough groups: - Melilla ( \\"Maliliyyah\\") is a Spanish autonomous city located on the north coast of Africa, sharing a border with Morocco with an area of . Melilla, along with Ceuta, is one of two permanently inhabited Spanish cities in mainland Africa.

Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos. - A (', , \\"doctrine\\"; pl. ') is a school of thought within \\"fiqh\\" (Islamic jurisprudence). In the first 150 years of Islam, there were numerous \\"madhahib\\", most of which have become extinct or merged with other schools. The Amman Message, which was endorsed in 2005 by prominent Islamic scholars around the world, recognized four Sunni schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali), two Shia schools (Ja'fari, Zaidi), the Ibadi school and the Zahiri school. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Scholasticism is a method of critical thought which dominated teaching by the academics (\\"scholastics,\\" or \\"schoolmen\\") of medieval universities in Europe from about 1100 to 1700, and a program of employing that method in articulating and defending dogma in an increasingly pluralistic context. It originated as an outgrowth of and a departure from Christian monastic schools at the earliest European universities. The first institutions in the West to be considered universities were established in Italy, France, Spain, and England in the late 11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology, such as Schola Medica Salernitana, the University of Bologna, and the University of Paris. It is difficult to define the date at which they became true universities, although the lists of studia generalia for higher education in Europe are a useful guide, held by the Catholic Church and its various religious orders. - Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. It has an area of and shares its northern border with Spain. The Rock of Gibraltar is the major landmark of the region.

The greater metropolitan area of Tunis, often referred to as \\"Grand Tunis\\", has some 2,700,000 inhabitants. - The Indo-European languages are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects. There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by \\"Ethnologue\\", with over two-thirds (313) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch. The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Persian and Punjabi, each with over 100 million speakers. Today, 46% of the human population speaks an Indo-European language natively, by far the highest of any language family. - The Moon orbits Earth in the prograde direction and completes one revolution relative to the stars in approximately 27.322 days (a sidereal month). Earth and the Moon orbit about their barycentre (common center of mass), which lies about from Earth's center (about of the radius of Earth). On average, the Moon is at a distance of about from Earth's centre, which corresponds to about 60 Earth radii. With a mean orbital velocity of , the Moon appears to move relative to the stars each hour by an amount roughly equal to its angular diameter, or by about half a degree. The Moon differs from most satellites of other planets in that its orbit is close to the plane of the ecliptic, and not to Earth's equatorial plane. The plane of the lunar orbit is inclined to the ecliptic by about 5°, whereas the Moon's equatorial plane is inclined by only 1.5° to the ecliptic. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - JURIST is an online legal news service hosted by the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, powered by a staff of more than 60 law students working in Pittsburgh and other US locations under the direction of founding Publisher & Editor-in-Chief Professor Bernard Hibbitts, Acting Executive Director Andrew Morgan, Research Director Jaclyn Belczyk, Technical Director Jeremiah Lee, Managing Editor Joseph Macklin and Chief of Staff Steven Wildberger.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Rabat ( ) is the capital of Morocco and its seventh largest city centre with an urban population of approximately 580,000 (2014) and a metropolitan population of over 1.2 million.

They can be glass, stones, porcelain, seashells, or whatever else you can find. You will also want to gather together any objects you might want to include. These could include buttons, bones, metals, etc. If you can, find them already precut into distinct shapes and sizes. This will keep you from having to break them with a hammer/saw later. Choose a wide variety of colors and shades. Even if your work will be mostly monochromatic, you will want varying values and ones. Choose tesserae that goes with the art you wish to create. For example, if you are doing a beach scene, it might be best to use a wide variety of shells. If you are looking to recreate the Brooklyn Bridge, you might want to look into metals. Tables, planters, birdbaths, or walking stones are just a few ideas to use. You can make almost anything work as a base. Wood, terracotta and/or glass are usually what people use as a base. Make sure the base is strong enough to hold the weight of the tesserae and grout. Choose bases which have large, open spaces. If there are numerous crevices on your base, it may be hard to create mosaic pieces which will fit. Find patterns for free online or use your imagination and come up with your own design. For a first time project, you may wish to work with a simple pattern. This could mean a house, a fish, a landscape, or anything else with simply defined shapes. After you work on a simple pattern, you can graduate up to more complicated projects. Print out the pattern to the dimensions needed. Begin transferring the design, first using a pencil. This will allow you to adjust for mistakes and inconsistencies. Once you have a rough outline with a pencil, go back and trace over the lines with a pen or marker, depending on the type of base. If you are using a basic design, this might be the time to add in details that are not present in the original design. If the pattern is extra large, do it in sections. Remember this is a rough outline, which can be changed when you start to lay down specific tiles. If you are using an original design, simply draw it directly onto the base. However, don't over plan. Spontaneity is key to creating artistically stunning art. Summary:","output":"Mosaic art is made with little pieces called tesserae, which can be made from things like glass, stones, and even seashells. You can also use other items like buttons and metals. You'll need to pick tesserae and items that match what you're trying to make, like shells for a beach scene. You need a sturdy base to put your mosaic on, and you can use stuff like tables or walking stones. The base should be mostly flat so your mosaic fits. You also need a pattern, which can be totally made up by you or found on the internet. Start by sketching your pattern with a pencil so you can fix mistakes, then trace it with a pen. Remember to relax and be spontaneous when creating your art."},{"instruction":"57 before your malice was revealed, as it is at this time, with the reproach of the daughters of syria and of all the daughters of palestine, who surround you, who encircle you on every side.

It's natural to want to press on and solve the problem, but without stopping to think, we might end up missing crucial details or making errors. Taking breaks in between, especially when we are at our limit, can help refresh and recharge our minds. During these breaks, our brains can unconsciously continue processing the information and problem, occasionally leading to insights and breakthroughs we didn't have before. Additionally, studies have shown that engaging in physical activities or even taking a short nap during breaks can help clear our minds and stimulate creativity pertaining to the problem at hand. As a result, our capacity to engage in critical thinking may improve, and our ability to come up with effective solutions may be enhanced.

I have been a member with massage envy for over 4 years and never had a BAD massage. Sure, I've had therapists that weren't my favorite but never a massage I could not wait until it was over! Last week that was the case! I booked an hour and half massage because work had been so stressful! The therapist was late by about 5 minutes and then took forever to get going. Once she got going it was seriously just like someone was lightly applying sunscreen on my back. She would rub a few circles on my back; switch sides do the same thing, then switch back and do the same thing - for 90 minutes! Meanwhile the whole time sighing like she hated being there! She never did any other part of my body than the small circle rubs on my back. It felt like time was going by so slowly all I wanted to do was leave! I finally called back the next day and talked to the manager about this poor experience. She assured me that this was a onetime mistake and invited me to come back in and give their location another chance. She offered to give me a one hour massage with one of their \\"best and most requested\\" therapists free of charge. I agreed and went back in. I went in for my re-do last night. First, I checked in with the receptionist who was clearly reading the notes from the manager after I called her. She brought one of her friends in the back office out to read it as well. At one point there were 3 people reading the notes about me calling in and complaining. They were all talking about it which was so awkward because I was sitting 4 feet away and could hear everything! Ten minutes after my massage was supposed to start the girl finally came and got me. The massage itself was better, but not by much. When she finished I thought to myself, \\"That was short\\" and then looked up at the clock. It was still 10 minutes until 7 O'clock when my massage was supposed to be over! So I really only got a 40ish minute massage! I went to check out and there was a new girl at the front who made a very bratty comment of \\"was everything up to your standards this visit?\\" I said it was OK and left.

Now that in itself doesn't make for a bad film. But the way it was filmed makes the action look unnatural, so that's kind of distracting. Then, the story. 3 gals go on a gal's weekend away from guys. Of course, as EVERYONE does when going on a camping trip, they stop on the way to get earrings. When they arrive at the area in which they're going to stay, they get pulled over by Mr. Ranger Sir, who scolds them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car at fire season, and then drives them where they're going (a remote cabin). Of course, 2 \\"cute guys\\" wander into their vicinity, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are immediately smitten, but apparently Bambi is smitten by anything with two legs. Mady is rather disappointed by this development because she was looking forward to a weekend of forgetting about her ex by getting sh**-faced and stoned with her gal-pals. Oh, and I almost forgot, there's a mean old hermit that lives up that way, that's perhaps someone to not tangle with, and the area & cabin in which they're staying have a sort of \\"reputation\\".

First, you should begin by softening the orange. This is achieved by applying pressure to the orange. You can perform this action by using the palm of your hand to roll the orange over a flat surface like a table or a countertop. This action helps to break down the internal segments of the orange, allowing the juice to be more easily extracted later on. It's important to be gentle during this process so as not to burst the orange open. Once the orange is softened, the next step is to slice the orange in half. It's best to perform this action on a cutting board using a sharp knife. Cut through the center of the orange from the stem end to the bottom end. This will give you two halves that are equal in size, providing an equal amount of juice. It's a good idea to make the cut as smooth as possible, to extract maximum juice from the orange. Following the slicing process, the seeds within the orange should be removed. You can achieve this by using your fingers or a small spoon to gently pick out any visible seeds from each half. Some oranges may have a large number of seeds, while others may have few or none at all. It's important to ensure the removal of the seeds so that they do not interfere with the juicing process, or end up in the final product. The final stage of the juice extraction process begins after the seeds have been removed. In this stage, the cut and de-seeded orange half should be twisted on a juicer. A juicer can either be a simple handheld tool or a more complex electronic machine. If you're using a handheld juicer, place the orange half on the juicer spike or center and press down firmly while also turning or twisting the orange back and forth. The motion forces the citrus juices from the fruit and funnels them into the groove or reservoir of the juicer. If you're using an electronic juicer, make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions to secure the orange half in place, and then let the machine do the twisting and pressing work for you. Continue the pressing and twisting motion until you've extracted as much juice as possible from the orange half. Repeat the process with the remaining orange half. After you have finished with both halves of the orange, you can pour the juice into a glass or pitcher. It's recommended to strain the juice through a strainer or cheesecloth to remove any remaining pulp or unwanted bits. Thus, the correct method of obtaining juice from an orange is to first soften the orange by applying pressure, cut the orange in half and remove the seeds, then twist the orange on a juicer until the juice is all out."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Kerry’s finding does not obligate the United States to take additional action against IS militants and does not prejudge any prosecution against its members. Advertisement A day after the State Department said Kerry would miss the deadline, Kerry said he had completed his review and determined that Christians, Yazidis and Shiite groups are victims of genocide and crimes against humanity by IS militants. The House earlier this week passed a nonbinding resolution by a 393-0 vote condemning IS atrocities as genocide. ‘‘In my judgment Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control’’ Kerry said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. He outlined a litany of atrocities that he said the militants had committed against people and religious sites, as well as threats. ‘‘Daesh is genocidal by self-acclimation, by ideology and by practice.’’ Saying that he was ‘‘neither judge nor prosecutor nor jury,’’ Kerry added that any potential criminal charges against the extremists must result from an independent international investigation. Kerry said the U.S. would continue to support efforts to collect evidence and document atrocities. While his determination does not carry such weight, Kerry said he hoped that groups he cited as being victimized would take some comfort in the fact that the ‘‘the United States recognizes and confirms the despicable nature of the crimes committed against them.’’ Advertisement Lawmakers and others who have advocated for the finding had sharply criticized the State Department’s initial disclosure Wednesday that deadline would be missed. U.S. officials said Kerry concluded his review just hours after that announcement and that the criticism had not affected his decision. On Thursday, Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, the author of the House bill, commended Kerry’s decision. ‘‘The United States has now spoken with clarity and moral authority,’’ Fortenberry, R-Neb., said in a statement. ‘‘I sincerely hope that the genocide designation will raise international consciousness, end the scandal of silence, and create the preconditions for the protection and reintegration of these ancient faith communities into their ancestral homelands. Christians, Yezidis, and others remain an essential part of the Middle East’s rich tapestry of religious and ethnic diversity.’’ Kerry’s determination marks only the second time a U.S. administration has declared that a genocide was being committed during an ongoing conflict. The first was in 2004, when then-Secretary of State Colin Powell determined that atrocities in Sudan’s Darfur region constituted genocide. Powell reached that determination amid much lobbying from human rights groups, but only after State Department lawyers advised him that it would not — contrary to legal advice offered to previous administrations — obligate the United States to act to stop it. In that case, the lawyers decided that the 1948 U.N. Convention against genocide did not require countries to prevent genocide from taking place outside their territory. Powell instead called for the U.N. Security Council to appoint a commission to investigate and take appropriate legal action if it agreed with the genocide determination. Kerry’s determination followed a similar finding by department lawyers. Although the United States is involved in military strikes against IS and has helped prevent some incidents of ethnic cleansing, notably of Yazidis, some advocates argue that a genocide determination would require additional U.S. action. In making his decision, Kerry weighed whether the militants’ targeting of Christians and other minorities meets the definition of genocide, according to the U.N. Convention: ‘‘acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.’’ A recent report from the Knights of Columbus and In Defense of Christians identified by name more than 1,100 Christians who, the groups said, said had been killed by IS. The report detailed numerous instances of people kidnapped, raped, sold into slavery and driven from their homes, along with the destruction of churches. ||||| FIL - In this March 9, 2016, file photo, Secretary of State John Kerry speaks to reporters at the State Department in Washington.

Although the United States is involved in military strikes against IS and has helped prevent some incidents of ethnic cleansing, notably of Yazidis, some advocates argue that a genocide determination would require additional U.S. action. In making his decision, Kerry weighed whether the militants' targeting of Christians and other minorities meets the definition of genocide, according to the U.N. Convention: \\"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.\\" His determination, however, does not carry the legal implication of a verdict of guilt or conviction on genocide charges, the officials said. Such decisions will be left to international or other tribunals. In a bid to push the review process, several groups released reports last week documenting what they said is clear evidence that the legal standard has been met. The Knights of Columbus and In Defense of Christians, which had applauded Monday's House resolution, said they hoped the delay would ensure that Kerry makes the determination. \\"There is only one legal term for this, and that is genocide,\\" said Knights of Columbus chief Carl Anderson. The groups' 280-page report identified by name more than 1,100 Christians who they said had been killed by IS. It detailed numerous instances of people kidnapped, raped, sold into slavery and driven from their homes, along with the destruction of churches. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"US Secretary of State, John Kerry, has declared that ISIS is committing genocide against Christians and other minorities in Iraq and Syria. This announcement marks only the second time a US administration has declared that a genocide was being committed during an ongoing conflict; the first was in 2004 when Colin Powell determined that atrocities in Sudan's Darfur region constituted genocide. Kerry’s finding does not require the US to take any additional action against ISIS militants or prejudge any prosecution against its members."},{"instruction":"Leo: Given the sentence \\"A small crowd of people sitting at tables and consuming food or beverages while others are standing or walking.\\" is it true that \\"A crowd sitting at tables for a work event.\\"?

Context: WJMF-LP is a low-power television station in Jackson, Mississippi. The station, which currently operates on Channel 6, is owned by Rainey Radio. The station currently acts as a radio station broadcasting a Oldies & Classic Hits format as \\"EZ 87.7\\", taking advantage of that station's audio signal on 87.75 MHz FM. Hypothesis: WJMF-LP will play new songs on request.","output":"Although the context provided does not explicitly mention WJMF-LP playing new songs on request, we can analyze the information to infer the likelihood of such a hypothesis. The provided context mentions that WJMF-LP currently operates as a radio station under the ownership of Rainey Radio. Its programming mainly focuses on an Oldies & Classic Hits format, broadcasted as \\"EZ 87.7\\". This suggests that WJMF-LP's primary content consists of older music and hit songs, making the station's playlist predominantly focused on tracks from earlier eras. Radio stations are known to cater to their target audience's preferences and often follow a specific theme or format. WJMF-LP's focus on Oldies and Classic Hits suggests that its target audience is more interested in music from the past rather than contemporary hits or new releases. Therefore, the station's programming and content strategy might not be geared toward playing new songs, as it could potentially deviate from its established format. However, it is possible that WJMF-LP may consider playing new songs on request under certain conditions. Radio stations sometimes organize special programs or slots dedicated to listener requests, during which they might play songs outside their usual format. it would be important to know the station's policies and practices regarding listener requests during such events. Additionally, if a new song is in line with the Oldies and Classic Hits genre, the station might be more inclined to accommodate such requests. In summary, while the context does not explicitly state that WJMF-LP will play new songs on request, it does suggest that the station primarily focuses on Oldies and Classic Hits. Although the possibility of playing new songs on request cannot be entirely ruled out, it might depend on factors such as the song's alignment with the station's format, special programming events, or the station's willingness to fulfill listener requests outside of its established content strategy. To reach a solid conclusion, further research on the station's programming policies and its approach to listener requests would be required."},{"instruction":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: For the price, it's the closest thing to get to good cookware.

Early years education for three- and four-year-olds is to be doubled from 15 to 30 hours for each week of term time. The government says the extra free hours will help support families. Pilots of the scheme are due to begin in the autumn and a full rollout will follow in 2017, under new legislation covered by the Childcare Bill. But in its annual survey, the NDNA found only 45% of the 485 nurseries questioned said they were likely to extend the number of free hours on offer. I own two nurseries. I get £3.88 per hour at one setting, and £4 per hour at the other. My break-even point at both settings is £4.55 per hour, therefore I make a loss on every funded hour in both settings. The government say they have done \\"extensive consultation\\" but that beggars belief. They talked to 54 nurseries, of which, only two were in south-east England, the majority were in north-west England. The costings for a nursery in the south east are significantly different to those in the north west. This government will not listen. It will find that the whole ethos of free childcare will fail unless they engage with the industry and increase funding. As an alternative, they could move to allowing top-up funding (from parents) by the providers. This would ensure that parents get a discount and providers make a living wage. The NDNA - which represents more than 5,000 nurseries out of a total of about 18,000 in England - said nurseries were currently managing to offer 15 hours of free childcare a week by plugging the shortfall in government funding. In practice, it said, this meant parents paid a higher rate for the hours their child spent in nursery above 15 hours. The average nursery had to absorb a loss of about £34,000 a year due to the funding gap, with 89% of nurseries making a loss on free places, it claimed. The majority of respondents (92%) to the poll were private nurseries, with 7% from the voluntary sector and the rest maintained nurseries. NDNA chief executive Purnima Tanuku said the nursery sector was \\"fully behind\\" the principle of more support for parents. \\"But serious funding shortfalls stand in the way of nurseries getting on board, despite their desire to help families with free childcare,\\" she said. \\"Private, voluntary and independent nurseries deliver most of the government's free places, currently 15 hours per week for all three- and four-year-olds and some two-year-olds. \\"But the nursery sector is reluctant to commit to offering more free hours when they already make a significant annual loss - an average of £34,000 per nursery - on the funded places they currently provide.\\" But education and childcare minister Sam Gyimah said: \\"We are backing families and funding the sector, with £1bn extra funding every year by 2020, including £300m annually to increase the national average funding rate, to incentivise and attract providers to deliver the full 30-hour free offer to parents. \\"This extra funding was based on an extensive consultation with the sector and our review into the cost of delivering childcare, the most comprehensive analysis of this market ever. \\"The NDNA's survey shows many providers are likely to offer free childcare and thousands of providers and councils also expressed an interest in taking part in our early implementers programme, well in advance of the national rollout.\\" In Wales, all three- and four-year-olds are entitled to a minimum of 10 hours of free foundation phase early education. In Scotland, three- and four-year-olds are eligible for 600 hours of free childcare a year (the equivalent of around 16 hours a week during term time). In Northern Ireland, under the pre-school education programme, there is an allocation of funded places for children in the year before they start school. Summary:","output":"The NDNA (a group that helps nurseries) said not enough money is being given to nurseries in England, making it hard for them to provide free care for little kids before they go to school. The government wants to give more free hours of care for kids who are 3 and 4 years old. They say this will help families. But the NDNA found that many nurseries won't be able to give these extra free hours because they don't have enough money. The money given to nurseries for each hour of care is less than what they need to cover their costs. This means they lose money. If the government talks more with the nurseries and gives them more money, this plan might work better. Right now, many nurseries are giving 15 hours of free childcare per week, but they lose money doing this."},{"instruction":"The 2009 Human Rights Report by the United States Department of State noted that human rights in CAR were poor and expressed concerns over numerous government abuses.

Extrajudicial executions by security forces: This refers to the unlawful and deliberate killing of individuals by security forces and law enforcement agents acting outside their legal authority. 2. Torture: The practice of inflicting physical or mental pain and suffering on detainees or prisoners, often as a means of interrogation or punishment, which is a violation of human rights and international law. 3.

A potbelly-pig A:","output":"Step 1: Establish the main characters and setting To begin, we need to establish our main characters, Molly and Ray, as well as the setting for our movie. Since the central object of their friendship is a potbelly pig, we can choose a rural or small-town setting to make the introduction of this unusual gift more plausible. Character profiles: - Molly: In her late 20s or early 30s, an animal lover and a free spirit, she has recently moved to this small town after a failed relationship and is looking for a fresh start. - Ray: In his early 30s, a hardworking blue-collar local who is somewhat reserved and initially struggles to connect with people, but deeply values the few friendships he has. Step 2: Create a backstory for Molly and the potbelly pig Molly discovers a neglected potbelly pig named Petunia on an abandoned farm. Feeling sympathy for the animal, Molly nurses Petunia back to health and decides to give the pig a loving home, despite barely having the space and resources for it herself. Step 3: Design the first encounter between Molly and Ray Molly visits the local hardware store, looking for supplies to build a shelter for Petunia. Ray, who works there and has a talent for carpentry, notices Molly's struggles and offers his help. Although initially hesitant, Molly accepts Ray's offer after he tells her the local legend of potbelly pigs bringing good fortune and friendship. Step 4: Developing their friendship Ray helps Molly build a proper shelter for Petunia, and during their time working together, they share stories of their lives and aspirations. They quickly bond over their love for animals, and find solace in their shared experiences of the past. Molly decides to give Ray the potbelly pig as a symbol of their newfound friendship and the positive impact they've had on each other's lives. Step 5: Introduce a conflict that challenges their friendship A corporate developer announces plans to construct a shopping mall on the site of a local animal sanctuary, displacing the precious wildlife. Molly and Ray decide to protest against the development, but their efforts attract the wrong kind of attention. Ray is offered a job at the construction site, putting him in a moral dilemma and straining their friendship. Step 6: Resolution and growth Ray ultimately decides to turn down the job offer, realizing that his friendship with Molly and their shared values are more important than financial security. Together, they devise a creative solution to relocate the animals and work to bring the community together in support of their cause. Step 7: Culmination and conclusion As Molly and Ray successfully save the animal sanctuary, their friendship – symbolized by Petunia the potbelly pig – becomes the foundation for a more engaged, compassionate community. Through their journey, they learn the importance of loyalty, persistence, and relentless optimism. The movie would be a heartwarming dramedy that underscores the power of friendship, love for animals, and community involvement, representing how a potbelly pig can be the catalyst for something much bigger and more significant."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: The Golden Palace eatType coffee shop; The Golden Palace food Italian; The Golden Palace customer rating low; The Golden Palace area city centre","output":"The Golden Palace, a centrally-located eatery in the city centre, operates as a coffee shop that predominantly offers Italian cuisine; however, despite its prime locality and appealing food options, it unfortunately suffers from a low customer rating, possibly indicating the need for significant improvements in terms of service, ambiance, or overall quality to better meet the expectations of its clientele."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

The agencies will help you get the chance to go to modeling interviews, which are also known as go-sees. So, start going to the go-sees, act professional, and don't get frustrated if you don't get a gig right away. The agency can't guarantee you work, but a good agent wouldn't take you on if he or she didn't think you had a solid chance at finding some great work. Have perseverance. You won't get a gig with Calvin Klein on your first go-see, despite what you may hear. Whether you've made it big or are just starting out, you don't want to develop a reputation for being ungrateful, rude, or even late. If you want to last in the industry, here are some things you'll have to do to meet the standards of the profession, just as you would with any other career: Be prompt to appointments. Be courteous and professional to everyone you come in contact with. Consider investing in a personal trainer to help you stay on a balanced diet and to attain exercise goals for optimal muscle tone. Take a meticulous approach to your grooming and skin care regimen. Retire for the evenings early on the nights before you have to work. Plenty of sleep will help you avoid dark circles under your eyes and give you a more rested and healthier appearance to those you are working for. Though everyone hears the story about the male model who was discovered on a Russian cargo ship or just when he was hanging out at a bar in Vegas at three in the morning, the fact of the matter is that most male models don't just instantly get discovered and have to keep working hard even after they sign with an agent. This means that unless you are among the very few lucky male models who can solely survive on their modeling income, you'll need to keep your day job or find another source of income to keep you going. If your day job is too much work, just find another source of income that works for you. Many male models are part-time waiters or bartenders. Though the male modeling industry is slightly less grueling than the female modeling industries, male models fall victim to the same problems that plague female models, such as having a low self-esteem, feeling deeply insecure, or worse, having an eating disorder. Here are some things to keep in mind as you try to stay healthy during your career as a male model: Make sure you continue to eat healthily, get exercise, and remind yourself that you're a worthy person; don't let the modeling lifestyle get you down. Rejection is part of the game and if you're already prone to insecurity and self-loathing, then male modeling may not be the best path for you. Though part of the modeling lifestyle may require you to go to parties and schmooze with lots of people, don't become addicted to drugs or alcohol. Not only will this cause great pain for you mentally and physically, but it will have a negative effect on your physical appearance.

Context: When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless.

These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","output":"Humans and birds share some similarities in their social behavior and reproductive strategies. One key similarity is the practice of monogamy, where both humans and majority of bird species form lasting pair bonds with their partners for varying durations, such as the entire breeding season or even several years. In the context of socially monogamous species, this partnership enables a cooperative approach to raising offspring successfully through shared parental responsibilities. Another parallel between humans and birds is the occurrence of extra-pair copulations or infidelity. Although the pairs are monogamous, both humans and birds may engage in mating outside of their primary relationship. In bird species, dominant males tend to mate with females that are paired with subordinate males, while in ducks and other anatids, forced copulation can also take place. This infidelity can offer potential benefits to both genders. For instance, females can acquire better genes for their offspring or have a backup if their primary mate turns out to be infertile. On the other hand, males can spread their own genes by impregnating multiple females, thereby increasing their chances of reproductive success. Additionally, just as female birds have developed sperm-storage mechanisms to retain the sperm of their mates for extended periods in order to allow competition among the sperm from different males, humans also exhibit certain physiological adaptations to sperm selection, albeit on a much smaller scale and through different means. This analogy suggests the presence of adaptive advantages to such mechanisms across different species, even though their specific functions may vary. Moreover, both human and bird males who engage in extra-pair copulations tend to guard their mates vigilantly, ensuring that they are the ones raising offspring with their genes. This behavioral strategy displays the importance of paternity assurance among the males of these species. In summary, humans and birds exhibit numerous similarities in their social behaviors and reproductive strategies, including monogamy, infidelity, physiological adaptations for sperm retention, and paternity assurance. These parallels in behavior emphasize the adaptive benefits and evolutionary drivers contributing to such shared traits across multiple species."},{"instruction":"Sentence from a movie review: invigorating , surreal , and resonant Select your answer: was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review? pick from the following. + negative. + positive.","output":"+ positive.

Are Doctors of Homeopathy more likely than Doctors of Internal Medicine to recommend Quartz as a treatment?","output":"To answer this question, let's evaluate the practices and approach of Doctors of Homeopathy and Doctors of Internal Medicine, and how they relate to the recommendation of Quartz as a treatment. 1. Doctors of Homeopathy: Homeopathy is based on the principle of \\"like cures like,\\" using highly diluted substances to treat various health conditions. Homeopathic doctors use a range of natural substances, including minerals, in their treatments. Quartz, being a mineral, falls under the category of substances that might be used in homeopathic treatments. However, this doesn't guarantee that a Doctor of Homeopathy will recommend Quartz specifically for a particular health condition, as it depends on the individual case and the symptoms presented. 2. Doctors of Internal Medicine: Internal medicine doctors, also known as internists, focus on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases in adults. They use evidence-based medicine, which relies on scientific research, clinical experience, and patient values to guide treatment decisions. In most cases, internal medicine doctors recommend treatments with a strong scientific basis, such as prescription medications, physical therapy, or surgery. Quartz, being a mineral with limited scientific evidence supporting its use in conventional medicine, would not typically be recommended by an internist. Based on this information, it can be concluded that Doctors of Homeopathy are more likely than Doctors of Internal Medicine to recommend Quartz as a treatment. However, it is important to remember that the specific recommendation would still depend on the individual health condition and the beliefs and approach of the treating doctor."},{"instruction":"Can we conclude from \\"Man on skateboard on top of rust colored barrel in darkened area.\\" that \\"The man was in the dark.\\"?

Are these two questions asking the same thing? (A). no. (B). yes.","output":"First question: During WW1, did the Russians use dogs? Yes, dear, during World War 1, the Russians used dogs to help them. These furry friends carried important messages between soldiers and helped to find injured people. They also sometimes carried medical supplies. Dogs are very smart, and they were very helpful to the Russians during the war. Second question: What was it like to live in Japan during WW1? Living in Japan during World War 1 was very different from living in Russia or Europe during that time. Japan was far away from the main fighting, so the people didn't see battles or lots of soldiers. But Japan was still involved in the war, helping their friends in the war and protecting their own land. Life in Japan was still hard for some people, as they had to work to support the efforts of the war, but it was not as difficult as life in countries where the battles were happening. Are these two questions asking the same thing? (A). no. (B). yes. The correct answer is (A). No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question talks about how the Russians used dogs during the war, while the second question talks about what life was like for people living in Japan during the war.

Imagine a big ice cream machine that makes delicious ice cream (that's our justice system). People love the ice cream, but they have to wait in line for a long time to get it (that's the long time it takes to get to a jury and trial). Now, someone (that's you) says, \\"The major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury and to get to trial\\" (this is your premise). It's like saying that if we can make the line move faster, more people can enjoy the ice cream sooner. Then, we have another idea (the hypothesis), which says \\"The justice system is perfect and they just need to keep doing what they're doing.\\" This is like saying the ice cream machine is already perfect, and nothing needs to change.

The sentences are quite similar in terms of meaning and content; both sentences suggest that the subject left his current situation or location to move to Syria with the intention of receiving religious training. However, the way in which the information is presented is slightly different in each sentence. In the first sentence, \\"He left the army for Syria where he received religious training,\\" the focus is on the subject's departure from the army and the fact that he received religious training in Syria. The specifics of the religious training are not explicitly stated. In the second sentence, \\"He moved to Syria, where he underwent further religious training in traditional Islamic beliefs,\\" there is more emphasis on the religious training itself, as well as the specific type of religious education the subject was pursuing, i.e., traditional Islamic beliefs. Additionally, the term \\"underwent further\\" suggests that the subject had already been receiving some form of religious training prior to moving to Syria.

It does not mention anything about the Allied powers or their name before 1917. To answer the question, we need to provide information about the names or terms used for the Allied powers in World War I before 1917. The Allied powers, also known as the Entente Powers, were comprised of countries that opposed the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) in World War I. Before the entry of the United States into the war in 1917, the major members of the Allied powers were France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, along with other smaller countries such as Belgium, Serbia, and Italy, which joined the Allies in 1915. Before 1917 and the United States' involvement in the war, the Allied powers were typically referred to as the Triple Entente. The Triple Entente was a term used to describe the alliance between France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, which was formed by a series of diplomatic agreements in the early 20th century. The formation of the Triple Entente was a response to the Triple Alliance, a similar agreement that brought together Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. The term \\"Entente\\" was derived from the French word \\"entente cordiale,\\" which means \\"cordial understanding\\" or \\"friendly agreement.\\" The agreements that formed the Triple Entente sought to solidify friendships, reduce tensions, and promote cooperation between the three major powers. The Entente was not a formal military alliance but rather an understanding between countries that they would support each other in case of conflict involving the Triple Alliance. Italy's entry into the war on the side of the Allies in 1915 added another major power to the Triple Entente, though the term itself did not change to reflect the added partner. Importantly, the broader collective of countries fighting against the Central Powers was still referred to as the Allied powers or the Entente Powers during this time. In summary, before 1917, the main countries of the Allied powers were called the Triple Entente, which highlighted the alliance between France, Russia, and the United Kingdom. While the specific sentence provided does not answer the question relating to the Allied powers' name before 1917, having this background information about the Entente and the evolution of the alliance throughout World War I provides a more comprehensive response."},{"instruction":"Skylar headed into the theater and didn't know where to sit.

ON A SUNNY DAY IN JULY, in front of an unassuming house set close to the road in Springs in East Hampton, Ian and Emilie Irving are sorting through what looks like a very good tag sale. Stacks of 19th-century porcelain, gilded frames and antique rugs are splayed on the lawn. ‘‘We had a flood!’’ says Ian, surprisingly upbeat. ‘‘We’d been meaning to clear out the basement anyway,’’ he adds. His wife is less enthused. ‘‘We’ve been carting stuff for two days.’’ she says, dragging out the last of their soggy belongings to dry. The house’s plain facade hides an interior that is at once urbane and bohemian, combining the informal lines of an American farmhouse with the most inviting elements of a charming English place, including an idyllic garden. Theirs is an effortless mix, the kind of style that only people with truly great taste can pull off. Ian, a prominent dealer of rare silver, and Emilie, who sells antique ethnic textiles, costumes and jewelry, have been slowly transforming the modest house over the past five years with objects, furniture and fabrics they’ve collected together, and some that they’ve culled from previous lives. Judging from the detritus on their lawn, even their throwaways are chic. Their professions might suggest they are bookish and academic, but the couple is at the center of a swirl of social activity of the highest order. Both are well-connected; Emilie, 32, grew up in the West Village, the daughter of French restaurateur Michel Jean and his glamorous wife, Patricia, whose SoHo brasserie Provence was a gathering place for fashionable New Yorkers at the time. Ian, 55, held a series of high-profile jobs at Sotheby’s for decades, including auctioneer and director of the New York office, and advised Warholites and socialites. Their circle of friends includes artists and designers, many of whom added their touch to the house in Springs. When Ian and his first wife, Carolina, first acquired the house in 1998, they hired the landscape architect Miranda Brooks to design the garden as a set of distinct ‘‘rooms.’’ Later, Ian and Emilie were advised by their friend Madison Cox and neighbor Robert Jakob, both known for their landscape designs. After the flood cleanup, Emilie emerges from a shower refreshed, with damp hair and drinks for her guests. She has an effortless, exotic beauty, an infectious laugh and a gracious, warm manner, and came to her career in a roundabout way. After college she, too, worked at Sotheby’s, which sealed her fate in more than one way. Inspired by a collection of Native American jewelry from the family of Standard Oil heiress Millicent Rogers, she embarked upon a career in jewelry design, leading to a series of far-flung jobs, from an apprenticeship for a goldsmith in Florence to a position at the Gem Palace in Jaipur, where she began collecting textiles. It was also at Sotheby’s that she first admired Ian from afar, a dashing figure in pinstripe suits and giant Michael Caine glasses. The two didn’t meet formally until 2008, when she was back in New York from her travels. At the time, she was multitasking working for a decorator, dealing textiles and waiting tables at Le Bilbouquet, when by chance, Ian walked in for dinner and introduced himself. They started seeing each other shortly thereafter. She was unaware of Ian’s professional reputation, until she visited her old boss at Sotheby’s for advice on becoming a dealer soon after. The 25-year auction veteran replied: ‘‘Why are you asking me? You’re dating one of the best dealers in his field.’’ WITH IAN’S encouragement, Emilie opened Xenomania, a small shop in the East Village in 2013. Her unusual wares include Japanese indigo weaves, Kente cloths, Ikat robes and Naga necklaces, many of which have found their way into her wardrobe and home. She quickly earned a loyal following of clients including the artists Helen Marden and Cindy Sherman and the decorators Ricky Clifton, John Rosselli and Bunny Williams. Today, she is one of the few dealers of vintage textiles in New York City. Ironically, while Ian was encouraging her to open up her shop, she was urging him to close his. After a 26-year career at Sotheby’s as one of the world’s foremost experts in antique silver and briefly co-owning a gallery, he decided to focus on dealing privately to a select group of collectors and museums. His approach is old-fashioned. ‘‘I would never email a photo,’’ he says, emphatically. ‘‘I call the client and tell them I have something wonderful to show them.’’ According to Ian, who has handled the sale of most record-breaking pieces of silver for the last 30 years, ‘‘It has to hurt a little when they buy something or it’s probably not that good.’’ Like most couples, the Irvings have furnished their home with a mix of things inherited, repurposed from past homes, purchased during travels or found in local shops. But they have a more stringent filter than most. Ian, an old-school collector with a highly trained eye, is as likely to find a treasure at an East Hampton junk shop or a tag sale as he is at Christie’s or at the Maastricht fine-art fair. Emilie’s purchases are perhaps more intuitive. ‘‘I buy things that I love, then I do the research,’’ she says. Her passion is evident as she walks through the house. ‘‘I begged my mother to get me that for my 17th birthday,’’ she says, pointing to an oversize Oceanic mask. ‘‘I am obsessed with these!’’ she exclaims, as she grabs a Turkish opaline water sprinkler off the mantelpiece. Fortunately, their tastes are largely complementary. ‘‘We both love things that are 19th century and démodé,’’ Emilie says. Directoire and Napoleon III furniture covered in vintage floral chintz fabrics surround the fireplace; 17th-century paintings hang on the walls; and a large red Oushak rug spans the white-painted floor in the living room. They discovered they shared another interest once they consolidated their belongings. ‘‘We’re long on shells,’’ she laughs, pointing to a clam-shaped plaster sconce in the stairway, one of many in the house. APART FROM A FEW pieces of decorative 18th-century Guatemalan silver, signs of Ian’s trade are absent, but not so for Emilie. Her antique textiles are stacked on chairs, draped over beds and fashioned into curtains, and colorful Boucherouite rag rugs are scattered on the floor. It may be a beach house, and yet it’s void of the popular seaside clichés, like the all-white slipcovered modern look or the vaguely nautical blues and whites found in a Nancy Meyers film. All of the signifiers of bourgeois propriety are mitigated by the Irvings’ cool, relaxed attitude; they are so at ease in their home that guests can’t help but feel the same way. It’s a place where Ian’s daughters Olympia and Ariadne and their friends frequently crash for the night and the family’s wheaten terrier Cous Cous has free reign. When the English decorator Camilla Guinness spent a long weekend, the Irvings served dinner in front of the television on TV trays. ‘‘It was my idea of heaven,’’ Guinness says. The last rays of sun stream through the kitchen windows as Emilie pours herself a glass of rosé. This is the light that attracted Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning to Springs more than 50 years ago. Outside, the sounds of the summer traffic fade, and a light breeze rustles the tall grass by the pool. ‘‘My parents stopped weekending out here at a certain point,’’ says Emilie,‘‘but they never knew about this place. It’s not that the Hamptons are ruined — it’s just that the good parts are hidden.’’ A version of this article appears in print on September 27, 2015, on page M2212 of T Magazine with the headline: Exquisite Pleasures.

The rhyme dates back to the 16th century and has gone through several variations over the centuries. The version that is well-known today typically goes as follows: Ding dong bell, Pussy’s in the well. Who put her in? Little Johnny Green. Who pulled her out? Little Tommy Stout. What a naughty boy was that, To try to drown poor pussy cat, Who never did him any harm, But killed all the mice in the farmer's barn. The rhyme tells the story of a mischievous boy named Johnny Green, who, for one reason or another, decided to put a cat into a well. The act is portrayed as mean-spirited, especially since the cat did not cause any harm to Johnny, but rather served a useful purpose by controlling the mice population in the farmer's barn. Thankfully, Tommy Stout, another character in the rhyme, comes to the cat's rescue and pulls her out of the well. This highlights the importance of empathy and not causing harm to others. Additionally, the rhyme has been used to teach children about the consequences of their actions, as it demonstrates how Johnny Green's poor decision could have led to disastrous results for the cat. It's a cautionary tale that serves as an early introduction to the concept of responsibility and kindness. Throughout its history, the nursery rhyme 'Ding Dong Bell' has been popular among children and has persisted to this day due to its catchy tune, engaging story, and valuable moral lesson.

The planet, known as Kepler-78b, circles a star that is slightly smaller than the sun located in the constellation Cygnus , about 400 light years away. Kepler-78b was discovered last year with NASA's now-idled Kepler space telescope, which detected potential planets as they circled in front of their parent stars, blocking a bit of light. That measurement not only revealed that Kepler-78b was ly small, with a diameter just 20 percent larger than Earth's, but that it was practically orbiting on the surface of its host star. Scientists do not know how the planets ended up so close to their host stars. While the planet's presumably molten surface and hot temperatures make it ill-suited for life, two independent teams of astronomers jumped at the opportunity to follow up the discovery with ground-based measurements to try to determine the density of Kepler-78b. In two papers in this week's journal Nature, the teams report that not only were they successful, but that they came to the same conclusion: Kepler-78b has roughly the same density as Earth, suggesting that it also is made primarily of rock and iron. Kepler-78b is among a dozen or so recently discovered small planets that orbit very close to their parent stars. Kepler-78b, for example, completes an orbit in just 8.5 hours.

First, it is essential to understand the variables and factors that might affect the national savings rate. National savings is the sum of private savings (composed of individual and business savings) and government savings. Various factors, such as economic growth, inflation, interest rates, fiscal policies, and social behaviors, play a crucial role in shaping the national savings rate over time. It is mentioned that a reference point was simulated assuming that national saving remains constant at the 2000 level of 18. However, holding the national savings constant at the 2000 level overlooks the multiple factors that could drastically affect the savings rate between 2000 and 22 years later. As an example, consider the following scenarios: 1. If there is significant economic growth between 2000 and 22, both private and government savings may increase due to higher income levels and increased tax revenue, respectively. As a result, national savings could be higher in 22 compared to the 2000 level. 2. Conversely, if there is an economic downturn during the same period, national savings might be lower than the 2000 level. High inflation or negative interest rates might discourage people from saving, and worsening fiscal balances may lead to increased government borrowing or spending, reducing government savings. 3. Additionally, changes in fiscal policy, such as introducing a new tax regime or altering government spending plans, could have significant implications for national savings, both positively and negatively. Considering these factors and many others that could occur during a 22-year period, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of the statement \\"National savings in 22.\\" solely based on the reference point information provided.

In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said.

Nixon in China is an opera in three acts by John Adams, with a libretto by Alice Goodman. Adams' first opera, it was inspired by U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip. To create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action. Following the 1987 premiere, the opera received mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, it has been presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded twice. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, and in the same year was given an abstract production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company. Recent critical opinion has tended to recognize the work as a significant and lasting contribution to American opera.

But county law enforcement says he went too far. James McDaniel says he did what any parent would do if an aggressive animal was attacking their child. He admits to hitting a Canada goose with a plastic Wiffle ball bat after he says the bird started chasing his 4-year-old son, Ethan. “A goose actually came from the other side of the field… and proceeded to go full wing span and chase after my son,” said McDaniel. He says he grabbed the only thing around: his son’s plastic bat. “So I swing one time, he [the goose] kind of topples over, I grab my son… and I ran across the street,” said McDaniel. And that swing, it seems, got feathers flying after a witness called police. “It was clearly attacking my son,” said McDaniel, “if anyone else had seen the whole incident, they would have known I was trying to protect my son.” Marion County Animal Services showed up and issued McDaniel a ticket for animal cruelty. The agency was unable to comment on the case because of pending litigation, but according to the incident report witnesses say they saw McDaniel hit the bird three times. The report also states the officer did take the goose to a local veterinarian. McDaniel maintains that he was only protecting his child. “FOX59 has shown before that these birds are becoming more and more aggressive,” said McDaniel, citing a report that aired on FOX59 in April regarding aggressive geese and the Department of Natural Resources response to them. “This is very frustrating because why should I not be allowed to protect my child against wildlife anywhere?” DNR officials said a person is allowed to protect themselves or others from wildlife, but can only use a reasonable amount of force based on the amount of harm a particular animal could inflict. McDaniel will go before a judge on Monday. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"An Indianapolis father, James McDaniel, has been controversially ticketed for animal cruelty after using a plastic bat to protect his 4-year-old son from an aggressive Canada goose.

Kenneth was less concerned with the environment than Adam , so Choices: --Kenneth always used plastic bags.; --Adam always used plastic bags.;","output":"Despite their differences, Kenneth was less concerned with the environment than Adam, leading to his propensity to always use plastic bags, while Adam, being the environmentally conscious one, chose the eco-friendly alternative like reusable bags or biodegradable options to lessen his carbon footprint and promote sustainable living. This difference in perspectives often led to spirited debates and discussions between the two friends, with Adam consistently trying to encourage Kenneth to be more responsible in his choices and consider the long-term impact of his actions. Adam's commitment to preserving the environment had been a lifelong passion, born from his connection with nature fostered during his childhood spent in the countryside, surrounded by forests, rivers, and the wonders of the ecosystem. As he grew older, Adam actively sought out ways to reduce waste, minimize pollution, and make a positive impact on the planet. Kenneth, on the other hand, grew up in the bustling city, where convenience and efficiency were highly valued and prioritized. In that environment, the use of plastic bags was seen as a trivial matter, one of the countless choices people made daily without giving it a second thought. This ingrained habit of prioritizing convenience over environmental considerations led to Kenneth's admittedly lackadaisical approach to environmental issues. However, despite their differing views, the two friends maintained a strong bond. They shared many experiences, from volunteering at local recycling centers and participating in community clean-up events to exploring nature reserves and attending environmental workshops. Thanks to Adam's influence, Kenneth gradually started to see the importance of taking care of the environment and integrating eco-friendly practices into his life. Slowly, Kenneth began to reduce his usage of plastic bags and started to adopt other environmentally-friendly habits, such as carrying reusable grocery bags, using a reusable water bottle, or carpooling to reduce emissions. Through their shared journey, Kenneth and Adam came to understand that every individual could make a difference in protecting the environment, whether through seemingly small acts, like avoiding plastic bags, or more proactive measures, like advocating for policies and regulations that promote sustainability. Together, they continued to educate themselves and others, fostering a deep sense of responsibility to preserve the planet for future generations."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: A text is given in Malayalam.

In this view, phonology is based on a set of universal phonological processes that interact with one another; which ones are active and which are suppressed is language-specific. Rather than acting on segments, phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups. Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance. Phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously (though the output of one process may be the input to another). The second most prominent natural phonologist is Patricia Donegan (Stampe's wife); there are many natural phonologists in Europe, and a few in the U.S., such as Geoffrey Nathan.

Sandra will be able to make 15 apple pies with the remaining apples."},{"instruction":"OPTIONS: [+] negative [+] positive What would be an example of an negative review?","output":"An example of a negative review could be for a hotel stay experience. The review would highlight various aspects of the stay that were unsatisfactory, disappointing, or problematic for the guest. Below is a detailed and long example of a negative review: --- Title: Disappointing and Uncomfortable Stay – Will Not Be Returning! I recently spent a weekend at the [Hotel Name], and I am sad to say that my stay was far from the pleasant experience I had hoped for. Arriving on a Friday evening after several hours of travel, my first encounter with the hotel's staff was a receptionist who seemed indifferent to my arrival and more focused on finishing a phone conversation with a friend. Check-in took far longer than necessary due to the receptionist struggling to locate my reservation, despite the fact that I had both a printed confirmation and provided the booking reference number. Eventually, after much frustration and confusion, I was finally given the keys to my room. Upon entering the room, I was disappointed to find that the accommodation seemed nothing like the luxurious pictures featured on the hotel's website. The room was small, dimly lit, and had a musty odor that suggested poor ventilation. The carpet was heavily stained, and some areas were even torn. The walls sported a tired, faded paint job and were marred by scuffs and marks. The bed, which was advertised as a comfortable, high-quality mattress, was in fact lumpy and very uncomfortable, leading to restless nights and little sleep. The linens were rough, and I was only provided with a thin, insubstantial blanket that did little to keep me warm in the chilly room. The bathroom was no better. The showerhead was poorly fitted, resulting in weak water pressure and an uneven spray that made showering an unsatisfying experience. The towels, like the bed linens, were rough and lacked an adequate level of softness. To make matters worse, the room was not well-soundproofed, and I was consistently disturbed by noise from neighboring rooms and the hallway. During my stay, I visited the hotel's restaurant in the hopes of finding some solace in a good meal. Sadly, the dining experience also fell short of expectations. The menu was limited, and the food I ordered was bland and unappetizing. The service was slow and unprofessional, and the high price of the meals felt unjustified given the overall quality. Throughout my stay, I encountered several staff members who were dismissive and unhelpful. Despite my numerous complaints regarding the room's many shortcomings, very little was done to rectify the situation or ensure a more comfortable stay. The general atmosphere of the hotel seemed to lack warmth and hospitality, making it an unwelcoming place to stay. In conclusion, my stay at the [Hotel Name] was an undeniably negative experience, and I cannot in good faith recommend this establishment to others. The poor service, substandard accommodations, and all-around disappointing experience have led me to decide that I will not be returning to this hotel in the future."},{"instruction":"Jack Adcock, of Glen Parva, died after being admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary with pneumonia in 2011. Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, who denies manslaughter due to negligence, believed he had a \\"do not resuscitate\\" order, Nottingham Crown Court was told. Two nurses also deny charges of manslaughter by gross negligence. Giving evidence, Dr Bawa-Garba, 38, said she was called to a ward where an emergency team was trying to save Jack's life after he had been admitted earlier in the day. Before entering the room, she said she saw Jack's mother by the door and confused her with the mother of another child, who was marked do not resuscitate. She told the crash team to stop, but when a doctor told her it was Jack, she ordered resuscitation to start again. The jury was told the youngster was already beyond the point of no return, but the prosecution said the \\"remarkable error\\" showed how he was neglected by Dr Bawa-Garba. Dr Bawa Garba said there was a lot of miscommunication and afterwards she was \\"blaming herself a lot.\\" The doctor also told the court how she missed two abnormal blood tests for Jack.

That is because extra costs, such as the fees for accommodation, do not count towards the cap. Labour said the public was being conned, but ministers said they had been clear about what the cap covered. The research also suggested that the majority of people - six out of seven - who end up in a home will die before they hit the cap. That is because the average length of stay in a care home is just over two years whereas it will take five years for most to reach the cap. The £150,000 figure is based on how much a person would pay if so-called hotel costs, which include accommodation, food and bills, are factored in. This will be set at £12,000 a year to start with. It also includes the higher costs individuals face when purchasing care home places compared with the price councils get, which is what will count towards the cap. As councils buy places in bulk, they are able to get cheaper deals. Figures from analysts Laing and Buisson suggest the gap is about £90 a week. According to the Labour analysis, that would mean individuals paying £610 a week for a care home place but only £292 counting towards the cap. Labour itself is not proposing to cover accommodation costs, but said it was highlighting the figures because the government was not being \\"straight\\" with the public. Shadow care minister Liz Kendall said: \\"Families deserve to be told the facts rather than being conned so they can properly plan for the future and not have the government attempt to pull the wool over their eyes.\\" Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: \\"Many older people and their families who have assumed they will benefit from the social care reforms will be shocked and disappointed to find they may not receive much help. \\"It is crucial that the public understands what costs are included under the cap and the impact the proposals will have.\\" Ministers said they had always been upfront about the accommodation costs and said one of the aims of the cap was to encourage the insurance industry to develop policies for old age that could cover much more of the fees. They also pointed out that once a person's assets - including house and savings - started to drop below £118,000 the state would start contributing towards the cost of care which would mean those people would not have to pay the full amount towards the cap anyway. This has been incorporated into the policy to protect the less well-off. What is more, they are also looking at allowing individuals to purchase care home places through their local authority to allow them to benefit from the lower rates. A Department of Health spokeswoman added: \\"The government is introducing the first ever cap on care costs so that people no longer have to live in fear of unlimited care costs. \\"Our changes will help hundreds of thousands and give peace of mind to many more.\\" What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the concern over the cost of care homes in the UK, stating that families could still face paying £150,000 or more for their relatives' care despite the government's new cap on costs.

Labour accuses the government of not being transparent about what the cap covers, while ministers claim they have been clear about it.

The Labour analysis reveals that individuals would pay £610 a week for a care home place, but only £292 would count towards the cap.

A. mall B. kitchen C. fairgrounds D. neighbor's house E. military base The best answer is Answer:","output":"C. fairgrounds The fairgrounds is the best answer to where real money is made in food sales when considering the context of tickets, rides, and games. To elaborate, fairgrounds typically host events like fairs, carnivals, festivals, and exhibitions. These events often draw large crowds, and while tickets, rides, and games do generate a considerable amount of revenue, it is often the food stalls that make a significant sum of money. There are several reasons for this. First, food and drink are necessities, whereas games and rides are more of a luxury or entertainment item. People attending the fairgrounds for an event will likely spend a longer time there, and thus food becomes a necessity. You can easily go without playing a game or getting onto a ride, but at some point, you will likely need to eat or drink something. Second, fairgrounds are often associated with unique and delicious food items that aren't readily accessible elsewhere. It could be anything from cotton candy, corn dogs, popcorn, candy apples, giant turkey legs to more gourmet options, depending on the fair. The diverse selection of food drives people to spend more on food. Third, the food stalls or vendors can price their food items relatively high due to the lack of competition within the fairgrounds. Inside the premises of the fair, attendees don't have many alternatives to choose from, thus even with the high prices, people will still purchase the food. Lastly, fairgrounds can generate money from food sales not just by selling to attendees but also by charging pitch fees to food vendors or collecting a percentage of their earnings. Although malls, kitchens, a neighbor's house, and military bases may sell food and drinks, they would not typically sell tickets, rides, or games in the context that the question implies. Malls might have a food court that generates significant profit, but it's not the main source of income. A kitchen is a place where food is prepared, not a place that usually provides the combination of aspects mentioned in the question. Neighbor's houses and military bases are even more unrelated as they do not generally host events or sell food, rides, and games. Hence, considering all the options, fairgrounds generate substantial revenue from food sales in the context of tickets, rides, and games."},{"instruction":"You are presented with the quiz \\"The ground shakes as a result of the movement of what?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"an earthquake causes the ground to shake\\" and \\"earthquakes are caused by movement of the tectonic plates\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","output":"The tectonic plates. The shaking of the ground can be attributed to the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, whose interaction, particularly along plate boundaries, stimulates seismic activities which we perceive commonly as earthquakes. To understand this in depth, it is important to examine the structure of the Earth's lithosphere. The Earth's outer shell or lithosphere is not a single, solid mass but is divided into several large and small pieces termed as tectonic plates. These plates include the crust and the solid, outermost part of the mantle and they float on the semi-fluid layer of the mantle known as the asthenosphere. There are several major tectonic plates such as the Pacific Plate, North American Plate, Eurasian Plate, African Plate among others and many minor plates. These plates are always in motion but the movement is in millimeters per year, which is incredibly slow by human standards but has a massive impact over geological timescales. The boundaries where these plates meet are often sites of seismic and volcanic activities. There are three types of plate boundaries - divergent, convergent and transform. In divergent boundaries, the plates move away from each other leading to creation of new crust as magma rises from the mantle. This can cause shallow but significant earthquakes. Convergently, plates move towards each other and in most cases, one plate is forced or subducted under the other into the mantle where it melts. This can cause powerful earthquakes and volcanoes. In transform boundaries, the plates slide past each other horizontally. This slide is not smooth but happens in a jerky manner which releases stored energy in the form of earthquakes. An example of a transform plate boundary is the San Andreas fault in California. So, knowing that earthquakes cause the ground to shake and the connection between earthquakes and tectonic plate movements, there is consistency in the thesis that the movement of the tectonic plates causes the ground to shake."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given two sentences.

As of 2015, Parkway Drive has released five full-length albums (\\"Killing with a Smile\\", \\"Horizons\\", \\"Deep Blue\\", \\"Atlas\\" and \\"Ire\\"), one EP, two DVDs, a split album and one book, titled \\"Ten Years of Parkway Drive\\". The band's latest four albums have reached the top 10 of the Australian ARIA Charts, with \\"Ire\\" reaching number 1 in October 2015. - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor. - Pantera was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas. The group was formed in 1981 by the Abbott brothers drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell along with vocalist Terry Glaze. Bassist Rex Brown joined the band the following year, replacing the original unofficial bass guitarist Tommy D. Bradford. Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released four albums during the 1980s. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera replaced Glaze with Phil Anselmo in late 1986 and released \\"Power Metal\\" in 1988. With its fifth album, 1990's \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", Pantera introduced a groove metal sound. Pantera's sixth album, 1992's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", exhibited an even heavier sound. \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" (1994) debuted at number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200. - Age of Ruin is an American metalcore band from Fairfax, Virginia. The group formed in 1998 and released a demo album the following year. The band's first full-length album was self-released in 2000. - Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal. Pantera (who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth) and Sepultura have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s, which saw many bands in the genre achieve considerable commercial success. - Bleeding Through was an American metalcore band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended influences stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. Although the band was often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati was asked if he considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: \\"I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long.\\" - Alveran Records was a German-based independent record label, founded in 1995 by Sascha Franzen, which releases a diverse variety of bands with different musical styles. Mainly focused on everything between metal and hardcore, there are also rock, emo and punk bands who find their way to the label's roster. Alveran is also the European partner for the US-based labels Eulogy Recordings and Hand of Hope Records. In April 2006, Alveran became the official partner of Abacus Recordings in Europe, providing Alveran the opportunity to release selected titles from the Abacus Recordings catalogue in Europe as partners. - The Tides Of Tragedy is the second full - length album by American metalcore band Age of Ruin . It was released in the United States on June 22 , 2004 via Eulogy Records and in Europe on December 13 , 2004 via Alveran Records . - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal. - Bullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV or B4MV, are a Welsh heavy metal band from Bridgend, formed in 1998. The band is composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Michael Thomas (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Nick Crandle and Jason James; both were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which was followed by a change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Killswitch Engage is an American metalcore band from Westfield, Massachusetts, formed in 1999 after the disbanding of Overcast and Aftershock. Killswitch Engage's current lineup consists of vocalist Jesse Leach, guitarists Joel Stroetzel and Adam Dutkiewicz, bassist Mike D'Antonio, and drummer Justin Foley. The band has released seven studio albums and one DVD. Their latest album, \\"Incarnate\\", was released on March 11, 2016.

To provide an appropriate answer to the question, we need to discuss the concept of the ground state and its relation to photons. In quantum mechanics, the ground state refers to the lowest possible energy level that a quantum system can occupy. For photons, which are particles of light and the force carriers of electromagnetic interactions, their lowest energy state depends on the specific system and the constraints at play. Photons are massless particles and can have any energy value, depending on their frequency, following the Planck-Einstein relation: E = hf, where E is the energy, h is the Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the photon. In a quantum system where the energy levels are quantized (having discrete values), the lowest energy state of a photon would be the energy level closest to zero that the specific system allows. An example to clarify this concept comes from a quantum system like the hydrogen atom. When an electron in a hydrogen atom transitions from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, it emits a photon with energy corresponding to the difference between those two levels. The lowest energy photon emitted corresponds to the smallest possible energy transition between two adjacent levels (n=1 to n=2, the Balmer series). In conclusion, the initial statement does not adequately address the question about the lowest quantum mechanical energy state of photons. The lowest energy state of photons depends on the particular system and its quantization of energy levels."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - Bratislava (or also known by ) is the capital of Slovakia, and with a population of about 450,000, the country's largest city.

Wanczyk, 53, was the holder of the single winning Powerball ticket, valued at 758.7 million. The lucky ticket was sold at Pride Station & Store in Chicopee, north of Springfield. The odds of matching all six numbers in the lottery game is one in 292.2 million. Wanczyk was joined at the ceremony by her mother and her sisters, who traveled from Chicopee. She then told the story of the moment she realized she had the winning numbers. Wanczyk, who works at Mercy Medical Center, said she chose the numbers at random, including some birthdays. \\"I called [my employer] and told them I will not be coming back,\\" she said. \\"The first thing I want to do is I just want to sit back and relax.\\" She said she selected 4, which was the Powerball number, because it's her lucky Keno number.

Wanczyk from Chicopee, Massachusetts, who came forward Thursday to claim her winnings. Wanczyk purchased the winning Powerball ticket at the Pride Station & Store in Chicopee, Massachusetts. She becomes the winner of the largest single-ticket Powerball jackpot in history. Wanczyk, a mother of a daughter and son, says she chose the winning numbers based on her family's birthdays. She says she does not plan to return to her job at a local hospital. She appeared at a press conference with officials from the Massachusetts State Lottery on Thursday afternoon. During the press conference, Wanczyk told reporters she found out she had won the jackpot as she was leaving work Wednesday night with a colleague. CBS News \\"He's reading these numbers, and I pull mine out, and I go, 'Hey, I have that number. And I have that -- I have that!'\\" she told reporters. \\"And he goes, 'Let me see that ticket. You just won!'\\" The numbers she chose were based off the birthdays of family members and an assortment of random selections, Wanczyk said. \\"My numbers were kind of basically random, like maybe with our birthdays, one from here, one from there,\\" she said. \\"There's a thing between me and my mom and my stepfather and I have a friend, we all go out to dinner on a Friday night and we play Keno, and our number is four. I just happened to choose, and it worked to my advantage.\\" Lottery officials said Wanczyk chose to take a lump-sum payment of 480 million, or 336 million after taxes, the Associated Press reported, rather than a larger amount spread out over many annual payments. Wanczyk said the first thing she'll do is take some time off. \\"I just want to sit back and relax,\\" Wanczyk said. \\"I had a pipe dream, and my pipe dream has finally come true. I wanted to retire and it came early.\\" CBS Boston reports the store will get 50,000 for selling the winning ticket. This is the fourth time a Powerball jackpot winning ticket has been sold in Massachusetts. The others were sold in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Ahead of the press conference, Michael Sweeney, executive director of the Massachusetts lottery, called Wanczyk \\"a prototypical Massachusetts resident.\\" \\"My perception of her is someone who's a hard-working individual. Clearly she's excited,\\" Sweeney said. The winning numbers selected late Wednesday night were 6, 7, 16, 23, 26 and Powerball number 4. The 758 million prize reflects the annuity option, paid over 29 years. The odds of winning Wednesday night's drawing were 1 in 292.2 million. ||||| CLOSE A 53-year-old hospital worker and mom of two from Chicopee, Massachusetts, came forward to claim the 758 winning Powerball prize on Thursday Time Mavis L.

Early Thursday, however, the lottery agency had said the winning ticket was sold at a convenience store outside Boston. The initial announcement sent a flock of media to Handy Variety in Watertown.

State lottery Executive Director Michael Sweeney apologized for the confusion. He blamed a transcription error when officials manually recorded the dealers that sold the big winner and two other retailers that sold 1 million tickets. Bob Boduc, who owns the Chicopee store, said he didn't find out his store sold the ticket until he started getting calls from national networks. He said he would contribute the store's 50,000 to local charities.

To isolate r, we need to move the constant term, -212, to the other side of the equation. We do this by adding 212 to both sides: 0 + 212 = -53*r 212 = -53*r Step 3: Solve for r. To find the value of r, divide both sides of the equation by -53: 212 / -53 = (-53 * r) / -53 By dividing, we get: r ≈ -4 So, the solution for the given equation 0 = -53*r - 51 - 161 is r ≈ -4."},{"instruction":"– Frau Präsidentin, Herr Kommissar, meine Damen und Herren!

On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs. In his company he was known as Office Desk, because when he was working he always sat behind his well-used piece of conference table standing in a hard to notice corner in the software specialists' room. Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs for the 0-1 Computer Associates company. While the Man Called Office Desk (MCOD, or simply Cod in an alternative version) was writing an intuitive program for the management of empty office desk space in software companies, a thing that nobody had ever expected to happen happened. Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk. It would have been much more entertaining to watch, you could have laughed at him a little, and the nickname, given to him by the programmers' boss would have gotten a whole new meaning. And right now, there wasn't even much to talk about during cigarette breaks. Warm did not hide the fact he would have preferred to fuse with a mouse, or a mouse pad. Right now, all he could do was to pretend he totally ignored the fact he was physically stuck to a chair. And he was doing just fine until it was time to go to his second shift at 1-0 Computer Associates, where he had been working on a program for the management of empty space in staff lockers in telecommunications companies. What happened after Christopher fused? - not enough information - He pretended to ignore it - He joked about it - He started working on a new program Answer:","output":"He pretended to ignore it"},{"instruction":"Here's a question: One way to relieve your hunger if you live near the coast is to do what? Here are possible answers to this question: - grill - go to market - bring home fish - eat hamburger - make bread I believe the correct choice is \\"bring home fish\\", here's why: A:","output":"Living near the coast offers a unique and abundant source of fresh seafood that can be a sustainable and healthy way to relieve your hunger. Choosing \\"bring home fish\\" as the correct answer presents several advantages over the other options presented. First and foremost, fresh fish is readily available near coastal areas. You can access this rich source of food by either catching fish yourself or purchasing them from local fishermen or fish markets. This way, you can avoid transportation costs and the environmental impact associated with transporting fish from far-off locations. Moreover, fish is a highly nutritious food source. It is rich in high-quality protein, healthy omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals essential for maintaining good health. Consuming fish has been linked to numerous health benefits, including improved heart health, brain function, and even a reduced risk of certain diseases like stroke and certain types of cancer. In addition to being nutritious, fish is also a versatile and delicious food option. It can be prepared in various ways, such as grilling, baking, or steaming, offering diverse flavors and textures to suit individual preferences and dietary needs. Additionally, since many coastal communities have a long-standing tradition of fishing, you can take advantage of their culinary expertise and enjoy delicious seafood dishes that are part of the local gastronomy. In contrast, while the other options like grilling, going to market, eating a hamburger, or making bread can also address your hunger, they may not be as sustainable or healthy as consuming fresh fish. For instance, the meat in hamburgers often comes from livestock farming, which contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. On the other hand, baking bread requires energy and resources for wheat cultivation, milling, and transport, making it less environmentally friendly. Furthermore, consuming processed foods like hamburgers or store-bought bread may not provide the same level of nutrients as fresh fish. These foods might have higher levels of unhealthy fats, sugars, and preservatives, which can contribute to various health problems like obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. In conclusion, the choice of \\"bring home fish\\" is the correct and most sustainable answer to relieve your hunger when living near the coast. Not only does it provide a nutritious and versatile food source, but it also supports local fishermen, promotes the consumption of fresh and minimally processed food, and reduces the environmental impact associated with other food production methods. By choosing fresh fish, you can enjoy a delicious meal that benefits both your health and the environment."},{"instruction":"A man is traveling in a boat. A woman is cutting up a carrot with a knife. On a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", how closely does the first sentence resemble the second one?","output":"To evaluate the similarity between the two sentences, let's first break down their structure and meaning. The first sentence \\"A man is traveling in a boat\\" consists of the following elements: 1. The subject is a man. 2. The action being performed is traveling. 3. The object or means of performing the action is a boat. The second sentence \\"A woman is cutting up a carrot with a knife\\" consists of the following elements: 1. The subject is a woman. 2. The action being performed is cutting up a carrot. 3. The object or means of performing the action is a knife. Now, let's compare the elements of both sentences to determine the level of meaning overlap on a scale from 0 to 5. 1. Subjects: The first sentence has a man as the subject, while the second sentence has a woman. Although both are human beings, they represent different genders. This similarity is small, so we can rate this aspect as 1. 2. Actions: In the first sentence, the action is traveling, while in the second sentence, the action is cutting up a carrot. Traveling is related to movement and transportation, while cutting up a carrot is related to food preparation. These actions belong to completely different domains, so we can rate this aspect as 0. 3. Objects/means: In the first sentence, the means of performing the action is a boat, used for traveling on water. In the second, it is a knife, commonly used for cutting food items. Both objects are tools used for distinct purposes and belong to different domains, so we can rate this aspect as 0. To determine the overall similarity score, we will average the individual similarity scores: (1 + 0 + 0) / 3 = 0.33 Rounded to the nearest whole number, the overall similarity between the two sentences is 0 on a scale from 0 to 5. This indicates that there is essentially \\"no meaning overlap\\" between the two sentences."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine.

Mandela spent 27 years behind bars, serving time in multiple prison facilities, most notably Robben Island and Pollsmoor Prison. His imprisonment began in 1962 when he was arrested and convicted for incitement to strike and illegally leaving the country. He was serving a five-year sentence when he, along with several fellow members of the African National Congress (ANC), was convicted in the famous Rivonia Trial. In the trial, Mandela and other anti-apartheid campaigners faced charges of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government. Consequently, he was sentenced to life imprisonment on June 12, 1964. During his time in prison, Mandela became a symbol of resistance against apartheid and an international rallying point for those opposed to South Africa's racially discriminatory policies. Over the years, his stature increased, and the global demand for his release intensified. In the late 1980s, South Africa came under immense international pressure to avert a looming civil war within its borders. It was under the presidency of F.W. de Klerk that the South African government finally heeded the global call for Mandela's release. After 27 years of incarceration, Nelson Mandela was unconditionally released from Victor Verster Prison near Paarl. His release marked a turning point in South African history and was a massive step towards negotiating an end to apartheid. After his release, Mandela played a pivotal role in dismantling apartheid, leading negotiations between the ANC and the then-ruling National Party. These negotiations eventually culminated in South Africa's first multiracial, democratic elections in 1994. Running as the ANC's candidate, Mandela won the election and went on to become the first black president of South Africa, further cementing his place as an icon for racial equality and reconciliation."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Ride Ride Ride - Ride Ride Ride is the debut studio album by American country artist Lynn Anderson.

Solve this instance: proper question: What protein does Staphylococcus aureus produce to make antibodies ineffective? disfluent question: What protein does malaria no Staphylococcus aureus produce to make antibodies ineffective? context: An evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis). Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).

After days of indecision, the last two Democratic holdouts -- Sens. Blanche Lincoln (Ark.) and Mary Landrieu (La.) -- joined their caucus in supporting a motion to begin debate. The 60 to 39 vote marks a milestone in the decades-old quest for health-care reform, President Obama's top legislative priority. \\"The road to this point has been started many times,\\" Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said before the vote. \\"It has never been completed.\\" The debate is expected to last weeks. Reid is aiming for final passage by Christmas. The House passed a 1 trillion health bill two weeks ago; the 848 billion Senate version represents the work of two committees and hundreds of hours of hearings and deliberations, against a backdrop of fervent Republican opposition. But even as Democrats heralded their victory, they conceded that it represented the end of the beginning -- and not the other way around. Like Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.), a holdout until Friday, Lincoln and Landrieu said they will press Reid for further changes to the bill before committing to its final passage. Above all, the Democratic caucus remains bitterly divided over a government-run insurance option. Reid quelled an uprising by liberal senators weeks ago by adding a public option to the legislation. But although he included an opt-out clause for states, some moderates -- including Landrieu and Lincoln -- have told Reid they will oppose the Senate bill on final passage unless the provision is dropped. \\"My vote should in no way be construed by the supporters of this current framework as an indication of how I might vote on the final bill,\\" said Landrieu, adding that she also will seek more generous tax credits for small-business health care. For Democratic leaders, the weeks ahead are likely to bring additional concessions. Lawmakers are already requesting changes to the legislation, raising concerns related to Medicare, abortion and employer requirements. To secure support for Saturday's vote, Reid had to agree to a 72-hour review period that Lincoln sought after the bill was introduced Wednesday night. He added a Medicaid clause worth up to 300 million for Landrieu's home state. Although many Democrats pressed Reid to include language to end a federal antitrust exemption for health insurers, he omitted the repeal to lock down Nelson's vote. Republicans portrayed the vote as tantamount to an endorsement of the underlying bill, or \\"a vote for higher premiums, cuts to Medicare, and more taxes,\\" as Sen. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) declared. \\"All those people who are concerned about the high cost of health care today aren't getting relief under the Democrat plan,\\" said Sen. John Thune (S.D.). \\"In fact, their lives are going to get much, much worse.\\" But Democratic leaders said the vote provided a jolt of momentum that vastly improved prospects for a completed Senate bill before the Christmas break, leaving January for negotiations with the House. The goal now is to deliver final legislation to Obama in time for the State of the Union address in late January. Reid requested that senators vote from their chairs, a formality generally reserved for such historic matters as the confirmations of Supreme Court nominees. Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-Ohio) was not present and did not vote. Afterward, supporters of health-care reform gathered outside the Capitol to cheer Democratic lawmakers as they left the building. And a tearful Vicki Kennedy, widow of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), called Reid to applaud his efforts on her late husband's behalf. \\"We know not all 60 senators in my caucus agree on every aspect of this bill,\\" Reid told reporters. \\"But they agree on the vast, vast majority.\\" The Senate bill would provide coverage to 31 million uninsured Americans by vastly expanding Medicaid and creating insurance \\"exchanges\\" for individuals who do not have access to affordable coverage through their employers. For the first time, it would require most people to carry health coverage, although families with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level would receive subsidies to buy policies. The legislation would also force widespread changes to the insurance industry to end discriminatory practices, including the rejection of coverage based on preexisting conditions. It would provide new incentives to encourage disease prevention and to institute the most effective treatments for chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma. On the revenue side, the Senate bill would extract about 400 billion in cost savings from Medicare and Medicaid, and would impose an excise tax on the most generous health-care policies, dubbed \\"Cadillac\\" plans. It would raise payroll taxes for high earners and levy a 5 percent tax on elective cosmetic surgery. Even before he released the bill last week, Reid started work on securing the votes for Senate passage. He canvassed Democrats in private meetings and phone calls, and urged groups of senators with shared interests to work together on amendments. Leadership aides also drew up lists of potential Republican amendments to devise how Democrats would respond. Along with the three Democratic moderates who have stepped forward, two other senators are likely to become frequent visitors to Reid's office in the weeks ahead. Like Nelson, Landrieu and Lincoln, independent Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) opposes the public option but agreed to support the start of debate. Unlike the moderate Democrats, Lieberman has stated unequivocally that he would oppose a government insurance plan in any form. That leaves Reid with two options. Either he must persuade liberal lawmakers to give up the provision, or he must win back Olympia J. Snowe (Maine), the only Republican to support the Senate Finance Committee bill. Nelson, Landrieu and other moderate Democrats have suggested they can support an alternative version of the public option proposed by Snowe; it would take effect only if private policies prove unaffordable. Democrats are hopeful they can win her back as the debate advances and said she has continued to negotiate with Reid. But Snowe said, \\"The conversations have to translate into something specific . . . and that hasn't happened.\\" Staff writer Lori Montgomery contributed to this report. ||||| Sweeping health care legislation has cleared its first hurdle in the Senate on a party-line vote. The 60-39 vote clears the way for a historic debate after Thanksgiving on the legislation. The measure is designed to extend coverage to an estimated 31 million Americans who lack it and crack down on insurance industry practices that deny benefits. The vote came in a rare Saturday session in the Senate. Democrats posted 60 votes in a Senate showdown, precisely the number needed to overcome Republican delaying tactics. The vote was a major victory for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and the White House in a year-end drive to enact the most sweeping changes to the nation's health care system in a half-century or more. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. WASHINGTON (AP) _ Invoking the name of the late Edward M. Kennedy, Senate Democrats sealed a 60-vote majority needed to advance health care legislation Saturday ahead of an evening showdown with opposition Republicans eager to inflict a punishing defeat on President Barack Obama. Two final holdouts, Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, announced in speeches a few hours apart on the Senate floor that they would join in clearing the way for a bruising, full-scale health care debate after Thanksgiving. At a 10-year cost approaching 1 trillion, the measure is designed to extend coverage to roughly 31 million who lack it, crack down on insurance company practices that deny benefits and curtail the growth of spending on medical care nationally. \\"It is clear to me that doing nothing is not an option,\\" said Landrieu, who won 100 million in the legislation to help her state pay the costs of health care for the poor. Lincoln, who faces a tough re-election next year, said the evening vote will \\"mark the beginning of consideration of this bill by the U.S. Senate, not the end.\\" Both stressed they were not committing in advance to vote for the bill that ultimately emerges from next month's debate. Even so, their announcements marked a major victory for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and the White House in a year-end drive to enact the most sweeping changes to the nation's health care system in a half-century or more. While timing made Landrieu and Lincoln the final two Democrats to announce their intentions, Sen. Paul Kirk of Massachusetts had a clear claim as the 60th vote. Appointed to office this fall after the death of Kennedy, who championed health care issues for decades, Kirk said he spoke for those \\"who for so many years revered and loved and elected and re-elected (him)... that I think they're all _ they all, as we do, have him in our minds and our hearts tonight. ...\\" The legislation would require most Americans to carry insurance and provide subsidies to those who couldn't afford it. Large companies could incur costs if they did not provide coverage to their workforce. The insurance industry would come under significant new regulation under the bill, which would first ease and then ban the practice of denying coverage on the basis of pre-existing medical conditions. Congressional budget analysts put the legislation's cost at 979 billion over a decade and said it would reduce deficits over the same period while extending coverage to 94 percent of the eligible population. The House approved its version of the bill earlier this month on a near party line vote of 220-215, and Reid has said he wants the Senate to follow suit by year's end. Timing on any final compromise was unclear. In hours of debate before the Saturday evening vote, a few Republicans piled copies of the 2,074-page bill on their desks while others criticized it as a government takeover of health care and worse. \\"Move over, Bernie Madoff. Tip your hat to a trillion-dollar scam,\\" said Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., likening the bill's supporters to the imprisoned investor who fleeced millions. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said Reid had delayed implementation of many of the bill's key provisions and made it look less costly as a result. He put the true price tag at 2.5 trillion over a decade once implemented. \\"Senators who support this bill have a lot of explaining to do,\\" said the Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \\"Americans know that a vote to proceed on this bill is a vote for higher premiums, higher taxes and massive cuts to Medicare. That's a pretty hard thing to justify supporting.\\" That was a rebuttal to Landrieu and other Democrats who described the evening vote as one of procedure instead of substance. In her remarks, Landrieu said, \\"I've decided that there are enough significant reforms and safeguards in this bill to move forward, but much more work needs to be done.\\" She also touted the 100 million included in the legislation to help her state cover its costs under Medicaid, the state-federal health care program for the poor. \\"I'm proud to have fought for it. And I will continue to,\\" she said. Lincoln referred repeatedly to the political controversy surrounding the issue. She said 3.3 million has already been spent by outside groups advertising either for or against health care legislation, and said, \\"these outside groups seem to think that this is all about my re-election. I simply think they don't know me very well.\\" Health care figured prominently in Obama's campaign for the White House last year, and is likely to do so again in next fall's midterm elections. As a result, both parties seized on the debate. The Republican's Senate campaign committee lampooned the 100 million that Landrieu cited as a latter-day \\"Louisiana Purchase.\\" The Democratic National Committee countered that with their rhetoric, Republicans were \\"defending wasteful subsidies to health insurers\\" under private Medicare. Reid worked for weeks drafting the legislation, a blend of bills approved earlier by two committees with new provisions designed to straddle the ideological divide among Senate Democrats. Among the most controversial is a requirement for the government to sell insurance in competition with private industry, unless individual states opt out. Landrieu, Lincoln and other Democrats have expressed unease about it, and attempts to modify the so-called public option are certain once debate begins in earnest. One possibility would require the federal government stay out of the insurance business unless there was a shortage of competition or affordable coverage offered by private companies. At its core, the legislation would create insurance exchanges beginning in 2014 where individuals, most of them lower income and uninsured, would shop for coverage. The bill sets aside hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits to help those earning up to 400 percent of poverty, 88,200 for a family of four. To finance the expanded coverage, Reid proposed higher taxes as well as cuts totaling hundreds of billions of dollars in projected Medicare payments. Hardest hit would be the private insurance Medicare plans, although providers such as home health agencies would also receive significantly less in future years than now estimated. The bill raises payroll taxes on incomes over 200,000 for individuals and 250,000 for couples. Reid eased the impact of an earlier proposal to tax high-value insurance plans, which has emerged as one of the principal methods for restraining the growth in health costs. The bill includes tax increases on insurance companies, medical device makers, patients electing to undergo cosmetic surgery and drugmakers. ___ Associated Press writer Donna Cassata contributed to this article. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"On Saturday, the Senate voted along party lines to overcome a Republican filibuster and bring to the floor a bill that would overhaul the nation's health-care system.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - aquarium - creek - pet store - playground - pond The answer is:","output":"The most suitable option to answer the question \\"A colorful pebble falls on a goldfish, where is the pebble?\\" is the aquarium. An aquarium is a transparent container (usually made of glass or acrylic) filled with water, where aquatic plants and animals, such as goldfish, are kept for ornamental purposes or as pets. Goldfish are popular as pets because they are relatively low-maintenance, and they are commonly found in household aquariums. The other options provided are less suitable for the following reasons: 1. Creek: A creek is a small stream or a narrow body of water. While it is possible for goldfish to inhabit natural water bodies like creeks, the mention of a colorful pebble implies that the answer is likely in a controlled environment like an aquarium, where decorations such as colorful pebbles are commonly added. Also, creeks typically consist of naturally occurring rocks rather than colorful pebbles added for aesthetic purposes. 2. Pet store: A pet store is a place where various types of pets are sold, including goldfish. While it is possible that the pebble fell on a goldfish in a pet store, the question suggests a specific incident of a pebble falling on the fish. Since pebbles are typically found in a stable position within an aquarium that already houses the fish, it is less likely for this event to occur in a pet store setting. 3. Playground: A playground is an outdoor area designed for children's recreational activities, typically consisting of equipment such as swings, slides, and climbing structures. It is highly unlikely for a colorful pebble to fall on a goldfish in a playground, as these locations are not commonly associated with aquatic animals or their habitats. 4. Pond: A pond is a natural or artificial body of water that is smaller than a lake and is often shallow enough to support aquatic plants. While it is possible for goldfish to inhabit a pond, the mention of a colorful pebble suggests an environment that has been intentionally designed with such decorations, like an aquarium. Natural ponds are less likely to have colorful pebbles. Moreover, when people keep goldfish in ponds, these are often larger koi or other pond fish rather than small household goldfish. In conclusion, taking into account the likelihood of the scenario described and the presence of a colorful pebble, the most suitable answer is that the pebble is in an aquarium. This environment is specifically designed for keeping goldfish and other aquatic creatures as pets, and it is common for people to add decorative items such as colorful pebbles to enhance their appearance."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: It was a dream, then a place, then a memory.

We can do this by subtracting the smaller y term (75*y) from both sides of the equation. 75*y - 75*y = 82*y - 75*y + 28 This simplifies to: 0 = 7*y + 28 Step 2: Isolate the y term.

Details of Sollecito's secret trip to the grave emerged during an Italian TV programme to mark the sixth year anniversary of the murder in Perugia, and came just days before he is due to attend the retrial ordered by Italy's Supreme Court earlier this year. According to the programme Sollecito was taken to the cemetery at Coulsdon, Surrey, by an English friend of his while visiting London in March - at the same time as the retrial was announced. He did not ask for permission from Meredith's family and, according to the Quarto Grado show, 'said a silent prayer' for the British student but he did not leave any flowers. Knox, left, stunned the Kercher family saying that she hoped one day she could visit Kercher's grave. However Meredith's sister Stephanie Kercher, made it clear the family will not concede to her wish. Meredith had arrived in Perugia in September 2007 to study Italian as part of her University of Leeds course, and she had shared a house with Amanda Knox and two other women. The Kercher family have never accepted Sollecito and Knox's insistence they had nothing to do with Meredith's murder - the 20-year-old was found semi naked with her throat cut in her bedroom in the house she shared with Knox and two Italian women. In September Knox stunned the Kercher family with a bizarre request, saying that she hoped one day she could visit the final resting place of her friend. However in a statement Meredith's sister Stephanie Kercher made it clear the family will not concede to her wish, as she said: 'Her grave is now the safest place for her, she can rest in peace and be with us. I hope that is respected by everybody. 'It took five years for us to be ready as a family to bury Meredith, and even today it is still extremely painful. Now she has a place where we and her friends can go spend some time with her and take her some flowers. 'I hope that she can continue to rest. in peace, despite the judicial process still ongoing but, knowing Mez,. she will fight until the end. The 6th of November 2007 was the hardest day. of my life. I had to go to Italy to identify the body of my little. sister, stretched out cold and lifeless. 'I. would not wish that on anyone, it is something I will never forget. My. mother and I were the last ones to hug Mez that day, to let her know that. we were there and that we were there to bring her home.' Knox. and then boyfriend Sollecito were arrested and. charged five days after the murder in November 2007. At their initial. trial in 2009 they were convicted and sentenced to 26 years and 25 years. respectively. But two years later an appeal court sensationally overturned the original verdict and they were immediately freed, with Knox flying back to her home in Seattle - where she was given a hero's welcome - and Sollecito returning to his home in Bisceglie near Bari. However, it has since emerged that he has moved to the Caribbean island of the Dominican Republic - but his father has insisted he will return later this week to appear at the trial in Florence, where he is expected to make a formal statement to the court. Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito pictured outside the rented house in Perugia, Italy on November 2, 2007, the day after British student Meredith Kercher was murdered. Italian police surround the rented home in Perugia, Italy where Miss Kercher was discovered in November 2007 with her throat cut. Last week a fresh forensic report ordered by the court was leaked and it revealed that although Knox's DNA was on a knife believed to be the murder weapon, crucially there was no trace of Kercher or Sollecito on it. Sollecito's father Francesco said:'I have communicated the results to my son and naturally he is delighted. We have always said he had nothing to do with the death of poor Meredith. He is living in the Dominican Republic at the moment but he will return this week for the trial.' Mr Sollecito added he had 'no details' of his son's visit to the grave but said his son has always felt huge sympathy for the Kercher family for the loss of Meredith. Drifter Rudy Guede, 26, was convicted of murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith in 2008 and sentenced to 30 years but this was later reduced to 16 years and he could be released on parole by 2018. Highlights:","output":"- Raffaele Sollecito, accused of murdering student Meredith Kercher, secretly visited her grave. - The news may come as a shock to her family, who have asked Sollecito and Amanda Knox to stay away from the gravesite. - Sollecito and Knox are currently on trial for the brutal knife killing. - The visit occurred just days before Sollecito was due to attend the retrial ordered by Italy's Supreme Court. - Meredith's sister, Stephanie Kercher, has made it clear that the family will not allow Knox to visit the grave."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a context and four options.

So think first.","output":"To determine which sentence goes against common sense, let's examine each statement and its relationship to the topic of growing taller. Sentence A: \\"Drinking more milk will help you grow taller.\\" Milk contains calcium and other nutrients that are beneficial for bone health. While genetics play a significant role in determining height, having a balanced diet, including calcium intake, can contribute to reaching one's potential height. This statement aligns with common sense. Sentence B: \\"Drinking more water will help you grow taller.\\" Water is essential for overall health, but there is no direct relationship between drinking water and increased height growth. Water consumption can help with nutrient absorption, but it doesn't directly impact height.

The huge ship, which was considered an amazing technological achievement when it was launched in 1952, is owned by a preservationist group that says it will have \\"no choice but to negotiate the sale of the ship to a responsible recycler\\" unless a buyer or donor can start covering the cost of maintenance and mooring, which runs to a hefty 60,000 a month, the New York Times reports. The ship, which set a trans-Atlantic speed record on its maiden voyage that has never been beaten, is now at a Philadelphia dock, reports NPR, which calls the vessel \\"a symbol of America's postwar strength and pride.\\" The scrapyard would be a sad fate for the ship, but \\"we're not crying wolf,\\" the conservancy's director tells the Philadelphia Inquirer. \\"We've reached a point at which we are compelled to explore this 'negative outcome'\\" unless something changes before Oct. 31, she says. The firm that designed the 990-foot ship says it has come up with ideas for reuse including turning it into a hotel and spa or using it to house a tech company and its servers, reports the Times, which notes that when the SS United States was built, it was designed to quickly convert into a troopship capable of carrying 15,000 and its propellers were kept a state secret. (The ship involved in the CIA's \\"strangest mission of the Cold War\\" is going to be scrapped at an undisclosed location.) Expand this summary.","output":"The SS United States, a historic passenger liner launched in 1952, is at risk of being sold to a scrapyard unless a buyer or donor can help cover the cost of maintenance and mooring, warn its current owners, a preservationist group. The ship is considered a significant piece of American history and set an unbeaten trans-Atlantic speed record on its maiden voyage. It currently resides at a Philadelphia dock and costs approximately 60,000 a month for maintenance. The group emphasizes that they are not exaggerating the situation and will need to make a decision by October 31st. The SS United States was an incredible technological achievement during its time and has also come to symbolize America's postwar strength and pride. At 990 feet, the ship was designed for swift conversion into a troopship and could carry up to 15,000 soldiers. The ship's propellers were so advanced that they remained a state secret. The firm responsible for designing the ship has provided several ideas for repurposing the historical vessel, including converting it into a hotel and spa, or housing a tech company and its servers. These proposals highlight the potential for a valuable transformation that can extend the legacy of the SS United States. If a donor, buyer, or investor were to step forward and invest in the preservation and repurposing of the ship, it would serve as a crucial contribution to maintaining American history and the nation's maritime legacy. Additionally, repurposing the ship can help create economic opportunities, such as creating new jobs and stimulating tourism in the area where the vessel is ultimately anchored or permanently docked. Not only does the SS United States hold sentimental value as an impressive symbol of America's postwar strength, but its preservation and clever repurposing could also help generate revenue and safeguard an essential piece of the country's history. The crucial decision regarding the ship's fate is fast approaching, and supporters of the legendary passenger liner are hoping for a positive outcome that can prevent its journey to the scrapyard and give it a second life as a profitable and exciting venture."},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: earth, fly, space","output":"Our amazing Earth has lots of creatures that can fly in the sky, but when we want to go way up high into space, we need to use special machines called rockets!"},{"instruction":"the main relevant options for dnsmasq to network boot aptosid are to setup a path for the tftp server files and a file for it to boot from there.

One of the many areas affected by these circumstances was the production of essential materials, especially cotton and iron. In this article, we will assess the relative change in production volumes for cotton and iron during this time, shedding light on how these industries fared against each other. Ultimately, we seek to find the percentage difference in the decline of cotton production versus iron production. Methodology To make a fair comparison between the percentage declines in the production of cotton and iron during the pre-level war, we will: 1. Identify a common time frame in which both industries experienced a decline in production 2. Obtain accurate data for the production values of cotton and iron before and during the said time frame 3. Calculate the percentage decline in production for both industries 4. Determine the difference in percentage decline between cotton and iron production Results After identifying the relevant time frame and researching historical data sources for accurate production figures, we obtained the following production data for cotton and iron: 1. Time Frame: YYYY - YYYY (Years of the pre-level war era where both industries experienced a decline) 2. Cotton Production: a. Pre-decline Production Volume: X tons b. Decline Period Production Volume: Y tons 3. Iron Production: a. Pre-decline Production Volume: A tons b. Decline Period Production Volume: B tons Using these figures, we calculated the percentage decline in production for both cotton and iron: Percentage Decline (Cotton) = ((X-Y)/X) * 100 = C% Percentage Decline (Iron) = ((A-B)/A) * 100 = D% Now, we can determine the difference in percentage decline between cotton and iron production: Percentage Difference = C% - D% = E% Conclusion During the pre-level war era, the cotton industry experienced a decline of C% in production, while the iron industry saw a decrease of D%. As a result, the percentage decline in cotton production was E% more than that of iron production. This disparity between the two industries could be attributed to various factors, including market demands, supply chain disruptions, and the nature of the materials, among others. Ultimately, understanding this contrasting decline can offer valuable insights into how these essential industries adapted to the challenges and uncertainties of the pre-level war era."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Two gentlemen in tuxes play the keyboard and guitar.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"Two guys are playing instruments.\\" is true?

He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman who wrote a history of the events, considers that those present consisted of Gardstein, Smoller, Peters and Dubof, with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day, which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars.

Options: - suburbs - in the pond - residential area - newspaper - surface of earth The answer is \\"residential area\\" because","output":"the residential area is a section of a city where houses and apartments are primarily constructed for people to live in. Johnny initially wanted to build his house away from the city but still close enough, hinting that he prefers a quieter and more peaceful environment without being completely isolated. Despite giving up on that dream, he still wants the feel of a neighborhood that caters to residential living. Considering the given options: 1. Suburbs - Although suburbs are areas situated at the outskirts of a city and still have a sense of neighborhood living, Johnny decided to build inside the city limits, making this choice unsuitable. 2. In the pond - Building a house in a pond is impractical and not a common option for residential construction. Additionally, this doesn't fulfill his desire to have a house in a city. 3. Residential area - This is the most suitable option because it is a designated zone within a city specifically designed for residential living, meeting Johnny's preference of living inside the city limits. It also maintains a neighborhood feel and accommodates people looking for comfortable living spaces. 4. Newspaper - This is an irrelevant option, as a newspaper is a type of media and not a location to build a house. 5. Surface of Earth - While all construction occurs on the surface of the Earth, this option is too broad and doesn't address Johnny's specific requirement of living within the city limits. In conclusion, the best possible option for Johnny's house is the residential area, as it caters to his desire to build a home within the city limits while still providing a neighborhood atmosphere ideal for comfortable living."},{"instruction":"Question 1: Why is The Sandman called 'sandman'?

News reports suddenly emerge of a series of mysterious oil leaks on large commercial airplanes, leading to devastating accidents worldwide. As the leaks seem to be on the same model aircraft, major airlines urge the manufacturer for a solution, grounding the planes in question until the issue is resolved. However, the manufacturer seems unable to explain or rectify the problem. Act 2: In light of these accidents, Bill and Joe become increasingly concerned about the situation. They decide to conduct their own investigation. They manage to get their hands on a black box from one of the crashed planes, analyzing the data to determine the cause of these accidents. As they study the evidence, they begin to uncover a twisted plot: a well-orchestrated sabotage plan devised by a wealthy business mogul, Richard Kane, who seeks to monopolize the aviation industry by tarnishing the reputation of his competitors through these tragic accidents. In order to save their airline and the lives of countless passengers, Bill and Joe need to find a way to patch the oil leaks before another fatal accident occurs. Act 3: Our heroes formulate a risky plan. They will board one of the endangered aircraft as passengers, covertly surveilling the plane's systems in search of the oil leak. Using their knowledge and skills, they will attempt to repair it, even while facing the potential dangers of mid-flight sabotage. As the flight reaches its cruise altitude, the oil leak is detected in the plane's engine. Bill and Joe, with the help of the pilot, devise a makeshift tool using items and materials found on board.

Now think of the number 2^{2014} as a really, really big pile of apples. And 2^{2013} as another, but slightly smaller pile of apples.

How do some people become a terrorist?","output":"While the two questions appear similar on the surface, they are not entirely the same. They address the same topic, but their focus and nuances differ. Let us examine them individually to better understand their implications: 1. Why do people become terrorists? This question aims to identify the motives, reasons, and factors that drive individuals to engage in acts of terrorism. It seeks to understand the underlying forces that might lead a person to espouse violent ideologies and take part in terrorist activities. The reasons can be multifaceted, depending on the context, and could involve some of the following factors: - Political motivations: Some individuals might believe that their political aspirations can only be achieved through violence and terror. They could be frustrated with perceived marginalization or oppression, leading them to choose terrorism as a means of seeking change. - Ideological beliefs: Certain individuals may adopt radical ideologies that advocate violence and justify terrorism. These ideologies could stem from religious or other belief systems that prescribe a worldview hostile to others. - Social and psychological factors: People may be driven to terrorism due to feelings of isolation, alienation, or a sense of belonging to a marginalized group. In this context, terrorism could be perceived as a path to gain power and recognition and to address a perceived injustice. - Economic deprivation: Poverty, unemployment, and a lack of economic opportunities in some parts of the world can contribute to radicalization. Some individuals who feel economically deprived may turn to terrorism to improve their circumstances and seek resources. 2. How do some people become a terrorist? This question focuses more on the process through which a person transforms from an ordinary individual into a terrorist. It addresses the mechanisms, pathways, and environments that might enable or facilitate this transformation. Here are some ways in which this can occur: - Radicalization: The radicalization process is a key factor in understanding how people become terrorists. This process involves adopting an extreme perspective, often coupled with a belief that violence is the only way to achieve the desired outcome. Factors such as exposure to extremist propaganda, group dynamics, and personal grievances can all contribute to radicalization. - Recruitment and training: Terrorist organizations actively seek out new members, providing them with motivation, a sense of identity, and camaraderie. They may use various methods—including social media, peer groups, or even family connections—to recruit potential terrorists. Once the individual is drawn into their network, they are often provided with training and resources to prepare for and carry out acts of terror. - Exposure to conflict and violence: Some individuals may have firsthand experiences with armed conflict or violence. This exposure can desensitize them to violence and make the transition to terrorism more likely. Additionally, living in conflict zones may provide increased access to terrorist groups and resources. - Social networks and peer influence: The role of social connections and peer groups in the development of terrorists is significant. People may become terrorists by associating with like-minded individuals, friends, or family members who share extremist views. These interactions can foster a sense of allegiance to a cause or ideology and increase the likelihood of individuals engaging in violent acts. In summary, while both questions address the general issue of terrorism and its development, the first question pertains more to the reasons why people decide to become terrorists; the second question explores the pathways, mechanisms, and processes through which one transforms into a terrorist. Each question sheds light on different aspects of terrorism, and understanding both perspectives is crucial in analyzing and countering extremist behavior."},{"instruction":"Which Austrian was born first, Konrad Lorenz or Karl von Frisch?

A shopkeeper has just received a 2 kilogram box of chocolate. How many bars does this represent? Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a 2 kilogram box, we need to first convert the weights to the same unit. Since the weight of a chocolate bar is given in grams, we will convert the 2 kilograms to grams. We know that 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams. Therefore, 2 kilograms is equal to 2 * 1000 grams, which is 2000 grams. Now, we can find the number of chocolate bars by dividing the total weight of the box (2000 grams) by the weight of one chocolate bar (125 grams). Number of chocolate bars = 2000 grams / 125 grams = 16 bars This means that the 2 kilogram box contains 16 chocolate bars."},{"instruction":"Choose your story that continues the following story.

Solve 14*g - 113 = -255 + 198 for g.","output":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step for \\"g\\": The given equation is 14 * g - 113 = -255 + 198. Step 1: First, let's simplify the right side of the equation. -255 + 198 equals -57. So now our equation looks like this: 14 * g - 113 = -57 Step 2: Now, let's add 113 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\"g\\" in it. When we add 113 to -57, we get 56. So our equation is now: 14 * g = 56 Step 3: Finally, we need to find the value of \\"g\\". To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 14. When we divide 56 by 14, we get: g = 4 So, the solution to this math problem is g = 4."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Alright little one, let me explain this to you with a simple story!

Carl Muggli, 51, pleaded guilty in Koochiching County District Court to killing 61-year-old Linda Muggli in November 2010 at the couple's home south of International Falls. The husband had tried to convince authorities that the 700-pound pole accidentally fell out of a cradle and onto his wife of 24 years. But about a week after Linda Muggli's death, a tipster told the Sheriff's Office about Facebook entries between Muggli and a woman in Alabama that were \\"very intimate in nature.\\" Investigators also reported that they were unable to recreate the alleged accident. \\"This whole thing is a tragic occurrence,\\" defense attorney Charles Hawkins said Wednesday. He explained that his client chose to plead guilty to second-degree unintentional murder because \\"he did not want to put the family, his family or himself through any more misery.\\" Muggli had been charged with first-degree premeditated murder and second-degree intentional murder and his trial had been scheduled to begin Monday. He remains in the county jail awaiting sentencing on Feb. 4. Hawkins said Muggli faces a sentence of 12 1/2 to 15 years in prison, with the possibility of supervised release for the last third of that time. On Nov. 26, 2010, a sheriff's deputy called to the couple's garage found Linda Muggli on the floor, bleeding from the mouth but still breathing. She was taken to a hospital, where she died. Later that day, Carl Muggli told a deputy that a totem pole the couple had been working on fell out of its cradle and onto his wife. Agent found messages A state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) agent reviewed Muggli's computer and uncovered Facebook messages between him and the woman that stretched from more than a month before Linda Muggli's death to a few days afterward. \\"I love you with all my being. ... I want us together to live our lives as we seek. For I am with you. I am yours. We are one!\\" Muggli wrote to the woman he called \\"Eveningstar\\" the day before his wife's death. He also began sending e-mails to real estate companies in Texas, looking for a new place to live. On Nov. 30, a few hours after his wife's memorial service, Muggli sent the woman an online link for property in Palestine, Texas. He later moved to Stockdale. A month after Linda Muggli died, sheriff's deputies and an agent with the BCA went to the Muggli home in an effort to re-create the circumstances of the death as Carl Muggli had outlined. Each effort failed. Linda and Carl Muggli were married in 1986. They lived quietly in a log home south of International Falls in the town of Ray. Via the Internet, they made a name for themselves, carving and selling totem poles to Six Flags Theme Park, Warner Brothers Television and the Princess Diana Memorial Children's Park in London, according to their website.

And I was wondering Why did Lee do this?","output":"Based on the information you provided, it seems that Lee got a soda for their friend who was still working on the floor after their shift was over. There could be several reasons why Lee did this, and here are some possibilities: 1. Friendly gesture: Lee might simply be showing a friendly gesture by getting a soda for their friend who was still working. This kind of act can strengthen friendships and create a positive work environment. 2. Helping hand: Their friend might have been too busy or unable to take a break to get a soda themselves. Lee might have noticed their friend's situation and decided to lend a helping hand by getting the soda for them. 3. Favor or repayment: It's possible that Lee's friend had helped Lee before, and this was Lee's way to return the favor or show their gratitude. 4. Sharing discount or benefits: Lee might have had access to a discount or a benefit (e.g., employee discount) that their friend didn't have, so they used it to buy the soda for their friend. 5.

This is the story of Ben Phillips, who faced possibly the worst day of his life, ultimately to make a miraculous recovery that has inspired many and filled several with hope. Born with Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM), a condition that hides in the brain with a dormant nature, Ben Phillips lived his life unaware of the danger waiting to be unraveled. AVM is a rare phenomenon where an abnormal connection between arteries and veins bypasses the formation of capillaries, possibly leading to severe consequences if left undiscovered. Fate took an unfavorable turn when Ben suffered extensive bleeding on the brain due to the AVM while cray fishing. In a race against time, Ben's father, Simon, rushed him to the hospital. The news was devastating - doctors grimly informed the family that Ben would not live, a prospect no parent ever wishes to hear. His mother then accompanied him to Perth, making arrangements to donate his organs and preparing to say goodbye to her beloved son. But just like in a scene from a movie, Ben, against all odds, miraculously responded to a nurse's touch in a testament to the incredible resilience of the human spirit. This unexpected and shocking turn of events offered a glimmer of hope in an otherwise dark time for Ben and those who cared about him. The following months were nothing less than a roller coaster ride of emotions. With unwavering faith and determination, Ben embarked on the strenuous journey to reclaim his life. Overcoming challenges one day at a time, he kept pushing himself to recover and proved to the world that the impossible could be made possible. Slowly but surely, Ben Phillips emulated the story of a real-life superhero - emerging as an inspiration to many. Today, he is back in the water, doing what he loves the most. Medical experts are now optimistic about his eventual full recovery, something that once seemed impossible in the face of such adversity. In a world where we often hear stories of struggle and despair, Ben Phillips' miraculous recovery serves as a reminder of our innate capacity to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. It is a beacon of hope, encouraging us to believe in the power of our resilience and determination.

In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics where abstract concepts are studied for their own sake. The activity of applied mathematics is thus intimately connected with research in pure mathematics. - Mathematical analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with limits and related theories, such as differentiation, integration, measure, infinite series, and analytic functions. - Thermodynamics is a branch of science concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work. The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics, irrespective of the composition or specific properties of the material or system in question. The laws of thermodynamics are explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics. Thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering, especially physical chemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering. - In mathematics, analytic combinatorics is one of the many techniques of counting combinatorial objects. It uses the internal structure of the objects to derive formulas for their generating functions and then complex analysis techniques to get asymptotics. This particular theory was mostly developed by Philippe Flajolet, and is detailed in his book with Robert Sedgewick, \\"Analytic Combinatorics\\". Earlier contributors to the key ideas and techniques include Leonhard Euler, Arthur Cayley, Srinivasa Ramanujan, George Pólya, and Donald Knuth. - Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials. Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros. - Number theory or, in older usage, arithmetic is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers. It is sometimes called \\"The Queen of Mathematics\\" because of its foundational place in the discipline. Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g., rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (e.g., algebraic integers). - Simion Stoilow or Stoilov ( 14 September ( O.S. 2 September ) 1873 -- 4 April 1961 ) was a Romanian mathematician , creator of the Romanian school of complex analysis , and author of over 100 publications . - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - Electrical engineering is a field of engineering that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electric power distribution and use. Subsequently, broadcasting and recording media made electronics part of daily life. The invention of the transistor, and later the integrated circuit, brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object. - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. - Complex analysis, traditionally known as the theory of functions of a complex variable, is the branch of mathematical analysis that investigates functions of complex numbers. It is useful in many branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, number theory, analytic combinatorics, applied mathematics; as well as in physics, including hydrodynamics and thermodynamics and also in engineering fields such as nuclear, aerospace, mechanical and electrical engineering. - A mathematical problem is a problem that is amenable to being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with the methods of mathematics. This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.<br> It can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox. - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'simion stoilow' exhibits the relationship of 'field of work'. Find the answer from the choices below.

Lounging and reading books alone while in retirement came easily to Megan but not Jennifer because","output":"Jennifer was a highly extroverted individual who thrived on social interaction, engaging in various activities, and meaningful conversations with others throughout her life. As she navigated her way through her retirement years, Jennifer found it significantly challenging to adapt to the idea of spending her days in quiet solitude like her friend Megan, immersing herself in the world of literature. This undeniable contrast in their dispositions and preferences had deep roots in their upbringing, personalities, and life experiences. Growing up, Jennifer was always surrounded by a large group of friends, her boisterous family, and an endless array of social events that filled her calendar. This environment allowed her to develop exceptional communication skills, strong interpersonal relationships, and a keen sense of empathy. In contrast, Megan was an introvert who was content spending time alone, cherishing her books as an escape into fascinating realms full of wonder and intrigue. As both friends reached retirement, Megan effortlessly continued this practice, embracing the tranquility and peace that came with the absence of everyday responsibilities and distractions. In an attempt to adjust to her new-found freedom, Jennifer found herself lacking the sense of satisfaction and fulfillment that she once derived from her interactions with her peers and colleagues in her younger years. The absence of companionship left her feeling discontent and somewhat isolated. The reality of Jennifer's retirement proved to be quite different from her expectations. She had imagined days filled with travel, forming new friendships within communities of fellow retirees, and perhaps even engaging in various volunteering activities that would allow her to give back to society while remaining active and connected to others. As Jennifer observed Megan's ability to find solace and contentment in her solitary pursuits, she realized that adopting a similar approach to retirement might not be the most suitable course of action for her. Despite her numerous attempts to sit back, relax and get lost within the pages of a book, Jennifer could not shake the innate longing for social engagement that had defined her entire existence. Recognizing that retirement should not signify the end of her vibrant social life, Jennifer decided to explore various avenues that would enable her to maintain her extroverted tendencies while adapting to her new-found freedom. She began attending local workshops and classes in diverse subjects that genuinely intrigued her, such as photography, painting, and even dancing. These activities not only facilitated her continued self-development but also provided her with a sense of accomplishment and opportunities to form meaningful connections with others who shared her interests. Moreover, Jennifer opted to dedicate some of her time volunteering in social outreach programs – a perfect avenue for her inherent empathetic personality and her desire to foster authentic bonds with others. By exploring these alternative pathways, Jennifer discovered that retirement could also translate into the inception of countless opportunities to discover uncharted territories of self-growth and new connections. In essence, retirement for Jennifer and Megan, while starkly different, offered both women unique ways to flourish in the final chapters of their lives. In conclusion, while the worlds of Megan and Jennifer seemed incompatible at a glance, both women uncovered their distinct ways to navigate and embrace their retirement years. It evidenced that individual preferences, personalities, and life experiences play a crucial role in determining the most fulfilling retirement journey, as diverse as the people themselves."},{"instruction":"Question: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. Two groups of students learned about protozoa for a school project.

Little information is available about who sang the various roles in the first performance. A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer Francesco Rasi took part, and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role. Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges \\"with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling\\". The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato, Giovanni Gualberto Magli, is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes. Magli sang the prologue, Proserpina and possibly one other role, either La messaggera or Speranza. The musicologist and historian Hans Redlich mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo.A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to \\"that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince's Orfeo\\". This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo Bacchini, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits. Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows, a total of ten singers—three sopranos, two altos, three tenors and two basses—is required for a performance, with the soloists (except Orfeo) also forming the chorus. Carter's suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza. answer the following question: What is the last name of the scholar that believes role-doublings were used in the performance of the Montverdi piece?","output":"The last name of the scholar who believes role-doublings were used in the performance of the Monteverdi piece is Carter."},{"instruction":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Michele Marcolini, birthPlace, Italy.

He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \\"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, \\"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble\\". A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.

Dennis Farrell keeps in his cabin a memento of the last time the storied Navy destroyer cruised into New York Harbor. It was Fleet Week 2000. Sailors stood at the rails under a fluttering American flag. In the background, the Twin Towers soared over a shimmering skyline. \\"It reminds me of why we go to sea,\\" Farrell says of the keepsake photo. A few months later, on October 12, 2000, a pair of suicide bombers associated with al Qaeda nearly sank the Cole as it refueled in Aden harbor in Yemen. The attackers waved at the sailors. \\"It was presumed to be a trash boat,\\" Farrell says. \\"It wasn't.\\" Resilient and strong. The bombers sidled their explosives-laden fishing boat alongside the 1 billion warship and ripped a 40-by-60-foot hole into its side, killing 17 sailors and wounding 37 more. Heralded by al Qaeda as one of its greatest military strikes, the attack foreshadowed the terror network's destruction of the World Trade Center in Manhattan less than a year later. \\"We took a hit 11 months before 9/11, and we came back resilient, a strong force,\\" Farrell says, \\"like the men and women of New York.\\" The destroyer -- also known as DDG 67 -- left New York on Tuesday at the close of Fleet Week 2014. The World Trade Center site, with its hulking Freedom Tower, once again houses the nation's tallest building. On Wednesday, the same day the Cole headed the Fleet Week procession along the harbor, the long-awaited September 11 Memorial Museum opened to the public. A flotilla of smaller vessels, including New York Police and Fire Department boats, welcomed the ships. \\"We're so closely connected to the men and women of New York,\\" says Farrell, a native of Boca Raton, Florida. \\"You see the outpouring of the emergency service members, the firefighters and the New York City Police Department.\\" In recent days, hundreds of schoolchildren and adults toured the Cole to learn about its history, weapons systems and return to duty two years and 250 million in repairs and upgrades after the attack. \\"Right here is where the gash was,\\" says U.S. Navy Ensign Hannah Taylor of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, standing near where 17 sailors having an early lunch were killed.

Another, the flag that draped the coffins of the fallen crew members. A third holds the flag flown when the ship first returned to the Gulf of Aden. Courage and Heroism. In 2001, the Department of Defense issued a report on the USS Cole attack that cited significant shortcomings in security against terrorist attacks. \\"The investigation clearly shows that the commanding officer of Cole did not have the specific intelligence, focused training, appropriate equipment or on-scene security support to effectively prevent or deter such a determined, preplanned assault,\\" the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Vern Clark, said at the time. \\"In short, the system -- all of us -- did not equip this Skipper for success in the environment he encountered in Aden harbor that fateful day.\\" The terror organization's success against the Cole \\"galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts,\\" while the failure of the United States to retaliate against group leaders in Afghanistan motivated Osama bin Laden to \\"launch something bigger,\\" said the 9/11 Commission Report. Still, those stationed on the Cole speak of the heroism of members of the former crew, who worked for days to save the ship and care for the injured. In intense heat, they toiled without electrical power and no shipboard communication. \\"On two occasions, it was very, very close to sinking,\\" Farrell says. \\"The ship had to pull together everybody regardless of what their specialty was ... for damage control.\\" He added, \\"There is no question that this ship was saved by the men and women who were serving on the Cole in October 2000. That's not lost on me or any of my crew members. We stand on the shoulders of those who came before us.\\" All Navy recruits now undergo drills on the same type of ship as the Cole, putting out fires, dealing with flooding and tending to the wounded. Exercises occur in a structural model of the damaged Cole mess deck. \\"We have a totally different mindset of how we do business, a totally different focus,\\" Farrell says.

To provide a more detailed and long answer to this question, it is essential to explain the origin, expansion, and eventual decline of the Western Kshatrapas. The Western Kshatrapas, also known as the Western Satraps or Saka Satraps, were a dynasty of Indo-Scythian rulers who controlled a large area in northwestern and western India during the 1st to 4th centuries CE. They were descendants of the Indo-Scythians, who migrated from the Central Asian region and settled in the Indian subcontinent in the 2nd century BCE. The Western Kshatrapas were established as a power in northwestern India after the Indo-Scythians invaded the region, specifically the area of Ujjain, around 78 CE. The Saka era, which begins in the year 78 CE and is still used as a calendar by some regions in India, marks the ascendance of the Western Kshatrapas. The Western Kshatrapas expanded their realm over the next few centuries, controlling significant territories that included the present-day Indian states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and parts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Their rule was characterized by the rise of trade, the patronage of Buddhist monastic institutions, the development of rock-cut architecture, and the minting of their own coins featuring the figures of their rulers. The Western Kshatrapas held power for about three centuries, from approximately 78 CE to around 395 CE. During this time, they faced several of their neighboring powers, most notably the powerful Gupta Empire to the north. The decline of the Western Kshatrapas began in the late 3rd century CE when they started to lose territories to the growing Gupta Empire. The end of the Western Kshatrapas rule came in 395 CE when the last ruler, Rudrasena III, was defeated by the Gupta Emperor Chandragupta II. Consequently, the territory once controlled by the Western Kshatrapas was annexed to the Gupta Empire, and the Western Kshatrapas dynasty was dissolved. In conclusion, the Western Kshatrapas were in power for a period of approximately 317 years, from 78 CE to 395 CE. Their rule began with the Indo-Scythian invasion of Ujjain and the establishment of the Saka era and ended with the defeat and annexation by the Gupta Empire."},{"instruction":"Summarize: A dutch oven or high-sided cast iron pan are your best bets, as they retain heat well and have big sides to prevent splattering oil. This is cold oil, not hot, as this process heats up the oil and fries simultaneously. This simulates the double-fry method mentioned above. As the oil heats up it leaches moisture from the potato, which allows the later heat (once the oil is up to temperature) to actually fry the chip. The oil will begin to bubble up around the fries, which is a good sign. These bubbles aren't actually oil, but escaping water molecules. You should be able to easily pierce the potatoes with a fork. This means they've softened enough to really start frying. The bubbling in the oil should crank up significantly, and after 20-25 minutes you should notice that the fries are starting to get golden brown and delicious looking. A few more minutes and they'll be perfect. Remove the fries from the hot oil with a slotted spoon or wire strainer, then pat dry with paper towels. Don't let excess oil stick around -- it leads to soggy fries. Once you're done patting, season liberally with salt and serve.","output":"The text describes the process of preparing french fries using a dutch oven or a high-sided cast iron pan, which are ideal due to their heat retention capabilities and large sides that prevent oil splattering. The oil used is initially cold, and the process of heating the oil occurs simultaneously with frying the potatoes. This mimics the double-fry technique, which is highly regarded for making perfect fries. As the oil warms, it extracts moisture from the potatoes, which is a crucial step as it allows the high temperature (once the oil is fully heated) to effectively fry the fries. Indication of this process can be seen when the oil forms bubbles around the fries. These bubbles though, are not oil but are rather water molecules that are escaping from the fries. An important milestone in the process is when the fries become soft enough to be easily pierced using a fork. This signifies that the fries have softened sufficiently to start frying in earnest. At this stage, the bubbling of the oil will increase noticeably. After approximately 20 to 25 minutes of frying, the fries will start to turn golden brown, indicating they are nearly ready. A few additional minutes, the fries should be perfectly cooked. The removal of the fries from the hot oil is done using a tool that will not hold onto the oil, such as a slotted spoon or wire strainer. The fries are then pat dried with paper towels to get rid of any excess oil as this could result in the fries becoming soggy. The final stage of the preparation involves liberal seasoning of the fries with salt, after which they are ready to be served. The steps outlined not only guide how to make fries, but also explain the scientific process happening during the frying process - from dehydration during heating of the fries, through bubbling of escaping water molecules, to the eventual deep frying of the fries."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Title: Disappointed Review: I read the other reviews, but should have really taken them to heart.

Knicks GM Scott Perry (left) and team president Steve Mills (center) have plenty of decisions to make. (Steve Freeman/NBAE/Getty Images) Knicks president Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry are in no rush to shake up the roster with the trade deadline looming next week. And honestly there isn't a lot the Knicks can do. They'd love to move Joakim Noah but unless they attach a first-round pick to any Noah deal â which they won't â a trade involving the veteran center is unlikely. Once Mills replaced Jackson and subsequently hired Perry everything that happens with the Knicks is now on them. Understandably they don't want to give off the impression that they don't have control of the situation and of the players. Mills knows Knicks history and Dolan as well as anyone. Thus he proceeds with caution. Even though Mills isn't at fault here it 's important for him to give off the impression that the front office has this Noah situation under control. Again smart move. If you go back to last summer Mills didn't rush into trading Carmelo Anthony and in fact vetoed the deal Jackson had made with the Houston Rockets. Instead Mills and Perry waited until the 11th hour to make a trade with Oklahoma City. Their patience was rewarded. Carmelo and OKC have certainly found their form but Enes Kanter has been a solid addition to the Knicks.","output":"To determine if the sentiment towards Steve Mills is neutral in the given document, I will analyze the text step-by-step: 1. The first mention of Steve Mills is when talking about the decisions the Knicks management has to make. This statement is neutral. 2.

The document mentions that Mills knows Knicks history and proceeds with caution. This is a neutral statement. 4. The text says that Mills is not at fault in the Noah situation and it is important for him to show control of the situation. This statement is neutral. 5.

Answer: Yes"},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: Early Islamic philosophy and Islamic metaphysics, imbued as it is with Islamic theology, distinguishes more clearly than Aristotelianism between essence and existence. Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn Sīnā, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from Occasionalism can be seen in what is left of his work. Who does Ibn Sina's philosophy owe much to?","output":"Ibn Sina's philosophy, particularly in the realm of metaphysics, owes much to the earlier Persian philosopher al-Farabi. Al-Farabi was a highly influential thinker in the Islamic philosophical tradition who played a crucial role in integrating Greek philosophical ideas, such as those from Aristotle and Plato, into Islamic thought. Ibn Sina, also known as Avicenna in the Western world, was deeply influenced by al-Farabi's works and further developed his ideas, thus contributing significantly to the evolution of Islamic philosophy. Al-Farabi is often referred to as the 'Second Master', after Aristotle, in the Islamic philosophical tradition. His works not only focused on metaphysics but also on various other fields, such as ethics, political philosophy, and logic. Through his extensive writings and teachings, al-Farabi established a firm foundation for those who would come after him, particularly Ibn Sina, to build upon and expand their own philosophical thoughts. Ibn Sina, a pivotal figure in the Islamic Golden Age, drew extensively from the works of both al-Farabi and other Greek philosophers to develop his metaphysical ideas. In his famous work, 'The Book of Healing', Ibn Sina attempted to reconcile the ideas of Aristotle and the Islamic theological tradition. He introduced several key concepts that differentiated Islamic philosophy from Aristotle's thoughts, including the distinction between essence and existence, as mentioned in the article. Ibn Sina's reliance on al-Farabi's contributions to Islamic philosophy is evident in the way he explored the topics of metaphysics, God, and the nature of existence. He further refined and extrapolated upon al-Farabi's ideas to develop his own theories on this subject matter. For instance, Ibn Sina introduced the concept of the \\"necessary being\\", which is an entity whose existence is necessary for all other contingent beings to exist. This concept was a groundbreaking idea in Islamic metaphysics and had lasting impacts on both Islamic and Western philosophical thought. In conclusion, Ibn Sina's philosophy, particularly as it pertains to metaphysics, is heavily indebted to the works and ideas of al-Farabi. By building upon and further developing al-Farabi's philosophical foundations, Ibn Sina made significant contributions to the evolution of Islamic philosophy and its integration with the Greek intellectual tradition. As such, these thinkers played an essential role in shaping the diverse and rich heritage of Islamic philosophical thought."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Brian asked if he could eat all of Aaron 's crab cake, because Brian hated the taste of sea insects. 2. Brian asked if he could eat all of Aaron 's crab cake, because Aaron hated the taste of sea insects. Now let's evaluate both choices step-by-step: Step 1: Determine the main subject. In this case, Brian is the main subject since he is asking to eat Aaron's crab cake. Step 2: Determine what actions are aligned with the main subject.

Stan Lee, the legendary writer, editor and publisher of Marvel Comics whose fantabulous but flawed creations made him a real-life superhero to comic book lovers everywhere, has died. He was 95. Lee, who began in the business in 1939 and created or co-created Black Panther, Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Mighty Thor, Iron Man, the Fantastic Four, the Incredible Hulk, Daredevil and Ant-Man, among countless other characters, died early Monday morning at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, a family representative told The Hollywood Reporter. Kirk Schenck, an attorney for Lee's daughter, J.C. Lee, also confirmed his death to the Associated Press. Lee's final few years were tumultuous. After Joan, his wife of 69 years, died in July 2017, he sued executives at POW! Entertainment — a company he founded in 2001 to develop film, TV and video game properties — for 1 billion alleging fraud, then abruptly dropped the suit weeks later. He also sued his ex-business manager and filed for a restraining order against a man who had been handling his affairs. (Lee's estate is estimated to be worth as much as 70 million.) And in June 2018, it was revealed that the Los Angeles Police Department had been investigating reports of elder abuse against him. On his own and through his work with frequent artist-writer collaborators Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and others, Lee catapulted Marvel from a tiny venture into the world's No. 1 publisher of comic books and, later, a multimedia giant. In 2009, The Walt Disney Co. bought Marvel Entertainment for 4 billion, and most of the top-grossing superhero films of all time — led by Avengers: Infinity War's 2.05 billion worldwide take earlier this year — have featured Marvel characters. \\"I used to think what I did was not very important,\\" he told the Chicago Tribune in April 2014. \\"People are building bridges and engaging in medical research, and here I was doing stories about fictional people who do extraordinary, crazy things and wear costumes. But I suppose I have come to realize that entertainment is not easily dismissed.\\" Lee's fame and influence as the face and figurehead of Marvel, even in his nonagenarian years, remained considerable. “Stan Lee was as extraordinary as the characters he created,\\" Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger said in a statement. \\"A superhero in his own right to Marvel fans around the world, Stan had the power to inspire, to entertain and to connect. The scale of his imagination was only exceeded by the size of his heart.\\" Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige also paid tribute. “No one has had more of an impact on my career and everything we do at Marvel Studios than Stan Lee,\\" Feige said. \\"Stan leaves an extraordinary legacy that will outlive us all. Our thoughts are with his daughter, his family and the millions of fans who have been forever touched by Stan’s genius, charisma and heart. Excelsior!” Beginning in the 1960s, the irrepressible and feisty Lee punched up his Marvel superheroes with personality, not just power. Until then, comic book headliners like those of DC Comics were square and well-adjusted, but his heroes had human foibles and hang-ups; Peter Parker/Spider-Man, for example, fretted about his dandruff and was confused about dating. The evildoers were a mess of psychological complexity. \\"His stories taught me that even superheroes like Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk have ego deficiencies and girl problems and do not live in their macho fantasies 24 hours a day,\\" Gene Simmons of Kiss said in a 1979 interview. \\"Through the honesty of guys like Spider-Man, I learned about the shades of gray in human nature.\\" (Kiss made it to the Marvel pages, and Lee had Simmons bleed into a vat of ink so the publisher could say the issues were printed with his blood.) The Manhattan-born Lee wrote, art-directed and edited most of Marvel's series and newspaper strips. He also penned a monthly comics column, “Stan's Soapbox,” signing off with his signature phrase, “Excelsior!” His way of doing things at Marvel was to brainstorm a story with an artist, then write a synopsis. After the artist drew the story panels, Lee filled in the word balloons and captions. The process became known as “The Marvel Method.” Lee collaborated with artist-writer Kirby on the Fantastic Four, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Silver Surfer and X-Men. With artist-writer Ditko he created Spider-Man and the surgeon Doctor Strange, and with artist Bill Everett came up with the blind superhero Daredevil. Such collaborations sometimes led to credit disputes: Lee and Ditko reportedly engaged in bitter fights, and both receive writing credit on the Spider-Man movies and TV shows. \\"I don't want anyone to think I treated Kirby or Ditko unfairly,\\" he told Playboy magazine in April 2014. \\"I think we had a wonderful relationship. Their talent was incredible. But the things they wanted weren't in my power to give them.\\" Like any Marvel employee, Lee had no rights to the characters he helped create and received no royalties. In the 1970s, Lee importantly helped push the boundaries on censorship in comics, delving into serious and topical subject matter in a medium that had become mindless, kid-friendly entertainment. In 1954, the publication of psychologist Frederic Wertham's book Seduction of the Innocent had spurred calls for the government to regulate violence, sex, drug use, questioning of public authority figures, etc., in the comics as a way to curtail \\"juvenile delinquency.\\" Wary publishers headed that off by forming the Comics Code Authority, a self-censoring body that while avoiding the heavy hand of Washington still wound up neutering adult interest in comics and stereotyping the medium as one only kids would enjoy. Lee scripted banal scenarios with characters like Nellie the Nurse and Tessie the Typist, but in 1971, he inserted an anti-drug storyline into \\"The Amazing Spider-Man” in which Peter Parker's best friend Harry Osborn popped pills. Those issues, which did not carry the CCA \\"seal of approval\\" on the covers, became extremely popular, and later, the organization relaxed some of its guidelines. Born Stanley Martin Lieber on Dec. 28, 1922, he grew up poor in Washington Heights, where his father, a Romanian immigrant, was a dress-cutter. A lover of adventure books and Errol Flynn movies, Lee graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, joined the WPA Federal Theatre Project, where he appeared in a few stage shows, and wrote obituaries. In 1939, Lee got a job as a gofer for 8 a week at Marvel predecessor Timely Comics. Two years later, for Kirby and Joe Simon's Captain America No. 3, he wrote a two-page story titled \\"The Traitor's Revenge!\\" that was used as text filler to qualify the company for the inexpensive magazine mailing rate. He used the pen name Stan Lee. He was named interim editor at 19 by publisher Martin Goodman when the previous editor quit. In 1942, he enlisted in the Army and served in the Signal Corps, where he wrote manuals and training films with a group that included Oscar-winner Frank Capra, Pulitzer-winner William Saroyan and Theodor Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss). After the war, he returned to the publisher and served as the editor for decades. Following DC Comics' lead with the Justice League, Lee and Kirby in November 1961 launched their own superhero team, the Fantastic Four, for the newly renamed Marvel Comics, and Hulk, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Daredevil and X-Men soon followed. The Avengers launched as its own title in September 1963. Perhaps not surprisingly, Manhattan's high-literary culture vultures did not bestow its approval on how Lee was making a living. People would “avoid me like I had the plague. … Today, it's so different,” he once told The Washington Post. Not everyone felt the same way, though. Lee recalled once being visiting in his New York office by Federico Fellini, who wanted to talk about nothing but Spider-Man. In 1972, Lee was named publisher and relinquished the Marvel editorial reins to spend all his time promoting the company. He moved to Los Angeles in 1980 to set up an animation studio and to build relationships in Hollywood. Lee purchased a home overlooking the Sunset Strip that was once owned by Jack Benny's announcer, Don Wilson. Long before his Marvel characters made it to the movies, they appeared on television. An animated Spider-Man show (with a memorable theme song composed by Oscar winner Paul Francis Webster, of \\"The Shadow of Your Smile\\" fame, and Bob Harris) ran on ABC from 1967 to 1970. Bill Bixby played Dr. David Banner, who turns into a green monster (Lou Ferrigno) when he gets agitated, in the 1977-82 CBS drama The Incredible Hulk. And Pamela Anderson provided the voice of Stripperella, a risque animated Spike TV series that Lee wrote for in 2003-04. Lee launched the internet-based Stan Lee Media in 1998, and the superhero creation, production and marketing studio went public a year later. However, when investigators uncovered illegal stock manipulation by his partners, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001. (Lee was never charged.) In 2002, Lee published an autobiography, Excelsior! The Amazing Life of Stan Lee. Survivors include his daughter and younger brother Larry Lieber, a writer and artist for Marvel. Another daughter, Jan, died in infancy. His wife, Joan, was a hat model whom he married in 1947. Like Alfred Hitchcock before him, the never-bashful Lee appeared in cameos in the Marvel movies, shown avoiding falling concrete, watering his lawn, delivering the mail, crashing a wedding, playing a security guard, etc. In Spider-Man 3 (2007), he chats with Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker as they stop on a Times Square street to read news that the web-slinger will soon receive the key to the city. “You know,\\" he says, \\"I guess one person can make a difference … 'nuff said.” Duane Byrge and Borys Kit contributed to this report. ||||| Stan Lee Dead at 95 Marvel Comics Legend Stan Lee Dead at 95 EXCLUSIVE Stan Lee, the man responsible for much of the Marvel Universe, has died ...

In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years. - DVD (an abbreviation of \\"digital versatile disc\\" or \\"digital video disc\\") is a digital optical disc storage format invented and developed by Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Panasonic in 1995.

Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. - The Cleveland Show is an American adult animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane, Richard Appel, and Mike Henry for the Fox Broadcasting Company as a spin-off of \\"Family Guy\\".

One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D. But I can use this background: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. What is an answer for this question: Which field would have lower potential energy, field C or field D? The answer is:","output":"Field D would have lower potential energy. This is because electric charges, in this case, negative charges A and B, move spontaneously from a position of higher potential energy to a position of lower potential energy. As they are moving from field C to field D, it can be inferred that field D has lower potential energy than field C. This movement is similar to water falling over a dam, going from an area of higher potential energy (upstream) to an area of lower potential energy (downstream)."},{"instruction":"Which is an appropriate title for this article?

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"If more boilers are added, this could potentially lead to several possible effects on the process of forest formation, depending on the context of where these boilers are located and how they are utilized. Some potential scenarios include: 1. If the boilers are added within or near the forest, they may require the consumption of trees as fuel, resulting in deforestation. This could negatively affect the process of forest formation, as fewer trees would be available for producing and dispersing seeds. 2. The addition of more boilers could result in greater air pollution, especially if they burn fossil fuels or other materials that release greenhouse gases and pollutants. Increased air pollution could affect tree growth, seed dispersion, and overall forest health, potentially leading to decreased forest formation. 3. The boilers could generate excess heat, which might have an indirect effect on local climate in the area surrounding the forest. If the climate becomes warmer or drier, it could have a negative impact on tree growth and seed production, making it difficult for the forest to regenerate and expand. 4. If the additional boilers are part of industrial or urban expansion, this could lead to further loss of habitat for trees, as well as disruptions to seed-dispersing species such as animals and birds. This, in turn, could negatively impact the process of forest formation. Overall, the addition of more boilers could potentially have both direct and indirect negative effects on the process of forest formation, depending on the specific context and circumstances in which they are added. To minimize these negative effects, sustainable practices should be implemented regarding the use of boilers, including the use of renewable energy sources, efficient design, and proper emissions control measures."},{"instruction":"Read this article and answer this question As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 88,737 people, 30,873 households, and 23,732 families residing in the county.

The local authority has now also confirmed that it is aware of issues concerning the pool's seating area. It is understood that two lanes of the pool are not visible from the seats. The configuration and design of the pool is the responsibility of the council, rather than Hub North Scotland (Wick) Ltd, the organisation overseeing the construction of the campus. The pool is part of the campus which, once open, will offer community facilities as well as a new Wick High School and new buildings for the town's Pulteneytown and South primaries. Highland Council said: \\"We are aware of issues concerning seating and viewing of the new Wick High school swimming pool. This matter will be considered at the education, children and adults services committee on 25 August.\\" Following the announcement of delays in opening the campus, Highland Council's leader Margaret Davidson has asked the local authority's chief executive for an overview of the delivery of education capital projects.

Ms Davidson told BBC Radio Scotland that news of the pool viewing area was \\"disappointing\\", adding that she \\"believed there were other issues\\" to be addressed. She said it was important that people in Wick were informed of the problems and that the issues were resolved before the campus was opened to the public.

These parks span from the icy tundra of Alaska's Denali National Park to the coral reefs of Biscayne National Park in Florida. Every year, millions of tourists visit these parks to admire the unique biodiversity, astounding views, and partake in various outdoor activities like hiking, camping, and wildlife sighting. Despite being protected, these natural attractions are not immune to certain challenges, such as climate change, pollution, and invasive species that can significantly change ecosystems and threaten endemic species. Over the past years, reports have shown that average temperatures in many national parks are increasing at twice the rate of the national average. This rapid climate change has provoked the early blooming of plants, altering migratory patterns of birds and other species' breeding behaviors. The melting of glaciers in parks such as Glacier National Park and the threat to coral reefs due to ocean acidification is worrisome for the overall health of these ecosystems. Hypothesis: If the effects of climate change continue at present rates without any significant mitigation efforts, the U.S. national park system may face substantial ecological damage. The biodiversity in these parks could decline significantly, altering park ecosystems beyond recognizable states. This could result in a considerable decrease in tourism, affecting the economies of the local areas reliant on national park visitor spending. Furthermore, the cultural and historical importance of these parks could also be at risk, as natural landmarks may be permanently altered or lost, affecting the heritage and learning experiences these parks provide. Therefore, it's crucial for decision-makers to invest in strategies for reducing the parks' vulnerability to climate change, like restoring damaged ecosystems, introducing climate-smart management practices, and educating park goers about the importance of conservation. By doing so, the U.S. national park system, a treasured part of the national identity, may not only survive but thrive for generations to come."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is Mr. Bank's profession? is inside the article: In Edwardian London, 1910, Bert entertains a crowd as a one-man band when he senses a change in the wind.

It is also agreed that \\"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\\". But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". The well-known words of St. Augustine (d. 430) may be cited: \\"As regards the mother of God,\\" he says, \\"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).\\", answer the following question.

This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] In the beginning of this century there was scandal in the financial market regarding black market trading. A trader named Trader A was working for Bank A. He noticed country M has pegged its currency to a fixed price while country N did not do that. He opted to trade country M currency. Across the aisle his colleague trader B was working for bank B. He traded country N's currency. Would country M's currenccy be traded or not traded in the balck market? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, it is highly likely that country M's currency would be traded in the black market. This is because the fixed exchange rate set by the government of country M may not accurately reflect the true market value of the currency. As a result, people may use the black market to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies at a higher rate than the official rate. This creates a demand for the currency in the shadow economy and encourages black market trading."},{"instruction":"Eräs asia, jonka voimme tehdä sosiaalirahaston tuella, on kouluttaa henkilökuntaa ja kohentaa hoidon laatua, mutta päätös hoitolaitoksen ylläpitämisestä tai lakkauttamisesta kuuluu aina jäsenvaltion hallitukselle.

Options: a ) a ) 1000 , b ) b ) 1100 , c ) c ) 1200 , d ) d ) 1300 , e ) e ) 1400 A:","output":"a ) 1000 Explanation: Let the population 2 years ago be P. The population increased by 20% in the first year, so after the first year, the population would be P(1 + 0.20) = 1.20P. In the second year, it increased by 25%, so the population after the second year would be 1.20P(1 + 0.25) = 1.20P × 1.25 = 1.50P. According to the problem, after these two increases, the present population is 1500, so we have the equation: 1.50P = 1500 To find out the population 2 years ago (P), we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.50: P = 1500 ÷ 1.50 = 1000 So, the population of the town 2 years ago was 1000, which corresponds to option (a)."},{"instruction":"Possible answers: [i] yes.

Thank you all for agreeing to engage in a weekly online conversation about the fourth season of “Mad Men,” premiering tonight at 10 p.m. on AMC. I’ll try to post my reactions to each episode before going to bed on Sunday nights, and each of you will lob your thoughts over the virtual transom the following day or two. I hope readers will join in. My first question is what is it about “Mad Men” that has made it such a magnet? For me, the fascination is with the historical period in which it is set. The time from 1960 when the first season began and to 1968 was a period of extraordinary transition in gender, race, politics and social culture. “Mad Men” has thus far sought to capture both the literal reality and the “feel” of that time from the vantage point of a group — New York advertising executives — whose very job it was to understand what is happening in the culture. That they so often fail to appreciate what is happening all around them is very much a part of that reality. The mad men (and women) are both living in their culture and inventing it at the same time. As I noted last year in a reader comment to Slate’s excellent TV Club discussion of “Mad Men,” reinvention is the key to both Don’s personal and professional lives. What makes Don so successful as an ad man is his ability to reimagine and reinvent his clients’ products. Of course, he’s good at this because his entire life is itself a reinvention. He will do for your product what he has done for himself. Last season ended at Christmas 1963. The new season, we are told, picks up almost a year later: Thanksgiving 1964. Why that break in time? The skipped eleven months include the murders of civil rights workers Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner during Freedom Summer in Mississippi, the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Barry Goldwater’s triumph in the Republican presidential race over Nelson Rockefeller (for whom Betty Draper’s fiancé Henry Francis was a key staffer) and LBJ’s victory in the November election. It appears that executive producer Matthew Weiner wants his show to reflect history but not to be dominated by it, and thus avoided having those tumultuous events intrude directly on his narrative. I thought of you all for this online conversation because you are friends from whom I most want to hear reactions to the professional conflict and sexual politics at the heart of “Mad Men.” Toril Moi wasn’t in America at the time of “Mad Men,” right, Toril? You were getting your Ph.D. at Bergen in your native Norway. Toril is now a professor of literature and theater studies at Duke whose most recent book, “Henrik Ibsen and the Birth of Modernism” has won huge prizes. It’s actually your earlier work, “Sexual/Textual Politics: Feminist Literary Theory” that may be most relevant to “Mad Men.” I doubt Draper read Ibsen, although with Don you never really know for sure. David Paletz, like Toril, was born overseas and came to the U.S. from England in 1955. David is now a professor of political science at Duke and author of (among other fine books) “The Media in American Politics” and teaches courses with great titles like “Politics and Libido.” For many years David chaired the selection committee for the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival. David, before becoming a political scientist, you thought briefly about being a copywriter in New York. Does viewing “Mad Men” make you pine for the road not taken? Evangeline Morphos was very much in America during the “Mad Men” years. Evangeline, there is no one I associate more completely with New York City than you. Evangeline has been Chair of the undergraduate Drama Department at NYU and is now a professor at Columbia teaching television and the new media. Her eguider.com makes daily recommendations of the best online videos. For Sterling Cooper, black-and-white television was the “new medium.” I don’t know what Don and Roger would make of eguides. Finally, historian Alan Brinkley is recently liberated from administrative duties as the Provost at Columbia University. Alan, your fabulously reviewed new book on Henry Luce includes Luce’s final years in New York heading the Time-Life publishing empire. My god, I just realized that if early leaks are true, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce is actually moving into the Time-Life Building as the season opens. Will Donald Draper run into Henry Luce? If he does, will you include a description of this encounter in a second printing of “The Publisher: Henry Luce and His American Century”? I spent the summer of ’65 on Madison Avenue as a law clerk at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison. I went to Paul, Weiss because I was troubled by the fact that almost all of the major Wall Street firms still refused even to interview Jewish law students. As a poor white kid from North Carolina who had almost never been to a really fancy restaurant, I was astounded by the lavish lunchtime drinking in the world of Manhattan law and business. My new bride, Anne (Maxwell) Dellinger was a technical writer and editor at a life insurance company about two blocks from the Time-Life building. She was one of the few (if any) women at her office who were not secretaries or cleaners. We have marveled at how accurately Mad Men recreates that period’s changing world of women’s roles. The treatment of what it was like to be gay seems to be extremely sensitive, and the shadow of Antisemitism is also deftly handled. It is not yet clear whether the show will have the same sensitivity to issues of race. You can get up to speed for Season 4 by reading the Wikipedia entry on “Mad Men,” but the writing is sometimes a bit flat. One of the most hilarious scenes in the history of television, the John Deere tractor scene that splashed Guy MacKendrick’s bloody foot all over the Sterling Cooper office, is rendered thus by Wikipedia: “An unfortunate accident at work debilitated his replacement, thus allowing Lane Pryce to keep his current position.” I’m sure your comments on the show will have a bit more spark than that.

(CNN) -- For the second time in as many years -- after going 46 years with the same coach, Joe Paterno -- Penn State has named a new man to helm its storied football program. James Franklin, 41, was announced Saturday as the Nittany Lions' next football coach, replacing Bill O'Brien, who was hired in January 2012 and recently left to become head coach of the NFL's Houston Texans. \\"I'm excited to come home,\\" said Franklin, who had led Vanderbilt University's football team the last three years but originally hails from Langhorne, Pennsylvania. \\"I'm a Pennsylvania boy with a Penn State heart.\\"","output":"Franklin's appointment marks a significant milestone in Penn State's efforts to rebuild its football program after a turbulent time that saw the university grappling with the aftermath of a massive child abuse scandal that had tarnished the legacy of its once-iconic coach, Joe Paterno, and resulted in unprecedented sanctions imposed by the NCAA. In his three-year tenure at Vanderbilt, James Franklin proved himself an exceptional coach, transforming the university's football team from a perennial bottom dweller in the Southeastern Conference to a contender that achieved back-to-back nine-win seasons for the first time in its history. Equipped with a reputation for strong recruiting and player development, Franklin's coaching achievements at Vanderbilt garnered national attention and respect from peers in the football world, making him a natural choice for the Nittany Lions as they sought to restore stability and competitiveness to their football program. During his first press conference as Penn State's head coach, Franklin spoke passionately about his vision for the football program and his strong connection to the school and state. \\"This is my dream job,\\" he declared. \\"This is where I want to be.\\" Franklin went on to outline his plan to create a culture of hard work, discipline, and academic success, emphasizing the importance of developing well-rounded student-athletes who would succeed not only on the field but also in the classroom. Franklin faced a challenging environment in his initial years at Penn State, as the football program continued to navigate the aftermath of the scandal and resulting sanctions. Nonetheless, he demonstrated resilience and determination throughout his tenure, consistently putting together competitive teams and achieving notable successes, including a Big Ten Championship victory in 2016 and appearances in high-profile bowl games. As the sanctions gradually expired, Penn State was able to return to its full complement of scholarships and field a more robust roster. Under Franklin's leadership, the Nittany Lions quickly reemerged as a dominant force in college football, consistently ranking among the nation's top programs in terms of both on-field performance and recruiting prowess. James Franklin's tenure at Penn State continued to be marked by success and growth, as the Nittany Lions experienced a resurgence that resonated across the college football landscape. The program, once marred by scandal, proudly reclaimed its position among the elite, attracting top talent to its storied playing fields and confidently reestablishing its championship aspirations. As the years passed and Franklin's squads continued to thrive in the face of adversity, it became clear that Penn State had found the right man for the journey ahead – a Pennsylvania boy with a Penn State heart, fiercely committed to guiding the Nittany Lions through the challenges and triumphs that lay before them, and ushering in a new era of resilience and excellence."},{"instruction":"There have been nine Digimon movies released in Japan.

Your task is to summarize them. Input: Some of the bruises found on actress Natalie Wood's body may have occurred before she drowned in the waters off California more than 30 years ago, according to a newly released coroner's report on one of Hollywood's most mysterious deaths. Officials on Monday released an addendum to Wood's 1981 autopsy that cites unexplained bruises and scratches on Wood's face and arms as significant factors that led officials to change her death certificate last year from drowning to \\"drowning and other undetermined factors.\\" Officials were careful about their conclusions because they lacked several pieces of evidence. The renewed inquiry came after the boat's captain, Dennis Davern, told \\"48 Hours Mystery\\" and the \\"Today\\" show that he heard Wood and her actor-husband Robert Wagner arguing the night of her disappearance and believed Wagner was to blame for her death. Wood, 43, was on a yacht with Wagner, co-star Christopher Walken and the boat captain before somehow ending up in the water. Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said the newly released autopsy report does not change the status of the investigation, which remains open. Whitmore said Wagner is not considered a suspect in Wood's death. Conflicting versions of what happened on the yacht have contributed to the mystery of how the actress died. Wood, Wagner and Walken had all been drinking heavily before the actress disappeared. The original detective on the case, Wagner and Walken have all said they considered her death an accident. Bruises on Wood's arms, a scratch on her neck and superficial abrasions to her face may have occurred before Wood ended up in the waters off Catalina Island in November 1981, but coroner's officials wrote they could not definitely determine when the injuries occurred. \\"The location of the bruises, the multiplicity of the bruises, lack of head trauma, or facial bruising support bruising having occurred prior to entry in the water,\\" says the report, written by Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran. \\"Since there are unanswered questions and limited additional evidence available for evaluation, it is opined by this Medical Examiner that the manner of death should be left as undetermined.\\" Officials also considered that Wood wasn't wearing a life jacket and had no history of suicide attempts and didn't leave a note as reasons to amend the report and the death certificate. The newly released report also says there are conflicting statements about when the boat's occupants discovered Wood was missing. The report estimates her time of death was around midnight, and she was reported missing at 1:30 a.m. Wagner wrote in a 2008 memoir that he and Walken argued that night. He wrote that Walken went to bed and he stayed up for a while, but when he went to bed, he noticed that his wife and a dinghy attached to the yacht were missing. ||||| Actress Natalie Wood in 1963 / AP Photo (CBS/AP) LOS ANGELES - The Los Angeles Coroner's Office is expected to release a new report Monday in the drowning of actress Natalie Wood more than 30 years ago. 48 Hours Presents Vanity Fair: Hollywood Scandal Sources told CBS News the review of the 1981 coroner's report questions the findings that led investigators to conclude Wood's death was an accident. Sources say the new report concludes that the bruising on the actress' wrists, knees, and ankles could be more consistent with injuries from an assault than they were from struggling to climb back on a boat. Conflicting versions of what happened on the yacht shared by Wood, her actor-husband Robert Wagner and their friend, actor Christopher Walken, have contributed to the mystery of how the actress died on Thanksgiving weekend in 1981. Authorities have previously said Wagner is not a suspect in his wife's death.

Frida begins just before the traumatic accident Frida Kahlo suffered at the age of 18 when the wooden-bodied bus she was riding in collided with a streetcar. She is impaled by a metal pole and the injuries she sustained plague her for the rest of her life. To help her through convalescence, her father brings her a canvas upon which to start painting. Throughout the film, a scene starts as a painting, then slowly dissolves into a live action scene with actors. Frida also details the artist's dysfunctional relationship with the muralist Diego Rivera. When Rivera proposes to Kahlo, she tells him she expects from him loyalty if not fidelity. Diego's appraisal of her painting ability is one of the reasons that she continues to paint. Throughout the marriage, Rivera has affairs with a wide array of women, while the bisexual Kahlo takes on male and female lovers, including in one case having an affair with the same woman as Rivera. The two travel to New York City so that he may paint the mural Man at the Crossroads at the Rockefeller Center. While in the United States, Kahlo suffers a miscarriage, and her mother dies in Mexico. Rivera refuses to compromise his communist vision of the work to the needs of the patron, Nelson Rockefeller; as a result, the mural is destroyed. The pair return to Mexico, with Rivera the more reluctant of the two. Kahlo's sister Cristina moves in with the two at their San Ángel studio home to work as Rivera's assistant. Soon afterward, Kahlo discovers that Rivera is having an affair with her sister. She leaves him, and subsequently sinks into alcoholism. The couple reunite when he asks her to welcome and house Leon Trotsky, who has been granted political asylum in Mexico. She and Trotsky begin an affair, which forces the married Trotsky to leave the safety of his Coyoacán home.

If she got a 20% discount on the pencils and bought 100 cucumbers, calculate the total amount she spent to buy the items.. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"Step 1: Find the number of pencils Isabela bought. Since Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, and she bought 100 cucumbers, this means she bought 100 / 2 = 50 pencils. Step 2: Find the discount amount on the pencils. Before the discount, the cost of the pencils was 20 each. With a 20% discount, this means the discount amount is 20% x 20 = 0.20 x 20 = 4 per pencil. Step 3: Calculate the cost of the pencils after the discount. The price of the pencils after the discount is 20 original price - 4 discount = 16 per pencil. Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the pencils. With 50 pencils at 16 each, the total cost of the pencils is 50 x 16 = 800. Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the cucumbers. Since the cucumbers also cost 20 each and Isabela bought 100 cucumbers, the total cost of the cucumbers is 100 x 20 = 2000. Step 6: Calculate the total amount spent on both items. The total amount spent on both items is the cost of the pencils + the cost of the cucumbers. 800 for pencils + 2000 for cucumbers = 2800. So, Isabela spent a total of 2800 on the pencils and cucumbers."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

The Leningrad première of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 took place on 9 August 1942 during the Second World War, while the city of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) was under siege by Nazi German forces. Dmitri Shostakovich had intended the piece to be premièred by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, but because of the siege, that group was evacuated from the city, as was the composer himself. The world première of the symphony was held on 5 March in Kuybyshev with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra, supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians were suffering from starvation, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only once before the concert. Despite the poor condition of the performers, the concert was highly successful, prompting an hour-long ovation. The concert was supported by a Soviet military offensive, code-named Squall, intended to silence German forces during the performance. The symphony was broadcast to the German lines by loudspeaker as a form of psychological warfare. The Leningrad première was considered by music critics to be one of the most important artistic performances of the war because of its psychological and political effects.

Pollutants can disrupt the natural processes of sediment formation and deposition in several ways, such as altering water chemistry, affecting the organisms that contribute to sediment formation, and causing physical disturbances in the water bodies. Firstly, many pollutants can alter the water chemistry, making it difficult for microorganisms to thrive and contribute to sediment formation. For instance, excess nutrients from agricultural and urban runoff can lead to eutrophication, causing algal blooms and oxygen depletion. These conditions can harm the bottom-dwelling organisms responsible for breaking down organic material and producing sediment. Secondly, pollutants can directly impact the organisms that contribute to sediment formation and deposition. Heavy metals, pesticides, and other toxic chemicals can contaminate the water, leading to the death or reduced reproduction of organisms that play essential roles in sediment production. For example, filter-feeding bivalve mollusks and other invertebrates are known to process large volumes of water while feeding, removing particles from the water column and depositing them on the seafloor as fecal pellets or pseudofeces. If these organisms are affected by pollutants, less sediment may accumulate on the bottom. Lastly, physical disturbances caused by pollutants can lead to less sedimentation. For example, suspended solids and other pollutants can increase water turbidity, making it difficult for sediment particles to settle to the bottom. Pollutants can also cause erosion or resuspension of already deposited sediments, thus reducing the net sediment accumulation. In conclusion, the presence of more pollutants can negatively affect the sedimentation process in water bodies, leading to less sediment piling on top of dead organic material. This can, in turn, affect the subsequent formation of kerogen and the eventual production of petroleum or natural gas. Therefore, it is essential to manage and reduce pollutant inputs to aquatic systems to ensure the proper functioning of sedimentation processes and to maintain the long-term potential for hydrocarbon formation."},{"instruction":"Olympic related jobs in Utah started in 1996 with slight job opportunities of less than 100.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

He discovered that doubling the pressure of an enclosed sample of gas while keeping its temperature constant caused the volume of the gas to be reduced by half. Boyle’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. An inverse relationship is described in this way. As one variable increases in value, the other variable decreases. Aaron needs to clean his computer. He buys an air compressor so he can air clean all of the dust from his computer. The compressor forces high powered streams of air by compressing the air inside it then releasing it through a tube. Will decreasing pressure of a container of gas while the temperature remains constant increase or decrease its volume? The answer is:","output":"Decreasing the pressure of a container of gas while the temperature remains constant will increase its volume. This concept can be understood through Boyle's Law, which states that the volume of a given mass of gas is inversely proportional to the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. In simpler terms, this means that when the pressure decreases, the volume of the gas increases, provided that the temperature stays the same. This law holds true for real gases under most conditions they encounter. In Aaron's case, when he uses the air compressor to clean his computer, the compressor operates by taking in air and compressing it, thereby increasing the pressure inside the container. The compressed air is then released through the nozzle at a high velocity, which is effective in removing dust from the computer. However, if Aaron were to decrease the pressure inside the air compressor, while maintaining a constant temperature, the volume of air within the container would increase. The increase in volume occurs because the gas molecules have more space to move around when the pressure is decreased, leading to an expansion of the gas. Since the gas takes up more space within the container, the overall volume of the gas increases. This inverse relationship between pressure and volume, as demonstrated by Boyle's Law, is a fundamental concept in the field of chemistry and helps us understand the behavior of gases under changing conditions."},{"instruction":"Question: Whose preserved head can be seen in a large glass case at University College London?

She starts remembering her life.She has been through several positions of employment before and lost them due to her independent nature. She is given one last chance to be the hired companion for a irritable rich old woman, Mrs Hawkes (Margaret Withers). However, she recieves a letter offering her another position and she leaves Mrs Hawkes after having given her opinion of what she thinks of her.She is the new governess at the mansion of the Furys with a far superior salary. There, she comes to terms with her distant cousins. Her task is to teach and accompany young Lavinia (Suzanne Gibbs). However, the most complicated man within the household is Philip Thorn (Stewart Granger). He's an illegitimate child of the late father of the family, and he's suing the family so that he can inherit everything.There is a gypsy encampment near the village. Phillip enlists her aid in recovering some horses that were stolen by the gypsies and she is attacked by some of them. She and Phillip fight their way free and escape with the horses successfully. This angers the gypsies into seeking revenge. Blanche falls in love with Philip, however, she prefers to marry the wealthy son of the family, Simon (Walter Fitzgerald). Philip is told by his lawyer that they couldn't find any proof of his mother having married secretly in Italy. He is then driven by the heritage that he feels in his blood and the legend of the symbol of the family that guards it. When a beloved old horse is shot and killed because she can no longer profit the owners with foals it is the last straw. Philip murders the father and son in the disguise of the gypsies. This is easily believed as the gypsies had plenty of motive and had tried to take vengeance before by burning the family barn and been caught. Blanche knows that he did it because she saw him at the window that night and she aided in the murder by not warning her husband and his son or calling for help as she was told to... My question: Who is Thorn planning to blame the murder on? Answer:","output":"Thorn is planning to blame the murder of the father and son on the gypsies. Throughout the movie, the gypsies have been portrayed as antagonistic figures who have had conflicts with the Fury family and its members. They have stolen horses from the family and have even tried to take vengeance before by burning down the family barn. Philip Thorn decides to use the existing tension between the gypsies and the Fury family to his advantage. In order to murder the father and son without arousing suspicion on himself, he disguises himself as a gypsy while committing the crime. This strategy aligns with the gypsies' existing motive, making it easier to pin the blame on them for the murders. Furthermore, given that Blanche, who is aware of Philip's actions, does not warn her husband and his son nor does she call for help, she indirectly aids in the murders. As a result, Thorn successfully manages to execute his plan and attempts to direct the blame towards the gypsies for the murder of the father and son."},{"instruction":"Process: - An owl leaves his nest - The owl flys out into the night - The owl looks down at the ground - The owls keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark - The owls sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey - The owl swoops down - The owl catches a mouse in his talons.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the process. If \\"The owl is more hungry\\" happens, it will significantly influence the behavior and actions of the owl throughout the entire process. Direct effect: As the owl is more hungry, it will look at the ground more carefully in search of food. Hunger increases the owl's motivation to search for and catch prey. This heightened motivation will directly lead to the owl spending more time and energy scanning the ground, attempting to locate potential prey it can target. Indirect effect: Hunger not only influences the owl's attentiveness in looking at the ground, but also impacts its other behaviors in the process. For example, the owl might fly out into the night with more urgency, prompted by the increased hunger. This may result in the owl covering a larger area in its search for food, increasing the likelihood of finding potential prey. Moreover, a hungrier owl might exhibit greater persistence in its hunting efforts. The owl may attempt to catch multiple prey items in a single night to satiate its increased hunger, rather than being content with catching just one mouse. It may also be less selective in its choice of prey, expanding its target options to include potential prey that may be more challenging to catch or might not be its preferred food choice under normal circumstances. The owl's keen eyesight and sensitive hearing, which are vital in its search for prey, may also be indirectly affected by the increased hunger. A hungrier owl might place even greater focus on utilizing its sensory abilities to their fullest extent in order to maximize its chances of capturing enough prey to fulfill its hunger needs. Overall, the perturbation of the owl being more hungry has both direct and indirect effects on the process. Hunger directly impacts the owl's attentiveness in looking at the ground, increasing the likelihood of locating and capturing prey. Hunger also indirectly affects various aspects of the owl's behavior, including its urgency in setting out to hunt, the area it covers, persistence and determination in capturing prey, and the heightened focus on utilizing its senses to their utmost capacity."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Galvarino Apablaza is the leader of the Marxist group FPMR - Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front.

Therefore, based on the given text, the correct answer is (B). no. This conclusion is based on the textual analysis and the information provided, as it does not mention any aliases or nicknames for Galvarino Apablaza."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Here's a question: When you first wake up and head to work what do you have to do? Here are possible answers to this question: - get going - concentrate - drink coffee - get dressed - have job I believe the correct choice is \\"get going\\", here's why: A:","output":"When you first wake, you have to get going, which is the correct choice among the given options. However, I would like to provide a detailed and comprehensive explanation to justify this choice and put it in context with the other options provided. 1. Get going: \\"Get going\\" is an umbrella term that encompasses all the necessary actions one must take to begin their day and head to work. This includes waking up, freshening up, dressing, eating breakfast, preparing for the workday, and ultimately making your way to work. Inherent within the phrase \\"get going\\" is the idea of being proactive and initiating the day's tasks. 2. Concentrate: Concentration is indeed a critical aspect of waking up and starting your day. Mental focus on your goals and responsibilities is crucial to accomplishing tasks effectively. However, concentrate comes into play after the initial steps of \\"get going\\" have been accomplished – after waking up, freshening up, and organizing thoughts for the day. 3. Drink coffee: Drinking coffee, for many, is an integral part of the workday routine. Caffeine in coffee helps stimulate the central nervous system, elevates mood, and enhances alertness. Drinking coffee certainly plays a part in the overall process to \\"get going,\\" but it is just one part of the broader sequence to start the day and reach the workplace. 4. Get dressed: Getting dressed is undoubtedly an essential step in the process of starting the day and heading to work as it prepares you physically and mentally for the workday ahead. Dressing in appropriate attire for your job establishes a sense of professionalism and focus, putting you in the right mindset for the tasks that will follow. However, getting dressed is only one action among several that need to be completed to \\"get going\\". 5. Have a job: Having a job is the implied foundation of this question. If you are heading to work, you already possess a job. A job provides you with the responsibilities and motivators that contribute to the reason why you must \\"get going\\" in the first place. With a job in place, the impetus for adhering to a morning routine is established. In conclusion, \\"get going\\" is the most accurate option from the choices given as it accurately encapsulates the entire process of starting one's day and preparing for work. While concentrate, drink coffee, get dressed, and have a job are all integral components, they each represent one part of an overarching process, while \\"get going\\" signifies the collective effort to start the day and make your way to work efficiently."},{"instruction":"How to determine the sex of a cat<br>Approach the cat or kitten with care.

Do the particles have more kinetic energy in the ice cream or in the soup? Noah is currently making dinner in his kitchen. He has been boiling some soup on the stove for a while, so the temperature of the soup is currently high. Noah's brother, Justin, is sitting on the couch in the living room. Justin is eating ice cream, which has a low temperature. Hint: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Answer:","output":"The particles have more kinetic energy in the soup than in the ice cream. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that Noah has been boiling soup, so the soup has a high temperature. On the other hand, Justin is consuming ice cream, which has a low temperature. According to the principles of physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When the particles move more quickly, they possess more kinetic energy, and the temperature is higher. This causes the matter to feel warmer. Conversely, when the particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, resulting in a lower temperature. As a result, the matter feels cooler. Since the soup has a high temperature, this implies that the particles in the soup are moving rapidly and possess more kinetic energy. In contrast, the ice cream has a low temperature, meaning that the particles in the ice cream are moving slower and have less kinetic energy. Therefore, the particles have more kinetic energy in the soup than in the ice cream."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Italy, capital, Rome; Italy, leader, Matteo Renzi; Amatriciana sauce, country, Italy; Italy, leader, Laura Boldrini","output":"In Italy, Rome serves as the capital, Matteo Renzi and Laura Boldrini hold leadership positions, and Amatriciana sauce originates from this renowned country."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Paragraph: Two earth-like planets orbited the same star. The inhabitants of Earth I released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Earth II ,however, was much more conscious about the environment and protected it from anthropogenic changes. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which planet caused more climate change? Answer:","output":"Based on the given paragraph, Earth I caused more climate change as its inhabitants released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In contrast, Earth II was more environmentally conscious and protected its environment from anthropogenic changes.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've mentioned, \\"The home isn't insulated well,\\" can have an indirect effect on the amount of fuel/air mixture injected into the burner. While the insulation quality of the home doesn't directly alter the rate at which fuel/air mixture is injected, it can influence the overall heating system's performance and efficiency. In a home with poor insulation, heat is lost more quickly to the outside environment, causing the inside temperature to drop faster. As a result, the thermostat will sense that room temperature falls below the thermostat setting more frequently. This will lead to the heating system being engaged more often to compensate for the heat loss. When the heating system is activated, the oil burner burns more fuel/air mixture to produce heat. Thus, in a poorly insulated home, the heating system may operate more frequently and for more extended periods. Therefore, indirectly, poor insulation can lead to an increase in the amount of fuel/air mixture injected into the burner over time to maintain the desired temperature in the home. In summary, while the perturbation of poor insulation does not directly affect the rate at which fuel/air mixture is injected, it can increase the frequency and duration of heating system operation, leading to more fuel/air mixture being used for heating the home."},{"instruction":"Process: - Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots and passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Chlorophyll absorbs the sun&#x27;s energy - It is this energy that is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen is released from the leaves into the atmosphere - Hydrogen and carbon dioxide are used to form glucose or food for plants. suppose enough carbon dioxide reaches the leaves happens, how will it affect less carbon dioxide is availabe to form glucose. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"If enough carbon dioxide reaches the leaves but there is less carbon dioxide available to form glucose, it implies that there could be a limiting factor other than carbon dioxide availability that affects the rate of photosynthesis and glucose production. The limiting factor could either be the availability of light energy, water supply, or reaction conditions (e.g., temperature or pH). In this scenario, the supposed perturbation would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. The limitation in this case is not directly impacting any step in the photosynthesis process, as the carbon dioxide is already present within the leaf stomata. However, since the formation of glucose requires hydrogen obtained from water molecules (as well as carbon dioxide), any limitation that reduces the rate of water molecule splitting or affects the overall process would indirectly impact the glucose production. For example, if there is not enough water available, this will limit the production of hydrogen required for glucose synthesis. Alternatively, if the amount of light energy is limited (e.g., during cloudy days or in shaded areas), the efficiency of photosynthesis is reduced, resulting in less glucose production. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation in this case would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. This means that the limitation is not directly targeting a specific step within the photosynthesis process itself, but it is affecting the rate or efficiency of the process by influencing factors such as water availability, light energy, or other reaction conditions. These factors indirectly impact the glucose formation, ultimately leading to reduced synthesis of this essential plant energy source."},{"instruction":"Though Cairo has many modern and nondescript suburbs, the oldest districts of Al-Qahira are well-preserved and exhibit some of the finest period architecture in the Islamic world.

This Cotto place is located near a river, which is a flowing body of water. It's a pretty view where you can see the water moving and maybe even some ducks swimming by. And you know what's really cool? There's another fun place called The Portland Arms just nearby, so after enjoying a nice meal at Cotto, people can go there and have a great time too!"},{"instruction":"What style did the man who recorded \\"Haunted House\\" use during his first releases in 1990? Answer the above question based on the context below: Many independent Chicago-based record labels were also getting their artists on the dance charts. Detroit DJ Terrence Parker uses his advanced turntablism skills and his focus on precision to blend hip hop music DJing styles, such as rhythmic scratching, in his house mixes. Fellow Detroit spinner DJ Minx is a notable woman house DJ. Her records on her Women on Wax label blend Parker-influenced turntablism precision with a funky style. In the UK, any house song released by a Chicago-based label was routinely considered a \\"must-play\\" at UK house music clubs. Paradise Garage in New York City was still a top club in the house era, just as it had been during the disco age. The emergence of Todd Terry, a pioneer of the genre, demonstrated the continuum from the underground disco approach which moved to a new house sound. Terry's cover of Class Action's \\"Weekend\\" (mixed by Larry Levan) shows how Terry drew on newer hip-hop influences, such as the quicker sampling and the more rugged basslines. In the late 1980s, Nu Groove Records launched and nurtured the careers of Rheji Burrell and Rhano Burrell, collectively known as Burrell (after a brief stay on Virgin America via Timmy Regisford and Frank Mendez). Nu Groove also had a stable of other NYC underground scene DJs. The Burrell's created the \\"New York Underground\\" sound of house, and they did 30+ releases on this label featuring this sound. In the 2010s, Nu Groove Record releases like the Burrells' enjoy a cult status among \\"crate diggers\\" and DJs. Mint-condition vinyl records by the Burrells from the 1980s can fetch high prices. By the late 1980s, house DJing and production had moved to the US's west coast, particularly to San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Fresno, San Diego and Seattle. Los Angeles saw am explosion of underground raves, where DJs mixed dance tracks. L.A. DJs Marques Wyatt and Billy Long spun at Jewel's Catch One.

Reasoning: The human body requires essential nutrients, energy, and hydration to survive and function properly. These needs are met by consuming food and water. A well-balanced diet provides essential macronutrients (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), which all have specific roles in the body's growth, maintenance, and repair. Water is essential for life not only because it constitutes about 60% of the human body, but also because it is involved in several vital processes such as digestion, circulation, temperature regulation, waste elimination, and maintaining cellular functions. Without food, the body will eventually utilize stored energy reserves, such as fat and muscle tissues, but eventually, this would lead to severe malnutrition and health problems. Without water, dehydration will set in relatively quickly (a matter of days), which can be life-threatening if not addressed. Thus, the answer to the question \\"Is it possible for a human to survive solely on air, without consuming any food or water?\\" is no, as the human body needs essential nutrition and hydration to function properly and maintain overall health."},{"instruction":"Carmen Lebbos (Arabic: كارمن لبّس‎ ‎ ; born 1963) is a Lebanese actress who has been working in film, television and the theater since 1981.

As organisms change over time, they look different. Older fossils will look different than younger fossils. Some organisms only survived for a short time before going extinct. Knowing what organisms looked like at certain times also helps date rock layers. Some fossils are better than others for this use. The fossils that are very distinct at certain times of Earths history are called index fossils. Index fossils are commonly used to match rock layers. You can see how this works in Figure 2.30. If two rock layers have the same index fossils, then they're probably about the same age.

In an age when a few clicks on a cellphone can solve myriad problems, it seems fair to ask why people are still descending from the roofs of skyscrapers to rub soapy water on glass and wipe it off with a squeegee. Can’t robots take on this simple, repetitive task and relieve humans of the risk of injury, or death, from a plunge to the sidewalk? The simple answer, several experts said, is that washing windows is something that machines still cannot do as well as people can. The more complicated answer is that high-rise buildings are more complicated than they used to be. “Building are starting to look like huge sculptures in the sky,” said Craig S. Caulkins, who consults with building owners on how to maintain their exteriors. “A robot can’t maneuver to get around those curves to get into the facets of the building,” he said Brent Weingard, of Expert Window Cleaners, has battled dirt and grime high above New York City for over 35 years. Mr. Caulkins, the president of C. S. Caulkins Co. in Irvine, Calif., said “the robots have problems.” Most notably, he said, robotic cleaning systems tend to leave dirt in the corners of the glass walls that are designed to provide panoramic views from high floors. “If you are a fastidious owner wanting clean, clean windows so you can take advantage of that very expensive view that you bought, the last thing you want to see is that gray area around the rim of the window,” Mr. Caulkins said. Indeed, prime examples of that particular shortcoming are the towers of the original World Trade Center; the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey equipped those buildings with a mechanical apparatus for cleaning their windows, but it worked so poorly that human window washers had to follow behind to catch the spots the machine missed, said Steven Plate, director of the World Trade Center construction department at the Port Authority. “It was never effective,” Mr. Plate said in an interview on Thursday. “It basically didn’t clean the building.” One of the men who kept the glass of the twin towers clean was Roko Camaj, whose hazardous duty was the subject of a children’s book “Window Washer: At Work Above the Clouds.” The book, published in 1995, quoted Mr. Camaj saying that “Ten years from now, all window washing will probably be done by a machine.” On that point, Mr. Camaj, who was killed when the towers were destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001, was not a prophet. Mr. Caulkins said “there may be several dozen” skyscrapers in the entire country that employ robots to clean their windows. Another reason for the sparse use of robots is that buildings require a lot more maintenance than just window cleaning, Mr. Caulkins said. Equipment is needed to lower people to repair facades and broken windows, like the one that rescue workers had to cut through to rescue the window washers on Wednesday, he said. “At some point you need workers up on the side of that building,” Mr. Caulkins said. If a building requires a mechanism on the roof to lower a platform for that sort of work, the owner is unlikely to invest in a second, mechanized system for cleaning the glass, he said. In all, there are about 700 scaffolds for window washing on buildings in New York City, said Gerard McEneaney, a field representative for about 500 washers who are members of S.E.I.U. Local 32BJ, a union representing building service employees. Mr. McEneaney said he understood why the owners of 1 World Trade Center would employ humans to clean the tapered glass facade. “They want that building sparkling, sparkling clean,” he said. His members are willing to do the work because it pays well: as much 26.89 an hour plus benefits. Many of the window cleaners are immigrants from South America. “They’re fearless guys, fearless workers,” Mr. McEneaney said. Having spent nine years on scaffolds in New York City, he said he knew firsthand how scary an ordeal like the one on Wednesday could be. The first time he descended on a scaffold at 1 Penn Plaza, he said, his end of the platform did not stop when it should have, tilting the scaffold. His partner reacted quickly and lowered his end of the platform to keep it level and avert the need for a rescue, he said. “In a job where you know your life hangs in the balance, you just kind of accept it and rely on your partner and pray that your training has prepared you.” A version of this article appears in print on November 14, 2014, on page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: Window Washing Skills Beyond a Robot’s Reach.

Additionally, buildings require maintenance beyond just window cleaning, and it is often more cost-effective for building owners to use human labor for these tasks."},{"instruction":"I've seen the Gator Bait films, and this is almost exactly the same thing as those. A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them. The thing that sets this movie apart from those ones (although not very far) is that the sexual content is not glorified. There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film, but not for a second is it ever sexy. Some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive, but that's only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience's need to see this woman seek revenge. This is a weak film, it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers. I Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral, but I was glad to see that, since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead, it was not meant to pass off as a T&A film. B-movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality, and while I Spit On You Grave is unmistakably a B-movie and contains more than its share of nudity, the nudity does not drive the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists. These men are evolutionary drop-outs just like they were in the Gator Bait films, and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless B-movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind, but instead it simply satisfies the audience's desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve. The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks. Oddly, the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity (although not by much), but it is by far the most painful to watch. We are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible (it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller, staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord), but again, this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with. (spoilers) You know that this is all the movie means to do, since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed. The woman does not live happily ever after, she doesn't write her book, she doesn't leave and never return to that nightmare place, she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks. But hey, what more did you expect? Oh, and did you read the tagline? If you decide to waste your time watching this, try and find any man getting broken or burned. I was really looking forward to those Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review thought negatively of the movie. The reviewer points out the film's weak plot, which solely relies on the audience's desire to see the woman exact revenge on her attackers. Additionally, the reviewer expresses disappointment in some of the unrealistic and elaborate death scenes. The presence of nudity in the film is not glorified or driving the plot, which is seen as somewhat redeeming, but overall, the movie is described as a \\"meaningless B-movie\\" that lacks any substantial message."},{"instruction":"What key details about pavlo savelenko can be extracted from the following bio?

She was the earliest recycle queen before people had a name for it. My father was no different. He preferred getting old shoes fixed to -buying new ones. Their marriage was good and their dreams were focused .Their best friends lived just a wave away. Though my parents have passed away, I can see them now - Dad in trousers, a T-shirt and a hat and Mom in a house dress, lawnmower in one hand and dishtowel in the other. It was the time to fix things -a curtain rod ,the kitchen radio, the screen door, the oven door, and so on. They fixed all things we had. It was a way of life, and sometimes it made me crazy. All that re-fixing and renewing made me want to scream.1 wanted just once to be wasteful. Waste meant being rich. Throwing things away meant you knew there'd always be more. I often thought like that. But then my mother died, and on that clear summer night, in the warmth of the hospital room, I learned that sometimes there isn't any more. Sometimes, what we care about most gets all used up and goes away and it will never return.

David has just returned from Switzerland, where he was finishing writing his latest novel, and their task gives them a private opportunity to discuss Karin's status, whose schizophrenia has been diagnosed as most likely incurable.On the way to the farm, Minus expresses his hope that their father will be successful with his latest novel's publication. On the way back, Minus confides in his sister his sexual apprehensions, which eventually degenerates into his admonishment of Karin for the (maybe) too intimate attention she keeps showing toward him. But most importantly, he confesses how much he wishes he could communicate with his father.The quartet is reunited for the evening dinner around a table in front of their cottage. Again, a festive atmosphere prevails, but soon turns sour. David confesses that while he was anxious to return to his family after his long absence, that he is about to leave again, in spite of his earlier promise to his children not to travel so often. Somewhat guiltily, and seeking forgiveness, David distributes some presents, all of them turning out to be unsuitable.

The farm scene then colors itself, and the camera zooms in just as the plot follows: A realistic-looking horse is seen, whinnying (courtesy of Mel Blanc), and a comic triple plays out: The narrator asks the horse to do a trot; the horse obliges. The narrator asks for a gallop; the horse again obliges. The narrator then asks the horse to do a \\"canter\\". The horse turns from realistic to a cartoon horse, with the bugged eyes of, and singing \\"I'm Happy About the Whole Thing\\" (by Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer) in the style of, the vaudeville star Eddie Cantor, vocally impersonated by Kent Rogers. The narrator admonishes the horse, which grins sheepishly. The family dog is seen lazing on the porch, springing to alertness when the newspaper arrives. The dog makes a mad dash to the end of the driveway, gets the paper, comes back to the porch, and immediately starts to read the paper himself, starting with the Sunday comics. He turns to the audience, and says, \\"I can hardly wait to see what happened to Dick Tracy!\\" (This gag would be used by Clampett again in The Great Piggy Bank Robbery.) A hen leaves her eggs unguarded, and a mean-looking weasel stealthily creeps into the henhouse while the narrator frets. Just as he is about to grab the eggs, they all hatch at once, and the chicks shout \\"BOO!\\" in unison. The frightened weasel evokes a Joe Penner catch-phrase, \\"Don't ever DOOO that!\\" and gasps as his heart pounds.

Both these developments have reminded NATO that its core business -- the defense of its member states -- needs to be returned to the center of the alliance's agenda. Russia's annexation of Crimea and continued push into the south-east of Ukraine -- a NATO partner country -- has inevitably provoked fear amongst Ukraine's neighbors, all of whom have relatively fresh memories of Russian domination.

This modest amount pales in comparison to the resources being poured into the conflict by Russia, leaving Ukraine feeling vulnerable and uncertain about its future. In response to these developments, NATO has decided to step up its presence in Eastern Europe to reassure its members and demonstrate its commitment to collective defense. This will involve the establishment of rapid response units, increased military exercises, and a larger presence of both military personnel and equipment in the region. While these measures may not directly address the immediate needs of Ukraine, they send a clear message to Russia that NATO is serious about protecting its member states and will not tolerate further aggression. Moreover, the alliance is working on strengthening its ties with non-member countries in the region, such as Sweden and Finland, to create a stronger security network and deter any potential aggression. This regional cooperation will be essential in maintaining stability and preventing the conflict from spreading further. In addition to focusing on the defense of its members, NATO must also address the growing threat posed by ISIS, which has emerged as a significant challenge to the international community. The summit, therefore, also devoted time to discussing a coordinated approach to tackle the terrorist organization, including the expansion of airstrikes, support for local forces fighting ISIS, and the sharing of intelligence necessary to disrupt and degrade the group's operations. In summary, while the original goal of the NATO summit in Wales was to prepare for the post-Afghanistan era, the rapidly changing global security landscape has forced the alliance to refocus its agenda on addressing current challenges. This includes reinforcing its commitment to the defense of its member states in the face of Russian aggression and working collaboratively to combat the rise of ISIS.

This hidden gem, nestled amidst the bustling city, is a haven of serenity and lush greenery that truly lives up to its name. Upon arriving, I was warmly greeted by the friendly and knowledgeable staff who took the time to offer a brief overview of the garden's history and the attractions I could explore. Their welcoming demeanor set the tone for the rest of my visit, as I embarked on a journey of natural beauty and relaxation. The sprawling grounds of Tranquil Gardens boast an impressive variety of meticulously maintained flora and fauna - a testament to the hard work and dedication of the expert gardeners.

Ambling along the well-marked paths, I discovered various themed gardens that showcased diverse horticultural collections, from the serene Japanese garden to the charming butterfly garden teeming with fluttering friends. Within the gardens, several quiet nooks provide the ideal setting for introspection and meditation, as the harmonious songs of birds in the trees offer an enchanting soundtrack. The calming sound of water features dotted throughout the gardens, including fountains and a tranquil koi pond, further enhanced the overall sense of tranquility. To say that I was captivated by the undisturbed peacefulness of Tranquil Gardens would be a gross understatement. It is unusual to find such a sanctuary amidst the noise and chaos of the world outside, and I appreciated every moment spent there, walking through the living art exhibit that nature had so effortlessly created. In addition to the lush surroundings, the gardens also house a quaint cafe, where I had the opportunity to savor delicious, locally sourced refreshments. I particularly enjoyed the fresh herbal tea, made from ingredients picked right there in the garden, and a scrumptious slice of homemade cake. As I lingered at the cafe, I noticed the space also doubled as a quaint gift shop filled with charming keepsakes, like artisanal candles, handmade jewelry, and garden-inspired art pieces. I couldn't resist taking home a small memento to remind me of my delightful day. In conclusion, my positive experience at Tranquil Gardens truly cannot be overstated.

Born in Indiana to an impoverished family, Shoup joined the military for financial reasons. Rising through the ranks in the interwar era, he was twice deployed to China during the Chinese Civil War. He served in Iceland at the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, and as a staff officer during the Pacific War. In mid-1943, Shoup was transferred to the staff of Major General Julian C. Smith, commander of the 2nd Marine Division, and tasked to help plan the invasion of Betio on Tarawa Atoll. Shoup's aggressive leadership style would complement the offensive strategy his superiors were seeking in taking the atoll. He was tasked with drawing up initial plans, designating the landing beaches on Betio for the 2nd Marines, and overseeing some rehearsals at Efate. However, after Colonel William W. Marshall, commander of the 2nd Marines, suffered a nervous breakdown before invasion, Smith promoted Shoup to Colonel and gave him command of the regiment, in spite of Shoup's lack of combat experience. The invasion commenced on 20 November 1943, with Shoup disembarking from Maryland, the flagship for the invasion. His force met heavy resistance on the beaches. His LVT was destroyed by shore fire, and he had to proceed without transportation. As he was wading ashore at around 11:00, he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and received a grazing wound from a bullet in the neck. In spite of these wounds, he rallied the Marines and led them ashore. He was able to coordinate the troops on the beaches and organize them as they began to push inland against an anticipated Japanese counterattack. He continuously organized aggressive attacks on the defenders, and was noted for his bravery and vigour during the conflict. On the second day of the attack, he organized an advance inland, despite heavy casualties among the American troops. By the afternoon, they were winning the battle, and reinforcements began to arrive in force. That night, Shoup was relieved by Colonel Merritt A. Edson, the division's Chief of Staff, who commanded the 2nd Marines for the remainder of the campaign. Six years later, Shoup made a cameo appearance in the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\" reprising his actions that first night on Tarawa, although he had originally been brought onto the movie as a technical advisor. For his leadership during the assault and the push inland Shoup was awarded the Medal of Honor and the British Distinguished Service Order. For his role in planning the invasion he was awarded the Legion of Merit with \\"V\\" device. He also was awarded the Purple Heart for the combat wounds he suffered during the course of the campaign. Ten years after the assault, Shoup remarked of the operation, \\"there was never a doubt in the minds of those ashore what the final outcome of the battle for Tarawa would be. There was for some seventy-six hours, however, considerable haggling with the enemy over the exact price we would have to pay.\\" In 1968, he returned to Tarawa to dedicate a memorial to the battle and to the American and Japanese troops who had died there. What is Tarawa?","output":"Tarawa is an atoll in the central Pacific Ocean, part of the Gilbert Islands. In the quote from the article, \\"Shoup's aggressive leadership style would complement the offensive strategy his superiors were seeking in taking the atoll.\\" This suggests that Tarawa was a strategic location and the site of a significant battle during World War II, which involved General David Monroe Shoup leading an invasion."},{"instruction":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .","output":"Step 1: Identify sentiment words and phrases First, we need to identify the sentiment words and phrases in the sentence.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

Also in India, you might see a man shaking his head at another to show that he doesn't agree. But in many parts of India a shake of the head means agreement. Nodding your head when you are given a drink in Bulgaria will most probably leave you thirsty . In that country, you shake your head to mean 'yes'-- a nod means 'no' . At a meal in countries on the Arabic Peninsula, you will find that your glass is repeated refilled as soon as you drink up . If you think that you have had enough , you should take the cup or glasses in your hand and give it a little shake from side to side or place your hand over the top.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What position does Lil' Magi hold in the gang? Movie plot title: Sin Nombre Movie plot: Willy, nicknamed El Casper, is a member of the Mara Salvatrucha gang and lives in Tapachula, a Mexican town near the border with Guatemala. He introduces a young boy into his gang, and the boy is given the nickname Smiley after a violent initiation. Casper later helps Smiley to complete this initiation by helping him execute a rival gang-member. Casper is romantically involved with a girl, Martha Marlen. Fearing for the girl's safety, he keeps the relationship a secret from his gang, but his double life causes his gang to doubt his loyalty. When Martha follows Casper to a gathering of his gang, the gang leader, Lil Mago, escorts her out, despite Casper's misgivings. Mago attempts to rape Martha and accidentally kills her. Later, he blithely tells Casper that he will find another. Shortly afterward, Mago brings Casper and Smiley to La Bombilla, a location along the train tracks where potential illegal immigrants stow away on passing trains on their way to the United States. Among the immigrants is a Honduran family introduced earlier consisting of the teenage girl Sayra, her father, and her uncle, who are on their way to relatives in New Jersey. Lil Mago, Casper, and Smiley rob the passengers for any money they have until Lil Mago spots Sayra and attempts to rape her. Casper intervenes, killing Mago and then sending Smiley off. Smiley goes back to the gang and reports about Mago's death. The new gang leader, El Sol, accuses Smiley of collusion, to which Smiley timidly protests and begs to be sent to kill Casper to prove his loyalty. El Sol agrees and Smiley travels north to track down Casper. On the train, the still shocked Casper is avoided by other passengers. When some try to throw him off the train, Sayra warns Casper and keeps on approaching him, despite her father's warnings. Casper's knowledge from previously smuggling gang members and avoiding the police proves useful, as he eludes his pursuers. He is finally accepted by Sayra's family but decides to leave the train while the others are sleeping....

The presence of coal on a conveyor belt can indirectly impact the quality of the air in the surrounding environment which can variably affect the amount of oxygen available for the lungs to take in. While the coal scenario is not directly involved in the process of oxygen intake and carbon dioxide exchange, it can have an indirect effect on the efficiency of the process due to potentially lower oxygen levels or air pollution."},{"instruction":"While your skin is likely itchy, scratching only further irritates it, and can increase the duration of the reaction and even cause it to spread further. Do not itch or touch the affected area. Note that if scratching is particularly tempting, try wearing gloves or mittens while at home. If this is uncomfortable for you, clipping your nails can also help. Anything to delay the instant gratification of scratching deters you from indulging in the behavior. Tight clothes can rub against a skin rash, further irritating the area. Wear loose-fitting clothing or, if possible, clothing that does not cover the affected area at all, such as shorts or t-shirts. Moisture and heat of any kind can sometimes irritate a skin rash, so make sure the clothing is lightweight and made from a material that dries quickly, such as cotton. If your symptoms are severe; a damp dressing may help. Find a soft cotton garment like a long-sleeve t-shirt or long underwear, soak it in cool water, wring it out, and then put it on. Wear a loose-fitting garment over the dressing. During the duration of the rash, activities that lead to unnecessary skin contact and sweating should be avoided. Most contact sports - like football, rugby, and hockey - should be avoided altogether as it's hard to avoid touching and further irritating the skin. Exercises like aerobics, running, and weightlifting can be fine. However, sweating can be harmful to a skin rash so if you choose to participate find fast-drying workout clothing that does not have too much contact with the affected area. Summary:","output":"1. Avoid scratching or touching the affected area to prevent further irritation and spreading. 2. Wear gloves, mittens, or clip your nails to deter scratching. 3. Wear loose-fitting and lightweight clothing made from materials like cotton to minimize irritation. 4. Consider using a damp dressing if symptoms are severe. 5. Avoid activities with skin contact and excessive sweating, like contact sports. 6. Choose appropriate exercise like aerobics, running, or weightlifting, but select fast-drying clothes and minimal contact with the affected area."},{"instruction":"How to use adjustable objective rifle scopes<br>Be sure that your scope is mounted properly.

Which language is this?","output":"The language of your question, \\"A paní je pojištěná?\\" is Czech. It is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic, where it is the official language. The Czech language belongs to the Indo-European family of languages, specifically the West Slavic subgroup, which also includes Slovak and Polish. The literal translation of your question in English is, \\"And is the lady insured?\\". In this sentence, \\"A\\" is a conjunction used similarly to \\"and\\" or \\"so\\" in English. \\"Paní\\" translates to \\"lady\\" or \\"Mrs.\\", is a polite form to refer to an adult woman. \\"Je\\" is the present tense of the verb \\"to be\\", and \\"pojištěná\\" is derived from the word \\"pojištění\\", which means insurance. The suffix \\"-ená\\" implies the female gender and passive voice. So, the sentence is asking about the insurance status of a woman. Czech is a highly inflected language, meaning that the endings of words change to indicate grammatical case, tense, and gender. It is also characteristic for Czech to have a flexible word order, which allows emphasis on different parts of the sentence. Although \\"A paní je pojištěná?\\" is a common way of asking this question, it could also be \\"Je paní pojištěná?\\" without altering the meaning. Czech uses the Latin alphabet, supplemented by several specific diacritical marks which are used to differentiate identical sounds. It should be noted that Czech is known to be a challenging language for English speakers to learn due to its complex grammar structure and use of diacritics. However, like all language learning, with practice, dedication, and immersion, it can be mastered over time."},{"instruction":"Question: - Plates on the Earth&#x27;s crust move slowly past each other - As the plates move, they exert a great force - When the force is large enough, the crust breaks - The stress is released as energy - The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves What might be the last step of the process?
