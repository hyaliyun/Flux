Answer:","output":"Hermann Oppenheim (1 January 1858 – 5 May 1919) was a prominent German neurologist. He studied medicine at the Universities of Berlin, Göttingen, and Bonn and began his career at the Charité-Hospital in Berlin as an assistant to Karl Westphal (1833-1890). In 1891, Oppenheim opened a successful private hospital in Berlin. Oppenheim authored a seminal textbook on nervous diseases in 1894, titled \\"Lehrbuch der Nervenkrankheiten für Ärzte und Studierende,\\" which became a standard in the field of neurology. The book was published in multiple editions and languages and is considered one of the best neurology textbooks ever written. He contributed significantly to the understanding of various neurological disorders such as tabes dorsalis, alcoholism, anterior poliomyelitis, syphilis, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic neurosis. In the field of physiology, Oppenheim published articles on urea metabolism in collaboration with Nathan Zuntz (1847-1920). His 1889 treatise on traumatic neuroses was met with criticism from renowned physicians Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) and Max Nonne (1861-1959), as he asserted that psychological trauma caused organic changes leading to psychic neuroses. Oppenheim's expertise in brain diseases contributed to the first successful removal of a brain tumor, an operation performed by a physician named R. Köhler. Along with surgeon Fedor Krause (1857-1937), he reported the first successful removal of a pineal tumor. He also coined the term \\"dystonia musculorum deformans\\" for a childhood torsion disease he described, which later became known as \\"Ziehen-Oppenheim syndrome\\" (named in conjunction with German psychiatrist Theodor Ziehen, 1862-1950). Additionally, amyotonia congenita is also known as \\"Oppenheim's disease\\" in his honor."},{"instruction":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: PIG DESTROYER - Terrifyer-This is some dark, twisted and evil music... yet I can't help but love it!

The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. Now, I have a new situation: David was visiting the natural history museum. He noticed two charts that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two time periods, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's overall climate in the sixteenth century when there were less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And time B showed earth's overall climate in the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. David found some interesting differences between these two charts. Answer this question please: Which period would see more trapped terrestrial radiation, time A or time B? Answer:","output":"Time B would see more trapped terrestrial radiation. This is because the present century (Time B) has a higher concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as compared to the sixteenth century (Time A). As a result, more terrestrial radiation is being absorbed and retained by the greenhouse gases during Time B, leading to an overall increase in global temperatures due to the enhanced greenhouse effect."},{"instruction":"Choose the next sentence.NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- India's child-rights watchdog has sought a report from police investigating allegations by a tabloid that the father of a \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" child star tried to sell her to an undercover reporter, the watchdog's leader told CNN.

Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines. But I can use this background: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] What is an answer for this question: Which lake has warmer water the bottom? A:","output":"Based on the given information and background, Deep Lake has warmer water at the bottom due to its geothermal activity. In the context of the two lakes, Deep Lake exhibits geothermal activity, which means it is influenced by the Earth's internal heat. This heat rises towards the surface and, in the case of Deep Lake, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This causes convection currents, as the warmer, less dense water rises and the cooler, denser water sinks, creating a continuous cycle. On the other hand, Shallow Lake has a mix of saline water with fresh water. While temperature variations can occur in this lake due to the different densities and solubilities of saline and fresh water, it is not mentioned that Shallow Lake has any source of geothermal activity like Deep Lake. This means that its deep water's temperatures will be influenced more by the surrounding environmental factors, and not by heat from within the Earth, which is the case in Deep Lake. In conclusion, Deep Lake has warmer water at the bottom due to the geothermal activity it experiences. This heat, originating from the Earth's interior, progressively warms the deeper waters of the lake and creates distinct thermoclines that divers experience when they descend through the water column. Meanwhile, Shallow Lake's water temperature is more influenced by the mixing of saline and fresh water, without a specific indication of geothermal activity making its deep water warmer compared to Deep Lake."},{"instruction":"Write an article that answers the following question: Who threw the longest touchdown pass of the game?","output":"Title: Reliving the Longest Touchdown Pass of the Game: A Moment of Glory Introduction In football, the touchdown pass is one of the most crucial and game-defining plays.

After the sediment has been moved by the combination of gravity and the fluid motion in which they're entrained, they eventually come to a stop when the forces transporting the sediment (like water currents or wind) are no longer strong enough to carry these particles. The locations where this happens are called 'depositional environments'. Depending on the system - it may be at the bottom of a body of water (such as a river, lake, sea, or ocean), or it may buildup on land (in the case of wind transport, e.g. sand dunes). This deposition over time forms sedimentary deposits, including sedimentary rocks once the deposits become compressed or cemented over extended periods. These deposited materials contribute to changes and shaping of our landscape over geologic time scales."},{"instruction":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The 5th Dimension is an American popular music vocal group, whose repertoire includes pop, R&B, soul, jazz, light opera and Broadway--the melange was coined as \\"Champagne Soul.\\" Formed as The Versatiles in late 1965, the group changed its name to the hipper \\"The 5th Dimension\\" by 1966. They became well-known during the late 1960s and early 1970s for their popular hits: \\"Up, Up and Away\\", \\"Stoned Soul Picnic\\", \\"Medley: Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures)\\", \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\", \\"Never My Love\\", \\"One Less Bell to Answer\\", \\"(Last Night) The members began rehearsing as the Versatiles in late 1965 and auditioned for Marc Gordon, who headed Motown's Los Angeles office. Although Motown rejected the group's demo tape, Gordon agreed to manage them and brought them to the attention of Johnny Rivers, who had just started his own label, Soul City Records. Their first Soul City single, \\"I'll Be Lovin' You Forever\\", was a successful single. In 1965 The Mamas & the Papas' first single, lead member John Phillips' \\"Go Where You Wanna Go\\", failed to open the foursome's chart career. At the suggestion of Rivers and their manager Marc Gordon, the 5th Dimension covered the same song virtually note-for-note (except for the last verse's upward modulation), and their early 1967 version climbed into the top 20 on R&B and pop stations and peaked at #16 on the Hot 100, opening the quintet's chart career. The budding songwriter Jimmy Webb supplied the group with their breakthrough hit, \\"Up, Up and Away\\", a mid-1967 #7 hit that won five Grammy Awards. The following year, the group scored major hit singles with Laura Nyro's songs \\"Stoned Soul Picnic\\" (U.S. #3) and \\"Sweet Blindness\\" (U.S. #13). The group received a gold record for their album Stoned Soul Picnic. That album included \\"California Soul\\", which peaked at #25 in February 1969. Weeks later the group's success broke wide open, with \\"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\\" from the musical Hair topping the Hot 100 for six straight weeks in April and May, and another Nyro song, \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\", doing the same for the first three full weeks in November. Their cover of Neil Sedaka's \\"Workin' On a Groovy Thing\\" went to #20 in between. Those four singles kept the group on the Hot 100 for all but four weeks in 1969. By some reckonings, \\"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\\" was the biggest hit single for 1969. Later top 20 hits included 1970's \\"One Less Bell to Answer\\" (U.S. #2), 1971's \\"Love's Lines, Angles and Rhymes\\" (U.S. #19) and \\"Never My Love\\" (U.S. #12), 1972's \\"(Last Night) I Didn't Get to Sleep at All\\" (U.S. #8) and \\"If I Could Reach You\\" (U.S. #10). The group had seven other top 40 hits, the last being 1973's \\"Living Together, Growing Together\\" (U.S. #32) from the film Lost Horizon.

He is a cute black kitty named Dillon. The cat is about two years old, and the family has had him for about a year. He is an indoor cat who is not allowed to go outside. The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten. Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders. When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws. Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread. The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes. But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can. Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away. He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers. The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns. The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread. They yell at him when he walks on the table. But Dillon does not listen. The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat. The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that's why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much!

Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"Intrinsic spinal circuits contain pattern generators that might help with actions beyond simple rhythmic movements. These pattern generators are responsible for producing rhythmic patterns of neural activity, which can be used to coordinate and control more complex movements.

However, the Bears tied the game with Michael Bush's 1-yard run to tie the game at 7-7. In the 2nd quarter, the Bears took the lead as Brandon Marshall caught a 3-yard touchdown pass from Jay Cutler to make the score 14-7.

What would have happened if I did not purchase the bundle deal ?","output":"If you had not purchased the bundle deal consisting of an 80GB PlayStation 3, Metal Gear Solid 4, and a Rumble Controller for 499, several factors would have come into play that may have impacted your gaming experience and overall satisfaction with your decision. Here's a detailed analysis of what could have happened: 1. Financial aspect: By choosing to buy the 40GB PlayStation 3 for 399, Metal Gear Solid 4 for 60, and the new Rumble Controller for 55 without the bundle, the total cost would amount to 514. In comparison to the bundle offer, you would have ended up paying 15 more. 2. Storage capacity: In terms of storage, you would have decided on a 40GB PlayStation 3 instead of the 80GB version offered in the bundle. Having half the storage capacity could have led to several inconveniences down the line: a) Limited game installations: With a smaller hard drive, you would have been able to store fewer game installations and updates. This might have required you to frequently delete and reinstall games to manage the available storage. b) Restricted multimedia storage: If you use your PlayStation 3 for storing movie and music files as well as game saves, reduced storage could have negatively impacted your multimedia storage capabilities. 3. Value for money: By opting for individual items instead of the bundle, you would have missed out on the added value that the bundle provides. The bundle offered an additional 40GB of storage as well as an included copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 and Rumble Controller, all at a lower price than purchasing the items separately. 4. Gaming experience: The bundle included a Rumble Controller, which is designed to provide tactile feedback during gameplay and enhance the overall gaming experience. If you had chosen not to purchase the bundle, you might have needed to buy this separately, ultimately adding to the overall cost. 5. Future upgrades: Should you have realized at a later date that you needed more storage or a better gaming experience, you might have considered upgrading your PlayStation 3 or accessories. This would have likely led to additional costs and the feeling of not getting the best initial deal. In conclusion, if you had not purchased the bundle deal, you would have spent more money on a separate console, game, and controller, while also having to manage reduced storage capacity. Additionally, the overall value for money would be lower, and you may have found yourself considering future upgrades to enhance your experience. By choosing the bundle deal, you have saved money, received a better gaming experience, and reduced the need for potential future upgrades."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: My love affair with technology began at an early age.

I have already mentioned the common names of the clause in your prompt: Necessary and Proper Clause, Elastic Clause, Basket Clause, Coefficient Clause, and Sweeping Clause. I cannot find any additional alternative names for this clause beyond those already provided. In summary, we have identified and reaffirmed the various names for Article 1, Section 8, Clause 18 of the United States Constitution, which are the Necessary and Proper Clause, Elastic Clause, Basket Clause, Coefficient Clause, and Sweeping Clause. It seems that these are the most widely recognized and used names for this particular clause."},{"instruction":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer. If yes, write \\"True\\", otherwise write \\"False\\". Question: how does gilgamesh consequently view his immortality Suggestion: The Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem from Mesopotamia , is amongst the earliest surviving works of literature . The answer to this question is:","output":"False. The suggested answer provided does not directly address the question about how Gilgamesh consequently views his immortality. Instead, the suggestion simply provides general information about \\"The Epic of Gilgamesh\\" being one of the earliest surviving works of literature from Mesopotamia. To give a more accurate and relevant answer to the question, we can dive into how Gilgamesh's viewpoint on immortality changes throughout the story: Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk and the protagonist of the epic, initially desires immortality due to his fear of death and overwhelming pride in his accomplishments. However, after witnessing the death of his friend Enkidu and encountering several trials during his quest for immortality, Gilgamesh begins to understand the limitations and reality of human life. Ultimately, Gilgamesh encounters Utnapishtim, a mortal who had been granted immortality by the gods. Utnapishtim shares with Gilgamesh the story of the great flood and how he attained immortality. Utnapishtim then presents an opportunity for Gilgamesh to obtain immortality by passing a test of sleeplessness. Gilgamesh fails the test and realizes that immortality is unattainable for mortals. In the end, Gilgamesh begins to accept his mortality and learns to appreciate his achievements and life in Uruk. He comes to understand that immortality is not granted to humans, and that they can only achieve a form of immortality through their lasting accomplishments and impact on others. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \\"how does Gilgamesh consequently view his immortality\\" would be: Gilgamesh learns to accept his mortality and realizes that humans can achieve a form of immortality through their lasting accomplishments, rather than pursuing literal immortality."},{"instruction":"Question: What treatment is Matthew undergoing?

Anger management is crucial for maintaining healthy relationships and overall mental well-being. Controlling anger and cultivating patience involves recognizing the triggers and developing appropriate coping mechanisms. Here are several strategies to control anger and develop patience: 1. Self-awareness: Understand the situations and emotions that trigger anger. Make a note of these situations and try to develop a plan to cope with them. 2. Take a break: When you feel anger building up, give yourself a moment to pause. Step away from the situation if possible, allowing yourself to cool down and reassess. 3. Practice deep breathing: Focusing on your breath helps you remain calm in stressful situations. Slow, deep breaths can help lower the heart rate and induce relaxation. 4. Use visualization: Picturing yourself in a calm and serene environment can help you develop a sense of peace and build patience. 5. Engage in physical activity: Exercise can help release pent-up emotions such as anger and frustration. Participate in activities like walking, jogging, or yoga to keep both your mind and body healthy. 6. Acknowledge and accept the feeling: Recognize that anger is a natural and common emotion. Confront and accept it, but do not let it control your actions. 7. Seek support: Discuss your anger-related concerns with trusted friends, family members, or a professional therapist. They can help you better manage your emotions and develop healthy coping strategies. 8. Establish clear communication: Express your feelings assertively, but not aggressively. Speak calmly and honestly about your emotions, using \\"I\\" statements. 9. Practice empathy: Consider other people's feelings and try to understand where they are coming from. This can help you develop patience and tolerance for others. 10. Set realistic expectations: Establish reasonable expectations for yourself and others, understanding that everyone has limitations. Accept that some things are beyond your control. 11. Apply problem-solving skills: Analyze the situation and identify possible solutions. Actively working towards a solution will decrease anger and increase patience. 12. Learn relaxation techniques: Apart from deep breathing, other relaxation techniques include meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness. Engage in these on a regular basis to help keep anger at bay. Remember that controlling anger and developing patience is an ongoing process.

The comparison made to CK Truth in candlelight further emphasizes the delicate and enticing nature of the scent. The reviewer does point out that if one prefers a fragrance that scents an entire room, this might not be a suitable choice. However, this is mentioned in a neutral tone, allowing readers to decide whether this aspect fits their preferences or not. The reviewer's lighthearted tone and their use of \\"LOL\\" can be interpreted as a genuine appreciation for the fragrance and a sincere attempt to describe its unique qualities. In conclusion, this review is undoubtedly positive, as the reviewer shares their admiration for the perfect fragrance, its characteristics, and versatility. They provide helpful information for potential buyers, allowing them to make an informed decision based on their preferences. While there is a mention of the scent's subtlety and limited sillage, this observation only serves to enhance the overall appeal of the fragrance for those who prefer a more personal and intimate scent experience."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"Ha! said the old gentleman, surveying him apoplectically.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The old man never saw him.\\" is true (see options)?

One of the chimps escapes using the warfare tactics he was being trained for. Dr. Angelo is generally a pacifist, who would rather explore the intelligence-enhancing potential of his research without applying it for military purposes. His wife Caroline is unhappy with the way he is ignoring her to focus on this project. Jobe Smith, a local greenskeeper with an intellectual disability, lives in the garden shed owned by the local priest, Father Francis McKeen. McKeen's brother, Terry, is a local landscape gardener and employs Jobe to help him with odd jobs. Father McKeen punishes the challenged Jobe with a belt whenever he fails to complete his chores. Dr. Angelo realizes he needs a human subject to work with, and he spots Jobe mowing his lawn. Peter Parkette, Dr. Angelo's young neighbor, is friends with Jobe. Dr. Angelo invites both of them over to play some virtual reality games. Learning more about Jobe, Angelo persuades him to participate in his experiments, letting him know it will make him smarter. Jobe agrees and begins the program. Dr. Angelo makes it a point to redesign all the intelligence-boosting treatments without the \\"aggression factors\\" used in the chimpanzee experiments.

The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.Without speaking directly of death, both verses indicate the absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.The melody of the song is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its combination of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody is similar to the patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, the music begins in the key of G major with an Andante Moderato tempo. The verses follow a chord progression of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, it is clear that the second verse of the ballad about the Wabash River talks about missing a loved one. This verse revolves around the narrator's lost love, Mary. The narrator's expressions of grief and sadness are evident, as well as his inability to cope with the loss. There is a mention of his reluctance to come near her grave, which demonstrates his difficulty in dealing with her absence. The ballad's overall theme focuses on reminiscing about events that occurred near the Wabash River, flowing through Indiana. The first verse, meanwhile, centers on the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. Although it does not directly discuss missing a loved one like the second verse, it still indicates the absence of a loved one and nostalgia for the past. As for the chorus, the narrative is detached from the verses in terms of content, but it shares a nostalgic and reminiscing tone, which is a common theme throughout the ballad. The melody and musical structure of the song play a significant role in creating its memorable and easy-to-learn tune through a combination of harmonic repetition and contrast. These elements help to avoid monotony while making the song accessible to a wide audience. In summary, the second verse of the ballad about the Wabash River is the one that talks about missing a loved one, specifically, the narrator's lost love, Mary. The first verse and the chorus also share nostalgia and reminiscing tones, albeit discussing different subjects and not directly addressing the absence of a loved one like the second verse does."},{"instruction":"Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph (born October 22, 1992), better known by his stage name 21 Savage, is an American rapper from Atlanta, Georgia.

The answer is:","output":"The composer who is widely recognized for using sound mass in his compositions is György Ligeti. György Ligeti was a Hungarian-Austrian composer and one of the most influential avant-garde composers of the 20th century. He was born on May 28, 1923, and passed away on June 12, 2006. Sound mass, also known as texture music or cloud music, is a compositional technique in which musical elements such as pitch, rhythm, and timbre are deemphasized in favor of dense, complex constructions of sound. This results in music with an emphasis on timbral variety, creating a sense of undifferentiated, shifting sound textures. Ligeti's work with sound mass began in the late 1950s and continued throughout the 1960s. His most famous work to employ this technique is \\"Atmosphères\\" for orchestra, which was composed in 1961. \\"Atmosphères\\" features rich, densely layered orchestration that creates an otherworldly, almost ethereal quality to the piece. Another notable composition that uses sound mass is his \\"Requiem\\", composed between 1963 and 1965, which is a powerful and monumental work that combines traditional choral writing with abstract, dissonant clusters of sound. Other composers who have worked with sound mass techniques include Krzysztof Penderecki, Iannis Xenakis, and Edgard Varèse."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a statement written in Panjabi.

The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic. - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938 November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. - Augustus \`\` Gussie '' Clarke ( born 1953 ) is a reggae producer who worked with some of the top Jamaican reggae artists in the 1970s and later set up his own Music Works studio . - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada.

After tinkering with it, I've come to some conclusions: Modeling the economy is a mug's game, short-term interest rates are a poor tool for steering the economy, and I should never be given the job of running a central bank. The website sets out the objectives: Your job is to set monetary policy to achieve full employment and low price inflation. Your term will last four years (16 quarters). Keep unemployment close to its natural rate of 5 percent. Keep inflation near the Fed's 2 percent inflation target. Pay attention to the headlines for information about the economy. The game begins in mid-2020 with the kind of Goldilocks economy that any incoming central bank chief would happily trade their housing allowance for. Inflation is not too hot and not too cold, at 2.1 percent, a level the current Fed hasn't enjoyed for more than two years. Unemployment has been ticking lower for five consecutive quarters and is just 4.7 percent, a smidgen below the 5 percent level that the game says is the \\"natural\\" rate and in line with today's 4.9 percent number. But the benchmark Fed funds rate has remained constant at 4 percent throughout that imagined future period -- a far cry from the current upper bound of 0.5 percent. So what's an incoming central bank chair to do? Leave well enough alone, of course. Luckily, there are no pesky dissenters to worry about in my monetary dictatorship, no gravitational pull from a zero bound that I'm philosophically anxious to escape, and so my decision to leave rates on hold is unchallenged. The following quarter sees the jobless rate inch down to 4.6 percent, while inflation speeds up a bit to 2.3 percent. Neither seem particularly worrisome -- because consumer price gains were below the Fed target throughout 2015 and 2016, letting them off the leash for a while seems defensible -- so I'll do what the Fed did last week in the real world and keep rates unchanged again. \\"Help Wanted Signs Everywhere,\\" say the resulting news headlines. \\"Tight job market suggests more inflation ahead.\\" Inflation speeds up to 2.5 percent, while the jobless rate drops to 4.4 percent. Should being so far below the so-called natural jobless rate bother me, the way the labor market seems to currently preoccupy Yellen? Well, in March 2014, the Fed abandoned the idea that a decline below 6.5 percent would be enough to trigger higher borrowing costs. Unemployment has been below 6 percent since October 2014, and yet the Fed has only tweaked its rate higher once, with the current 4.9 percent level not enough to spur action this month. So, in the game, I stick with that playbook, and keep rates on hold for my third consecutive quarter. In fact, in recognition of the challenge that being \\"data dependent\\" is meaningless if you start ignoring the data when it doesn't do what you expect, I'm planning to stand pat on policy all the way until the middle of 2021. The game tries to interfere with my plans, throwing out what it says is a tax refund for millions of people. (It might instead have had the government taking advantage of stable borrowing costs to boost infrastructure spending, but it seems that much-needed approach is too much to hope for even in fantasy land.) Could this be helicopter money, conjured out of thin air by the central bank rather than coming from existing central government funds? I don't remember authorizing that! The game doesn’t say; but with inflation surging past 3.3 percent and the jobless rate down to close to 3 percent, the economic temperature is definitely rising. Back in July 2009, when the current Fed chair Janet Yellen was merely head of the San Francisco branch, she said keeping rates near zero for several years was \\"not outside the realm of possibility.\\" Thus it proved. Yellen took charge of the Fed in Feb. 2014; she didn't oversee her first rate change until December 2015. So, taking my cue from her, I ignore the game's September 2021 newspaper headlines \\"Fed Expected to Tighten to Restrain Economy,\\" even as consumer price gains rocket past 4.4 percent. By the time I'm willing to entertain a rate increase in March 2022 after 20 months at the helm, it's probably too late. Unemployment is 1.5 percent, and has been for months -- the game seems to believe it's impossible for it to drop below that lower bound. Inflation, though, is at a pace not seen since the early 1980s, nudging 7 percent. \\"Economy Too Hot!\\" says the newspaper. \\"Uncontrolled Economic Boom Signals Trouble.\\" The paper is almost definitely preparing my obituary as Fed chief. Suppose I govern differently from the beginning. It turns out that life's not much better if I start my term by immediately driving the Fed funds rate down to its current 0.5 percent level. Unemployment quickly drops to that 1.5 percent floor, while inflation surges past 4.4 percent. And no matter how many times I click on the \\"Cut\\" button, the game won't let me introduce the negative interest rates prevalent in so many of the world's monetary jurisdictions. In a virtual sense, I'm unique in having served two online terms as Internet Fed chair. I'm no better at it than I was at the start of 2008, when I played the Fed's virtual game using Ben Bernanke's playbook as my guide. Then, a Fed funds level of 1 percent -- back before ZIRP and NIRP were even a gleam in the eyes of unconventional economists -- was enough to drive inflation to double-digit crisis levels. (Soon after the article I wrote then was published, the game disappeared from the Internet. I've only just rediscovered it.) The game's changes suggest that the experience of the past decade has changed how economists view the interaction between policy and outcomes. I draw three conclusions from my experience running the Fed in a virtual world. Firstly, modeling is bunkum, because the real world has so many variables that aren't interacting the way economics textbooks say they should. At no point does the Fed's admittedly simplistic web game tell us what growth is doing, or how wages are performing relative to inflation. Whichever model a central bank employs will always be an imperfect snapshot of the economy. And the growing debate, fueled in part by Fed officials themselves, about whether inflation targets need to be higher, what the true non-accelerating rate of inflation is, and whether targeting gross domestic product makes more sense, illustrates how hard it is to choose what to target. Secondly, central banks cannot and should not be expected to do all of the work; there's only so much monetary policy can achieve to resuscitate growth without parallel action on the fiscal front from government. The Bank of Japan's decision last week to shift its focus to keeping 10-year yields from dropping below zero percent suggests the typical central bank focus on short-term borrowing costs ignores the effect on the banking industry of longer-term rates. And thirdly, I'm glad I'm not actually in charge of steering the global economy. I am increasingly sympathetic toward our central bankers; they may have more sophisticated tools than the simulator after embracing unconventional policies, but their jobs are still more difficult than most people imagine.

Starting in mid-2020, the game sets the challenge of balancing full employment and low price inflation throughout a four-year term while adhering to the natural rate of unemployment and the Fed's 2 percent inflation target. Throughout the game, the author grapples with various economic developments, such as shifts in inflation and unemployment, as well as the challenge of making decisions based on the ever-changing economic data. They also experience the limits of monetary policy, as the game demonstrates the difficulty of managing an economy strictly through adjusting short-term interest rates. In the end, the author draws three conclusions from their virtual experience as the Fed Chair: 1. Modeling the economy is highly challenging due to the numerous unpredictable variables in the real world, and the limitations of basing decisions on economic textbook theories. 2. Central banks cannot and should not be solely responsible for managing an economy; fiscal policy also plays a crucial role in supporting growth and stability. 3. The role of central bankers is more difficult than most people imagine, and the author expresses sympathy for those who take on the responsibility of guiding the global economy. Overall, the article offers insights into the complex nature of economic management through monetary policy and highlights the importance of balancing fiscal and monetary tools to maintain a stable, thriving economy."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Context: \\"Legend tells of a legendary warrior whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend...\\" A mysterious panda donning a flowing cape and sedge hat walks through the Chinese landscape. Reputed to be a grand master of kung fu, he enters a tavern where he is immediately attacked by the local ruffians. However, they are no match for his skill and even the legendary kung fu masters, the Furious Five, bow down to the panda's skill, requesting to hang out with him and fight alongside him as......Po the giant panda (Jack Black) wakes up from his dream in his room. His goose father, Mr. Ping (James Hong) calls to him from the noodle restaurant below to help serve tables. Po admires his Furious Five action figures before going downstairs. An extreme fan of Kung Fu, Po dreams of one day becoming a master worthy of fighting alongside the Five but his girth and clumsiness makes this dream simply a dream and his kung fu talents reside only within his knowledge of moves and artifacts. He is hesitant to express his desires to his dad who is more interested in running his restaurant and advertising his famous 'secret ingredient soup'.Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), a red panda who resides at the Jade Palace temple, practices kung fu in the courtyard with his students, the Furious Five; Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Mantis (Seth Rogen), before he is summoned to see tortoise Grand Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim). Fearing something is wrong, Shifu rushes to find him meditating in the grand hall. Oogway doesn't deny bad news but calmly tells Shifu he's predicted that the snow leopard warrior Tai Lung (Ian McShane) will escape prison and return to the Valley of Peace to wreak destruction once again. Intent on never letting this happen, Shifu sends his goose messenger, Zeng (Dan Fogler), to fly to Chor-Gom Prison to ensure that security is increased. Oogway then proclaims that it is time to choose the Dragon Warrior; a master of great skill who will be granted the secrets of the universe by reading the Dragon Scroll, kept delicately out of reach on the temple ceiling. Assuming that one of the Furious Five will be chosen, Shifu prepares a competition to determine which one will qualify.Flyers for the competition are spread throughout town and the villagers flock to the temple. Excited to have the opportunity to see his idols in person, Po follows with his noodle cart in tow but struggles on the long staircase to the temple. He is the last to arrive at the gates and finds that they've shut him out. In a desperate bid to see the competition before it's over, Po fashions fireworks to his cart and blasts himself high into the air, only to come crashing down in the arena just as Oogway is preparing to choose out of the Five. Po opens his eyes to see Oogway's finger pointed right at him and is shocked, along with everyone else, when he is proclaimed to be the Dragon Warrior. Oogway's decision is final, despite Shifu's protests, and Po is carried (unsuccessfully) into the temple leaving Tigress greatly disappointed since it seemed Oogway would have chosen her if Po hadn't arrived.Inside the temple, Po examines, with awe, the many weaponry and valuable artifacts before Shifu approaches him and berates him for his obvious lack of skill. He deflates Po's excitement by grabbing his finger in what Po recognizes as the Wuxi Finger Hold, reputed to be extremely powerful. Shifu promises that Po will regret ever being chosen before taking him to the Fives training room where Po is promptly put to the test. Nervous, but excited to try some kung fu moves, Po accepts the challenge but is hurtled, flung, and beaten down to a now-existing Level 0.On the way to the dormitories, Po overhears the Five poke fun at his incompetence. He has an awkward conversation with Crane, opening up to his own doubts of being the Dragon Warrior. Tigress assures his doubts, calling him a disgrace to kung fu and tells Question: What kind of animal is Grand Master Oogway?

After the Jaguars deferred the opening coin toss, the Patriots received the opening kickoff to begin a 10-play, 82-yard drive. On a 1st-and-goal run from the Jaguars' 1-yard line, Maroney fumbled before breaking the plane of the goal line; it was recovered by Jaguars linebacker Daryl Smith at the 1-yard line. The Jaguars reached their own 35-yard line on their ensuing possession before failing to convert on a fourth down attempt, turning the ball back over the Patriots. Two plays after a 21-yard Morris run, Brady and Moss connected on a 2-yard touchdown reception to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. After the kickoff, the Jaguars drove to the Patriots' 42-yard line before a David Garrard pass intended for Marcedes Lewis was intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 17-yard line and returned 56 yards. Two plays later, on the first play of the second quarter, Brady threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Baker to extend the Patriots' lead to 14-0. The Jaguars continued to move the ball on their next possession, reaching midfield on completions of 15 and 14 yards; however a false start penalty negated another 15-yard reception and the Jaguars were forced to punt. Following a Patriots' three-and-out, Garrard was strip-sacked by Banta-Cain on the first play of the Jaguars' next-drive; tackle Eben Britton recovered the fumble for the Jaguars, who punted three plays later. On the third play of their ensuing drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 55-yard Morris run, and later took a 21-0 lead on a 1-yard Morris touchdown run. After another Jaguars three-and-out, the Patriots moved into Jaguars territory on a 29-yard Welker catch and later extended their lead to 28-0 on a 6-yard touchdown reception by Moss. This would remain the score after the Jaguars ended the half on another punt. The Jaguars began the second half with a 16-play, 69-yard drive that took over eight minutes off the clock; however, it ended without any points after Garrard was intercepted by Springs at the Patriots' 2-yard line on a 3rd-and-goal from the 5-yard line. The Patriots responded with a 10-play, 90-yard drive of their own, despite a false start penalty to begin it. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Brady hit Moss on his third touchdown catch of the game, putting the Patriots ahead 35-0. However, the Jaguars responded quickly, moving past midfield on a 22-yard Rashad Jennings run and into the red zone on a 20-yard Nate Hughes reception. Two plays later, Garrard scrambled two yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 35-7. With 12:41 remaining in the game, the Patriots received the ball after the kickoff. What ensued was a 20-play drive, with the Patriots reaching midfield with about ten minutes remaining in the game, and reaching the Jaguars' 10-yard line by the two-minute warning. The drive included five first downs, including two off fourth down conversions. One play after the two-minute warning, Hoyer replaced Brady at quarterback, and one play later, the Patriots turned the ball over on downs after a failed 4th-and-2 run by Morris. The Jaguars, with 29 seconds left in the game, ran one play to end the game.

The move by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education is the latest blow for the beleaguered university, which has seen its reputation clobbered and its football program hobbled after investigators found school leaders did too little to stop the abuse. Were the commission to pull Penn State's accreditation -- which it has not done -- the school would face the loss of eligibility for federal student aid programs, guaranteed student loans, federal research grants and could lose eligibility for state aid, commission spokesman Richard Pockrass said in July. Paterno family wants to appeal Penn State sanctions. Penn State will resolve the commission's concerns, promised Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Blannie Bowen. \\"This action has nothing to do with the quality of education our students receive,\\" Bowen said in a statement posted Monday to the school's website. \\"Middle States is focusing on governance, integrity and financial issues related to information in the Freeh report and other items related to our current situation.\\" The commission voted August 6 to place the school on warning status. Two days later, it notified Penn State officials that the school's accreditation was \\"in jeopardy\\" based on information contained in former FBI Director Louis Freeh's report on Penn State's handling of the sex-abuse allegations against Sandusky and a National Collegiate Athletic Association action against the school. Freeh found that Penn State's leadership showed \\"total and consistent disregard\\" for youths sexually abused by Sandusky, the former assistant football coach convicted by a jury in June on 45 counts involving child sex abuse. He is scheduled to be sentenced in September. Among other things, authorities say school officials failed to properly address a report that Sandusky had been seen in a football complex shower, apparently engaged in sexual contact with a young boy. Timeline of the Penn State scandal. Last month, the NCAA fined Penn State 60 million, banned the football program from bowl games for four years, stripped scholarships and took away the team's wins from 1998 to 2011. The commission also said it had insufficient evidence that Penn State officials had followed commission rules about how schools are to be governed and whether it had provided \\"accurate, fair and complete information\\" about what was happening at the school, according to the letter. The commission asked Penn State to report by September 30 on the steps it is taking to ensure full compliance with accreditation requirements, as well as information about the school's financial capacity to meet ongoing obligations considering the potential fallout from civil lawsuits expected over the scandal. A team assembled by the commission will visit Penn State after the September report to evaluate the school's performance, the commission said. Bowen said the commission \\"wants us to document that steps we have already taken and are planning to take will ensure our full compliance with its requirements\\" and emphasized that the school expects no loss of accreditation. \\"It is critical to emphasize that Middle States does not issue a warning unless the commission believes that an institution has the capacity to make appropriate improvements within a reasonable period and then sustain itself to stay in compliance,\\" Bowen said in the statement. \\"This certainly is true for Penn State. We're confident that our monitoring report and the site visit will confirm this to the commission.\\" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the warning seemed to be a bit of \\"piling on\\" in light of the sanctions already in place against Penn State.

Let's break down the two solutions and evaluate their effectiveness, practicality, and long-term benefits. 1. Using an air freshener spray: Air freshener sprays are a popular and easily accessible method for making a room smell nice quickly. Let's consider the advantages and disadvantages of using an air freshener spray: Advantages: - Provides an immediate effect, which is ideal in situations when you need to improve the room's scent quickly - Wide variety of scents available - Easy to use and portable – can be taken with you and used as needed - Affordable and can be found in most supermarkets or convenience stores Disadvantages: - Temporary solution; the fragrance fades away within a few hours - Potentially harmful chemicals found in some air fresheners might trigger allergies or respiratory issues in sensitive individuals or those with pre-existing health conditions - Overuse of air fresheners may result in an overpowering scent or a mix of unpleasant smells - Environmental concerns; aerosol sprays have been linked to contributing to air pollution and climate change 2. Placing plants in the room: Introducing plants in the room is a more natural and aesthetically pleasing approach to making a room smell nice. Here are the advantages and disadvantages of placing plants in a room: Advantages: - More natural, environmentally friendly approach to improving the air quality - Some plants can purify the air and remove harmful chemicals - Provides a visually appealing and calming environment - Longer lasting option; plants can provide a pleasant scent continuously as long as they are well-maintained - May have a positive impact on mood and mental well-being Disadvantages: - Requires ongoing maintenance, such as watering and proper positioning of the plant based on its light requirements - Allergens, such as pollen, might be a concern for those susceptible to allergies - Limited choice of fragrances compared to air fresheners - May take longer to create a significant change in room's scent compared to air fresheners - Some plants can be toxic to pets or children if ingested In conclusion, the choice between using an air freshener spray and placing plants in the room largely depends on your individual preferences and circumstances. If you require a quick and easy but temporary solution, air freshener sprays might be more suitable. However, if you prefer a more natural and environmentally friendly option that provides long-term benefits, placing plants in the room would be a better choice. In either case, exploring a combination of both methods, or periodic ventilation of the room to maintain fresh air circulation, can further enhance the effectiveness of the chosen solution."},{"instruction":"Would a linguist find the following sentence to be a valid English sentence grammatically?

When David's former lover, Julianna \\"Julie\\" Gianni (Cameron Diaz), hears of Sofia, she attempts to kill herself and David in a car crash. Julie dies but David survives, his face grotesquely disfigured,[4] leading him to wear a mask to hide the injuries. With no hope to use plastic surgery to repair the damage, David cannot come to grips with the idea of wearing the mask for the rest of his life. On a night out with Sofia and Brian, David gets hopelessly drunk and Sofia and Brian leave David to wallow in the street outside. David is awakened the next day in the street by Sofia, who apologises for deserting him the night before, and takes him home. The two continue to see each other, and David has his face surgically repaired despite being told it was impossible before. Though his life seems perfectly content, David finds oddities, such as brief visions of his distorted face, and a man (Noah Taylor) at a bar that tells him David can control the world and everyone in it, if he wanted to. One day, when he goes to Sofia's apartment, he finds Julie there instead; all of the previous mementos of Sofia now show Julie's face. Angry and confused, David suffocates Julie, and is later arrested and placed in a mental institution, finding his face has reverted to its previously disfigured state. David completes telling his story to Curtis, who proceeds to then visit David further for more sessions to try to help him recuperate. During...

Buffalo Springfield was a Canadian-American rock band active from 1966 to 1968 whose most prominent members were Stephen Stills, Neil Young, and Richie Furay. The band released three albums and several singles, including \\"For What It's Worth\\". The band combined elements of folk and country music with British invasion and psychedelic-rock influences, and, along with the Byrds, were part of the early development of folk-rock. With a name taken from a brand of steamroller, Buffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Dewey Martin (drums, vocals), Bruce Palmer (electric bass), Furay (guitar, vocals), and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals). Chris Hillman of the Byrds persuaded the owners of the Whisky a Go Go to give Buffalo Springfield an audition, and they essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band's reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds' lighting manager) to become involved in the group's management. In turn, Davis sought advice from Sonny & Cher's management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group's tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records for a four-album contract with a 12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with Elektra Records and Warner Bros. Records, and arranged for the band to start recording at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood. The first Buffalo Springfield single, \\"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing\\", was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the Top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own mono mix was superior to the stereo mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band's eponymous album was released by the Atlantic subsidiary Atco in mono and in stereo in December 1966. A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year. In November 1966, Stills composed \\"For What It's Worth\\" in response to a protest that had turned into a riot following the closing of a nightclub called Pandora's Box on Sunset Strip. The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station KHJ soon afterwards. By March 1967, it was a Top Ten hit. Atco took advantage of this momentum by replacing the song \\"Baby Don't Scold Me\\" with \\"For What It's Worth\\" and re-releasing the album. \\"For What It's Worth\\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc., Entity:","output":"Buffalo Springfield"},{"instruction":"What is a random fact?","output":"A random fact is a piece of information that is true, often surprising, and not widely known. It is typically unrelated to the current topic of conversation and serves as an interesting tidbit to share with others. With countless topics and subjects to explore, random facts can be drawn from various fields like science, history, nature, and more. For instance, did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have discovered pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible! This remarkable characteristic of honey is due to its unique composition and chemical properties. Honey is a natural sweetener that bees create by collecting nectar from flowers. Once they return to their hive, they regurgitate the nectar and pass it on to other bees, who then store it in honeycomb cells. The bees proceed to fan the nectar with their wings, evaporating much of the water content and transforming it into a thick, sticky substance known as honey. The low water content of honey plays a key role in its longevity. It creates an environment that is inhospitable for the growth of microorganisms, as they are unable to survive in such highly concentrated sugar solutions. Additionally, honey has a naturally acidic pH, which further inhibits the growth of bacteria and other pathogens. Another factor contributing to honey's eternal shelf-life is the presence of an enzyme called glucose oxidase. Bees introduce this enzyme to honey when collecting and regurgitating the flower nectar. In the presence of oxygen, glucose oxidase breaks down glucose (a sugar in honey) into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide, a well-known antimicrobial agent, helps to kill off any bacteria or other microorganisms that might be present. So, if you ever find yourself enjoying a spoonful of honey, remember this fascinating random fact: you are consuming a natural food product that has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years and will continue to last indefinitely as long as it remains sealed from moisture and other contaminants."},{"instruction":"Write a title for this article: In January 2009, SEC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Brenda Murray found that securities industry lawyer Steven Altman had engaged in unethical and improper professional conduct while representing a prospective witness for the Division of Enforcement (“Division”) in a SEC administrative proceeding. In the Matter of Steven Altman, Esq (Initial Decision Release No. 367, Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-12944, January 14, 2009). The ALJ’s Initial Decision sought to deny Altman the privilege of appearing before the SEC for a period of nine months. According to the ALJ’s Initial Decision, in January 2009, Altman was a forty-six year old graduate of Boston University and New York Law School, a member of the New York State Bar, and had been practicing law since 1987. Altman maintained an office in Manhattan where he employed one salaried attorney, who handled the paperwork, while Altman spent his time litigating commercial disputes in courts and before the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Altman did not have an extensive practice before the SEC. Altman was married in 1987 and divorced in 1999. He testified that he provided financial support for three children, and his fiancée and her child with whom he lived. Altman maintained that in January and February 2004, he was working ten to fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, drinking very heavily, and in a contentious relationship with his ex-wife who has custody of his seven year old twins with whom he has a close relationship. On March 30, 2008, Altman admitted himself to a hospital where he was diagnosed with alcohol and cocaine abuse. He left a twenty-eight day program on April 7, 2008, after eight days and began participating in an out-patient program at a different facility. On May 6, 2008, Altman testified that, since April 8, 2008, he had participated in the out-patient program four days a week and has attended meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous daily. The Initial Decision found that Altman offered to have a client evade the Division’s service of a subpoena and/or testify falsely in exchange for a financial package from two respondents in the proceeding. The ALJ further found that Altman did so with scienter, and, as a result of his conduct, he violated Disciplinary Rules (“DR”) 1-102(A)(4), 102(A)(5), and 102(A)(7) of the New York State Bar Association Lawyer’s Code of Professional Responsibility. Pursuant to Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the SEC’s Rules of Practice and Section 4C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the ALJ suspended Altman from appearing or practicing before the SEC for nine months. Nine Months Not Enough Say OGC The SEC’s Office of the General Counsel (“OGC”) appealed the nine-month suspension imposed on Altman in the Initial Decision, and sought an order permanently denying him the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission. According to the SEC, Altman had known Bonnie Rosen since he was in high school and she worked at a local insurance agency. From November 1999 to October 2003, Rosen worked as an administrative assistant with a salary of 60,000 at Nextgen Inc. (“Nextgen”), a company that was owned by Jay Adoni and shared office space with Harrison Securities, Inc. (“Harrison”), a broker-dealer. Nextgen paid Rosen’s salary, but she spent half of her time working for Harrison and its chief executive officer, Frederick C. Blumer, who was Adoni’s close business associate. Sometime in 2003, Rosen called Altman and told him that she had been forced out of her job at Nextgen. Rosen asked Altman for his help in obtaining severance pay from Nextgen and removing her name from two car leases she co-signed for Blumer, who used the cars and paid the leases. Altman testified that he agreed to assist Rosen as a “favor.” Altman twice contacted Adoni and requested that he pay Rosen severance and remove her name from the car leases. On both occasions, Adoni refused the requests. In 2003, the Division instituted administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Harrison, Blumer, and Nebrissa Song, alleging violations of the Exchange Act’s books and records, net capital, and financial reporting provisions (hereinafter the “Harrison Proceeding”). Respondents raised as a defense to the books and records charge that they were unable to maintain the firm’s general ledger for certain periods because a computer virus corrupted their files. A hearing in the Harrison Proceeding was held on January 20 through January 26, 2004 and March 8 through 10, 2004. Division Wants to Talk to Rosen On January 26, 2004, Division staff learned from NASD staff that Rosen had called NASD and claimed to have information adverse to Harrison’s and Blumer’s computer virus defense. Division staff hoped, but were not sure, that Rosen would be able to testify that there was no computer virus that compromised Harrison’s files. Division staff also thought that Rosen might be able to testify about Blumer’s accounting practices. Division staff concluded that Rosen might be a good rebuttal witness. Division staff called Rosen on January 28, 2004 and told her that they learned she might have useful information for the Harrison Proceeding. They asked Rosen if she would be willing to meet or speak with them. Rosen expressed some anxiety about testifying. She mentioned to Division staff that she co-signed two car leases for Blumer, and she was concerned that if Blumer was ordered to pay a civil penalty in the Harrison Proceeding, it might increase the likelihood that he would default on the leases and she would have to pay the remaining balance on the leases. Division staff testified that the car leases were not relevant to their case and were not a subject of interest to them, except insofar as the leases might prevent Rosen from testifying in the Harrison Proceeding. Rosen identified Altman as her attorney and referred Division staff to him. Altman Speaks to Division As Rosen’s Lawyer On or about January 28, 2004, Division staff spoke with Altman, who identified himself as Rosen’s legal representative. During the conversation, Division staff described the nature of the Harrison Proceeding, indicated that it was ongoing, and expressed their interest in possibly using Rosen’s testimony as part of their case. Division staff asked Altman if they could interview Rosen. Division staff testified that Altman was “noncommital” about whether Rosen would agree to an interview and said that he would get back to them. Altman asked Division staff who was representing Harrison and Blumer, and they gave him Irving Einhorn’s name. The SEC concluded that Altman first called Einhorn on or about January 28, 2004. In this conversation, Altman told Einhorn that he represented Rosen and that the Division was interested in possibly using her as a witness in the Harrison Proceeding. Altman also told Einhorn that Rosen had left Nextgen under unfavorable circumstances with little or no severance pay; she had worked for Harrison and Blumer; and she was hostile towards them. Altman gave Einhorn an abbreviated version of his discussions with Adoni and said he thought this would be an opportune time to reinvigorate Rosen’s requests for severance pay and removal of her name from the car leases. In his hearing testimony and briefs on appeal, Altman admitted that the Division’s interest in Rosen as a witness gave him some leverage to renew her requests. Einhorn testified that he decided to tape record their subsequent conversations because he believed Altman was engaging in an “extortion attempt” and wanted to protect himself and his clients in the event Rosen testified in the Harrison Proceeding “without being paid off.” Einhorn did not tell Altman that he was taping their conversations, and Altman was unaware that he was being taped. In a taped telephone conversation on February 2, 2004, the following discussion ensued: MR. ALTMAN: I am not going to pull punches with you. They [Division staff] are aware[,] if asked, [Rosen] will testify that there was no virus in the computer,10 and I suspect once they start peeling it away, some other very, very unhelpful stuff with respect to the books and records of the firm – MR. ALTMAN: As I understand it, [b]ased on her personal knowledge, . . . it was a small suite of executive offices that they all sat in. MR. ALTMAN: And that this was not just a professional relationship, it was personal, not, not in any – MR. EINHORN: Not a sexual or intimate way. MR. ALTMAN: Not an intimate way, but a personal basis. And, listen, when you have a 60,000 a year secretary co-signing for cars of a president of a firm, it . . . raises eyebrows initially.11 Frankly, probably all this would have gone away if at least something would have happened,12 but, you know, if that’s Fred’s [Blumer] view, that is — you know, it shouldn’t have gone forward. MR. EINHORN: No, no, no, I am here, Steven, trying to figure out what’s happening here. So, she hasn’t given that testimony? MR. ALTMAN: That’s correct. She is not a registered rep[resentative] so she is not at risk of losing her license if she doesn’t appear any place. MR. EINHORN: Well, suppose she gets a subpoena to appear at the hearing? MR. ALTMAN: Well, you know[,] if she gets served, then, you know, she is going to be [like] any other human being. I, of course, can’t advise her to evade the [subpoena] process, but . . . [m]emory fades and the like.13 And you know[,] I don’t know. MR. EINHORN: So, what you are saying is[,] if they reach some agreement, she would be more favorably inclined? MR. ALTMAN: That would be my guess as to what her recollection would be, you know.14 I don’t have the personal knowledge, and I haven’t done a full debriefing of her. I know Fred, I met him, as he may have told you. MR. EINHORN: Yeah, no, [Fred] told me he likes you. MR. ALTMAN: I like him. He is a nice guy. This is all silly. I hate to see this happen. Really, it would be terrible. MR. ALTMAN: If somebody just does the right thing,15 and MR. EINHORN: But you think they learned about this from others and were pointed to her. They have other people lined up that are MR.ALTMAN: No, no. I don’t think that is the case. MR. EINHORN: You don’t think they have other people coming to testify? MR. ALTMAN: No, no, not with respect to what I talked to you about. MR. ALTMAN: I think if you cut it off with her, then it is closed. 16 That will be[,] you know[,] killing themselves. You can read the additional taped conversations at http://sec.gov/litigation/opinions/2010/34-63306.pdf After the hearing in the Harrison Proceeding, Einhorn withdrew as counsel for Harrison and Blumer and disclosed the tapes to law enforcement authorities. In September 2004, the ALJ in the Harrison Proceeding issued an initial decision finding that Harrison and Blumer had violated the federal securities laws, but that Rosen had been “thoroughly impeached” on cross-examination and was not a reliable witness. The SEC’s Opinon on Appeal Following appeal, the SEC independently reviewed the case and found that Altman had engaged in unethical and improper professional conduct while representing a prospective witness in an SEC administrative proceeding, in violation of state bar disciplinary rules. In a rare move, the SEC permanently denied Altman the privilege of appearing or practicing before the SEC. In the Matter of Steven Altman, Esq, (Securities Exchange Act Of 1934 Rel. No. 63306 / Admin. Proc. File No. 3-12944, November 10, 2010). On December 9, 2010, the Courthouse News Service (CNS) published an article titled: Attorney Declares War on SEC. The CNS story states that Attorney Steven Altman sued the SEC in Federal Court, claiming the agency “has wrongfully sought to ‘federalize’ the subject of attorney ethics discipline” – a function of state judiciaries – by its Nov. 10 order permanently barring him from “appearing or practicing (law) before the Commission.” According to CNS, Altman claims that “there is absolutely no statutory authority granting the Commission to unilaterally apply part or even all of the New York State Disciplinary Rules to anyone.” Moreover, the lawyer does not view his action as an appeal of the SEC’s Opinion and Order but rather a “facial attack on the Commission’s jurisdiction to bring the [underlying] proceeding.” CNS says that Altman argues that he has been “vilified by the Commission and in effect been accused of being and found to be unfit to practice law at all, a conclusion which is not in any way supported by and contrary to his record.” Altman alleges that the SEC’s action was an ”unconstitutional usurpation of the New York State Disciplinary Rules,” and he concludes that such improper action violated his right to equal protection, due process and privacy. Altman seeks to enjoin the SEC’s Order against him. Altman’s Complaint pointedly dismisses the nature of his legal action against the SEC as an “appeal,” but characterizes it as seeking declaratory, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief against the SEC; and further seeking an Order of Mandamus directing the vacatur and stay of proceedings, decisions, and orders. Further, Altman’s Complaint asserts that the SEC’s proceedings, decisions, and orders against him constituted the first instance in which the SEC has disciplined a lawyer solely for allegations of New York State’s disciplinary rules without a prior hearing, determination or even charges brought against that lawyer by or under the New York State disciplinary procedures. In explaining the extent of damage he has sustained as a result of the SEC’s action, Altman’s Complaint states that: Plaintiff’s reputation as a lawyer is his stock and trade. That reputation has been intentionally and permanently marred by the Commission’s unconstitutional actions against him. Click here to read full-text copies of Altman’s Complaint and Memoradum of Law.

Article: At Denver there was an crowd of passengers into the coaches on the eastbound B. & M. express. In one coach there sat a very pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveler. Among the newcomers were two young men, one of handsome presence with a bold, frank face expression and manner; the other a ruffled, glum-faced person, heavily built and roughly dressed. The two were handcuffed together. As they passed down the aisle of the coach the only available seat offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman. Here the linked couple seated themselves. The young woman's glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile brightening her face and a tender pink tingeing(,) her rounded cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard. \\"Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must. Don't you ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the West?\\" The younger man aroused himself sharply at the sound of her voice, seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly, and then clasped her fingers with his left hand. \\"It's Miss Fairchild,\\" he said, with a smile. \\"I'll ask you to excuse the other hand; \\"it's otherwise engaged just at present.\\" He slightly raised his right hand, bound at the wrist by the shining \\"bracelet\\" to the left one of his companion. The glad look in the girl's eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror. The glow faded from her cheeks. Her lips parted in a vague(,), relaxing distress. Easton, with a little laugh, as if amused, was about to speak again when the other forestalled him. The glum-faced man had been watching the girl's face expression with veiled glances from his keen, shrewd eyes. \\"You'll excuse me for speaking, miss, but, I see you're acquainted with(,) the officer here.

In general, humor and laughter are commonly considered aspects of positive experiences, indicating that the person who wrote the review likely enjoyed the film. Humor is an essential element in many films, whether they are comedies, dramedies, or even action films with witty moments. A film deemed 'particularly funny' hints at a well-executed plot and dialogues that engage the audience, evoke emotions, and make them laugh. This implies a distinct appreciation for the film's writing, actors' performances, and the overall storytelling. In contrast, if the movie had been seen negatively, the reviewer might have employed phrases such as \\"failed attempts at humor,\\" \\"lackluster jokes,\\" or \\"unfunny situations.\\" These terms denote frustration or disappointment with the movie's humor aspect, implying that the film did not adequately provide entertainment.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which P.D. took a more efficient approach in fighting crime? Hint: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant. Answer:","output":"Given the information provided, it is difficult to definitively determine which police department (P.D.) implemented a more efficient approach to fighting crime. Both Greenville and Grayville P.D. took different approaches, and each approach has its own advantages and drawbacks. Greenville P.D. did not invest in advanced technology such as DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. This may have allowed them to allocate more resources towards traditional law enforcement methods, like increased patrolling and forming strong community ties. Not using advanced technological resources can lead to cost savings which can be used in other areas of crime-fighting. Moreover, as the hint suggests, law enforcement officers may be unfamiliar with information technology, so their skills and interest in pursuing attackers may be limited. Thus, Greenville P.D.'s approach might be more suitable given their personnel's expertise and limited resources. On the other hand, Grayville P.D. took extensive measures to invest in advanced technologies such as DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. While these technologies can be costly and may take away valuable resources from other forms of law enforcement, they offer significant benefits in solving complex cases and enabling quicker identification and apprehension of criminals. By investing in advanced technology, law enforcement can exploit new and innovative methods for apprehending criminals and solving a wide range of crimes, from property theft to more serious offenses such as murder or sexual assault. It is important to consider that the efficiency of a crime-fighting approach is not solely determined by the use of technology. Factors such as community engagement, cooperation with international law enforcement agencies, and the expertise and training of police officers may also contribute to a police department's effectiveness in addressing crime. In conclusion, it is difficult to determine which P.D. took a more efficient approach in fighting crime, as both Greenville and Grayville's approaches have their respective advantages and disadvantages. Both departments face challenges, such as budgetary constraints and a rapidly changing technological landscape, which may impact the overall effectiveness of their strategies. Ultimately, the most efficient approach may involve finding a balance between leveraging advanced technology in crime-fighting while also maintaining the focus on traditional law enforcement methods and tactics."},{"instruction":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: flowers blooming where the time seems to stop .","output":"1.

Step by step answer:","output":"Based on the given premise and hypothesis, we will analyze if the hypothesis can be entailed by the premise. Here is a step-by-step explanation: 1. Premise: \\"Soccer players in blue before a game.\\" This premise provides us with the information that there are soccer players who are wearing blue uniforms, and this happens before a game. This implies that the soccer players are already present on the field prior to the commencement of a match. 2. Hypothesis: \\"The players are waiting for the beginning of the game.\\" The hypothesis states that the players are waiting for the game to start. This is a reasonable assumption since the players are present on the field before the game begins. 3. Assessing the entailment between the premise and the hypothesis: To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to evaluate if the premise provides enough information for us to infer that the players are waiting for the beginning of the game. 4. Conclusion: While the premise suggests that soccer players are present in their blue uniforms before the game, it does not explicitly mention whether they are waiting for the game to start or engaging in some other pre-game activities such as warm-ups or team discussions. The hypothesis is a plausible interpretation of the given premise, but it may not be completely entailed by the premise.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Why did Donald Trump ask his supporters to not pay attention to Democrats? - Because he wanted to win, with no other reason - Because Democrats were insulting Trump - not enough information - Because opinion polls said they had an edge The answer to this question is:","output":"Because opinion polls said they had an edge"},{"instruction":"Sherlock Holmes is a 1916 American silent film starring William Gillette as Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.

After all meeting strangers means facing the unknown. And it's human nature to feel a bit uncomfortable about unknown. Most of our fears about dealing with new people comes from doubts about ourselves. We imagine other people are judging us, finding us too tall or too short, too this or too that. But don't forget that they must be feeling the same way. Try to accept yourself as you are, and try to put the other person at ease. You'll both feel more comfortable. Try to act self-confident even if you don't feel that way. When you enter a room full of strangers, such as a new classroom, walk tall and straight, look directly at other people and smile.

Second question: What is it like to have deep psychosis? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choose your answer from: 1). no; 2). yes;","output":"First, I will answer each question and then determine if they are asking the same thing. First question: Are stigmata the sign of deep spirituality or advanced psychosis, or simply self-harm? To answer this question, I will consider the various viewpoints and interpretations of stigmata: 1. Deep spirituality: Some people, particularly within the Catholic tradition, view stigmata as a sign of deep spirituality, as it is believed to be the spontaneous appearance of wounds on the body that resemble those of Jesus Christ during his crucifixion. 2. Advanced psychosis: From a psychiatric perspective, stigmata could potentially be interpreted as manifestations of advanced psychosis, as the individual might be experiencing vivid hallucinations or delusions related to religious themes. 3. Self-harm: In some cases, it's possible that individuals might inflict the wounds upon themselves, either consciously or unconsciously, as a form of self-harm or attention-seeking behavior. In conclusion, stigmata may be seen as a sign of deep spirituality, advanced psychosis, or self-harm, depending on the perspective and circumstances surrounding each particular case. Second question: What is it like to have deep psychosis? Deep psychosis generally refers to a severe mental disorder in which a person loses touch with reality, experiencing delusions, hallucinations, or disordered thinking. The experience of deep psychosis can be quite distressing, as the individual may perceive things that aren't real or believe things that are false or irrational. Each person's experience might differ depending on the specific symptoms and their intensity. Are these two questions asking the same thing?

Near: The word \\"near\\" indicates proximity, suggesting that the scene takes place close to another important element - in this case, a lake. This word is crucial for understanding the relationship between the two landscapes (mountains and lake) and their position relative to each other. 5. Lake: This keyword introduces a significant water body present in the scene. A lake is usually associated with tranquility, reflection, and a variety of aquatic life. \\"Lake\\" suggests that the body of water is a key aspect of the landscape, and it may also imply that it plays a role in the activities, flora, and fauna of the area. In summary, the keywords \\"morning,\\" \\"sky,\\" \\"mountains,\\" \\"near,\\" and \\"lake\\" help paint a picture of the scene in the sentence, describing the time of day, landscape, and geographic features involved."},{"instruction":"Choose the next sentence for this paragraph.

Given the context: What will James want to do next? The answer is:","output":"Given the context, James may want to: 1. Reflect: Take some time to think about his interactions with Taylor to identify if there were any red flags, perceived misunderstandings, or potential areas where he could have inadvertently offended Taylor. This will help him understand if there was any specific reason behind Taylor's sudden silence. 2. Reach out: James could choose to reach out to Taylor to seek clarification or get an understanding of why Taylor stopped talking to him. He might opt to send a message, email or simply give Taylor a call, making sure to express his feelings and inquire gently about Taylor's intentions or reasoning for their silence. 3. Give space: It's possible that Taylor is going through personal issues or needs time apart for any number of reasons. Giving Taylor space could allow them to sort out their feelings and thoughts before deciding if they want to continue communicating with James. 4. Seek advice: James may want to get the opinion of close friends or family members to gain perspective on the situation. They could offer insight or advice that James had not considered before. 5. Self-care: Regardless of the outcome, feeling rejected or unsure about a developing relationship can be emotionally challenging. James should take care of his mental and emotional well-being, potentially engaging in activities that make him happy and focusing on his own personal growth. 6. Be prepared to move on: Ultimately, James needs to understand that not every dating interaction will lead to a successful, long-term relationship. If Taylor does not respond to his inquiries or decides not to continue dating, James should be prepared to accept that outcome and move on, recognizing that there are other potential partners out there who may be better suited for him."},{"instruction":"Allgemein gesehen ist die Überarbeitung des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspaktes keine schlechte Sache, denn wie die Erfahrungen in meinem Land gezeigt haben, hemmen übermäßig strenge Vorschriften das Wachstum und üben einen gewissen deflationären Druck aus.

Heimskringla, Fagrskinna and Morkinskinna all describe the period up to the year 1177, although the parts of Morkinskinna that are preserved only extend to 1157. These three sagas were written c. 1220-1230, and in using them as historical sources, it has to be remembered that they were thus written a fair amount of time after the events they describe. However, they are likely to have been based on earlier works, in particular the saga Hryggjarstykki, written c. 1150, which is lost to us, but was available to the authors of the three aforementioned sagas.

Back home, after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital went well, but his conducting in the afternoon was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\". Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs.

He was less successful in extending control into Wales. William is commonly known as William Rufus (Rufus being Latin for 'the Red'), perhaps because of his red-faced appearance or, more likely, due to having red hair as a child that grew out in later life. Context: William Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement detailed in the Domesday Book, a survey undertaken at his father's command, essentially for the purposes of taxation, which was an example of the control of the English monarchy. If he was less effective than his father in containing the Norman lords' propensity for rebellion and violence, through charisma, or political skills, he was forceful in overcoming the consequences. In 1095, Robert de Mowbray, the earl of Northumbria, refused to attend the Curia Regis, the thrice-annual court where the King announced his governmental decisions to the great lords. William led an army against Robert and defeated him. Robert was dispossessed and imprisoned, and another noble, William of Eu, accused of treachery, was blinded and castrated. In external affairs, William had some successes. In 1091 he repulsed an invasion by King Malcolm III of Scotland, forcing Malcolm to pay homage. In 1092 he built Carlisle Castle, taking control of Cumberland and Westmorland, which had previously been claimed by the Scots. Subsequently, the two kings quarrelled over Malcolm's possessions in England, and Malcolm again invaded, ravaging Northumbria. At the Battle of Alnwick, on 13 November 1093, Malcolm was ambushed by Norman forces led by Robert de Mowbray. Malcolm and his son Edward were killed and Malcolm III's brother Donald seized the throne. William supported Malcolm's son Duncan II, who held power for a short time, and then another of Malcolm's sons, Edgar. Edgar conquered Lothian in 1094 and eventually removed Donald in 1097 with William's aid in a campaign led by Edgar AEtheling. Edgar recognised William's authority over Lothian and attended William's court. William made two forays into Wales in 1097. Nothing decisive was achieved, but a series of castles was constructed as a marchland defensive barrier. In 1096, William's brother Robert Curthose joined the First Crusade. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his Duchy of Normandy to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks--a sum equalling about a quarter of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of English taxation, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. William then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence. Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William's death. As regent for his brother Robert in Normandy, William campaigned in France from 1097 to 1099. He secured northern Maine but failed to seize the French-controlled part of the Vexin region. According to William of Malmesbury he was planning to invade Aquitaine at the time of his death. Question: how long did it last for. Whats the answer?","output":"The question seems to be asking about the duration of a particular event or period in William II's life, but it is not specific as to which event or period it is referring to. Here are a few durations related to events mentioned in the context: 1. Reign as King of England: William II, also known as William Rufus, reigned as King of England from 1087 until his death in 1100, which is approximately 13 years. 2. Robert Curthose's participation in the First Crusade: William's brother, Robert Curthose, joined the First Crusade in 1096. He did not return to Normandy until September 1100, which means his participation in the Crusade lasted around 4 years. 3. William's regency in Normandy: As a regent for his brother in Normandy, William campaigned in France between 1097 and 1099, a period of about 2 years. If you could provide more specific details about the event or period you are referring to, I would be glad to give you a more accurate answer regarding its duration."},{"instruction":"Why Quora has word limit for question and question descriptions? Why is there a sign limit on Quora for questions? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Options are: I. no. II. yes.","output":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. Quora, a popular question and answer platform, has implemented a word limit for questions and question descriptions for several reasons. The following factors contribute to the rationale behind Quora's decision to enforce these restrictions: 1. Clarity: Concise questions tend to be clearer and easier to understand. By imposing a word limit, Quora encourages users to focus on the essential components of their queries, ensuring that the questions posed are easy to read and comprehend. In turn, this facilitates more accurate responses from individuals who possess relevant knowledge or expertise in the subject matter. 2. User Experience: Restricting the length of questions and descriptions on Quora significantly improves the platform's user experience. By presenting brief, succinct questions, users can quickly scan and identify the topics that interest them or those to which they can contribute valuable insights. This increases user engagement, participation, and satisfaction on the platform. 3. Maintain Focused Conversations: Another critical aspect of implementing a word limit on Quora is the ability to maintain focused conversations around specific topics. By encouraging users to keep their questions concise and to the point, the platform minimizes the likelihood of numerous branching or unrelated discussions, which can often lead to confusion and dilute the value of the information exchange. As a result, Quora can better fulfill its role as an efficient knowledge-sharing platform. 4. Demands on Attention: In today's fast-paced and information-saturated world, people often have limited attention spans. Long and verbose questions have the potential to lose a reader's interest, leading them to bypass the question or miss essential details. By setting a word limit on questions and descriptions, Quora ensures that its platform remains engaging and accessible to a diverse user base. 5. Quality Control: A word limit encourages users to prioritize the quality of their questions over quantity. It discourages the use of excessive information or irrelevant details that could potentially derail a discussion or dilute the question's primary focus. This emphasis on quality helps ensure that Quora remains an effective platform for knowledge exchange. In summary, the word limit for questions and question descriptions on Quora contributes significantly to the platform's functionality and user experience. Through these restrictions, Quora promotes concise, clear, and relevant questions that foster targeted and meaningful conversations among members of its community."},{"instruction":"Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Fright Night Part II begins after the hellish events in the original Fright Night.

Today, we are going to talk about something called a \\"census.\\" A census is when people collect information about everyone living in a country. One of the things they ask is what language everyone speaks. Sometimes, people don't speak English even if they live in a country where most people do. Now, let's try to find out what percent of people in our imaginary country don't speak English. For this, we'll use pretend numbers, okay? Imagine that there are 1,000 people living in this country. After the census, we learn that 800 of them speak English. But that means there are still 200 people who don't speak English. To find the percent of people who don't speak English, we're going to play with numbers. Here's what we do: Step 1: We take the number of people who don't speak English (200) and divide it by the total number of people (1,000). Like this: 200 ÷ 1,000 = 0.2 Step 2: To change 0.2 into a percent, we simply multiply it by 100. Like this: 0.2 x 100 = 20 That's it! We found out that 20% of the people in our imaginary country don't speak English. Isn't it interesting to learn about different languages and cultures? Just remember that every country and every census is different. The real numbers might be very different from our pretend ones. Now you know how to find what percentage of people don't speak a particular language using a census! Keep learning, little friends, and who knows what interesting things you'll discover next!"},{"instruction":"Q:Given the following context: On March 19, 2003, Iraqi General Mohammed Al-Rawi flees his residence amid the bombardment of Baghdad. Before leaving the compound, he passes a notebook to his aide Seyyed, instructing him to warn his officers to get to their safehouses and wait for his signal. Four weeks later, U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller and his platoon check a warehouse for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. To Miller's surprise, the warehouse has not been secured, with looters making their way in and out, as soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division are too few to do much.

Once you've defeated Team Galactic and your party is ready, you can head to Lake Verity and cause Mesprit to appear. Flying to Twinleaf Town is the quickest way to get to the lake. You'll find the Verity Cavern entrance in the middle of the lake. You'll see Mesprit in the center of the room. It will look like the battle is about to start, and then Mesprit will run away before it begins. Professor Rowan will inform you that Mesprit is now roaming throughout Sinnoh, and that you can track it on the map. Roaming Pokémon like Mesprit will change locations every time you move between locations. This can make tracking them down difficult, but there's a trick you can use to speed it up. Walking between these two locations is the most effective way to encounter a roaming Pokémon due to the close proximity of tall grass on each side and the low level wild Pokemon. Each time you walk from one location to the other, Mesprit will move to a new location in Sinnoh. You can see its current location flashing on your Marking Map in the lower screen. Mesprit's movements are random, so you may have to go back and forth many times until you're both in the same spot. Once you've changed locations and Mesprit is in the same location you are, use a Repel so that you don't encounter any other Pokemon. If you encounter another Pokémon or start a battle with a trainer, Mesprit will move and you'll have to start over. Save before attempting to encounter Mesprit so you can quickly try again if you accidentally mess up. Since you're using a Repel, you won't encounter any Pokémon lower than your first Pokemon's level. This will prevent you from encountering any of the wild Pokémon in these two areas. If your first Pokémon is over level 50, the Repel will prevent you from encountering Mesprit. Summary:","output":"After defeating Team Galactic and preparing your party, head to Lake Verity to encounter Mesprit, who becomes a roaming Pokémon through Sinnoh, making it challenging to catch; use the Marking Map to track its location, walk between areas with tall grass, utilize Repel to avoid other encounters, and save beforehand for a successful attempt."},{"instruction":"Solve 0 = 189*i + 268*i - 2464 + 2440 + 9621 for i..

The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher...

Strangely, though, most people seem unprepared for disappointment and react to it in negative ways. They feel depressed or try to escape from their troubles instead of using disappointment as an opportunity for growth. One negative reaction to disappointment is depression. A woman trying to win a promotion, for example, works hard for over a year in her department. Helen is so sure she will get the promotion. However, the boss names one of Helen's co-workers for the spot. Deeply depressed, Helen loses her enthusiasm for her job and can barely force herself to show up every day. Helen tells herself that she is a failure and that doing a good job just isn't worth the work. Another negative reaction to disappointment is the desire to escape. Kevin fails to get into the college his brother is attending, the college that was the focus of all his dreams, and decides to escape his disappointment. Why worry about college at all? Instead, he covers up his real feelings by giving up on his school-work and getting completely involved with friends, parties, and \\"good times\\". The positive way to react to disappointment is to use it as a chance for growth. This isn't easy, but it's the only useful way to deal with an inevitable part of life. Helen, the woman who was not promoted, could have handled her disappointment by looking at other options. If her boss did not recognize her talent and hard work, perhaps she could transfer to another department. Or she could ask the boss how to improve her performance so that she could prepare for the next promotion. Kevin, the boy who didn't get into the college of his choice, should look into other schools. Going to another college may encourage him to be his own person, step out of his brother's shadow, and realize that being turned down by one college isn't a final judgment on his abilities or potential.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has... After the story ends, Comey probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - returns to the FBI after a few months - not enough information - Does not return to working for the FBI ever - works for a restaurant chain Answer:","output":"Does not return to working for the FBI ever After being fired by President Trump, James Comey has not returned to working for the FBI and it is highly unlikely that he will in the future. Instead, Comey has focused on writing his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" and engaging in the publicity tour related to its release. The book touches on Comey's contentious relationship with President Trump and his challenges with maintaining the independence of the FBI. In the book, Comey criticizes Trump's leadership style and questions his ethical standing. The memoir also illustrates several personal incidents between Comey and Trump, shedding light on Trump's alleged attempts to influence the investigation into Russian election interference. Comey's firing by Trump led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. This probe has since expanded to include potential obstruction of justice by President Trump – a claim that he denies. Given the public nature of the disputes between Comey and Trump, and Comey's foray into authoring a memoir that critiques the president, it is highly improbable that he would ever return to working for the FBI. Instead, Comey will likely continue his career in other sectors, engaging with the public through media appearances, speaking engagements, and potentially writing additional books."},{"instruction":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: Three men are riding a spotted elephant in the middle of the park.","output":"The most important words in the sentence are: 1. \\"men\\" - This tells us who is doing the action. 2. \\"riding\\" - This tells us what the men are doing. 3. \\"spotted elephant\\" - This tells us what the men are riding on. 4. \\"park\\" - This tells us where everything is happening.

Almost two centuries before Columbus, Ibn Battuta set off for Mecca, returning home three decades later as one of history's great travelers. Driven by curiosity, he journeyed to remote comers of the Islamic world, traveling through 44 modern countries, three times as far as Marco Polo. Little celebrated in the West, his name is well known among Arabs. In his hometown of Tangier, a square, a hotel, a cafe, a ferry boat, and even a hamburger are named after him. Ibn Battuta stayed in Mecca as a student for several years, but the urge to travel soon took over. In one adventure, he traveled to India seeking profitable employment with the sultan of Delhi.On the way, he described his group being attacked in the open country by 80 men on foot, and two horsemen. \\"We fought... killing one of their horsemen and about twelve of the foot soldiers... I was hit by an arrow and my horse by another, but God in his grace preserved me... \\". In Delhi, the sultan gave him the position of judge, based on his _ study at Mecca. But the sultan had an unpredictable character, and Ibn Battuta looked for an opportunity to leave. When the sultan offered to finance a trip to China, he agreed. IbnBattuta set off in three ships, but misfortune struck while he was still on the shore. A sudden storm grounded and broke up two ships, scattering treasure and drowning many people and horses. As he watched, the third ship with all his belongings and slaves (one carrying his child), was carried out to sea and never heard from again. After a lifetime of incredible adventures, Ibn Battuta was finally ordered by the sultan of Morocco to return home to share his wisdom with the world.

Beneath the layers of beige and gray are jagged markings that dominate San Bernardino Police Sgt. Dwight Waldo's world. He has tracked them for two decades — chasing taggers through back alleys, recovering hundreds of weapons from their hangouts and memorizing, then forgetting, more than 5,000 tags. What many in law enforcement once viewed as petty vandalism, mostly the work of teens with spray cans, early on became something more to Waldo. The graffiti on those walls promoted gangs, fostered serious crime and poisoned residents' sense of well-being. In his quest for understanding, Waldo — who, friends say, doesn't swear, drink or walk against traffic lights — became a nationally recognized expert on the swaggering urban culture of wall-writing. He wrote the manual, self-publishing \\"Taggers and the Graffiti Culture,\\" a how-to for law enforcement. \\"He's been kind of the godfather of it all,\\" said Sgt. Chris Meadows of the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department's anti-graffiti squad. Now 54, Waldo said he plans to retire this year, although he knows he will never be completely free of his life's work. After years of chasing taggers across San Bernardino, he knows a thousand names from the walls. But he will never say them aloud. \\"It's what they want: fame and recognition,\\" Waldo said. He won't give it to them. Waldo grew up in the village of Bath, N.Y. , about 100 miles southeast of Buffalo. After a stint in the military that brought him to Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, he joined the Police Department in 1984 and seven years later was attached to its gang unit. One of his first assignments was to investigate some scrawls that had gone up on walls near a high school. After the arrest of five young suspects was reported in a local newspaper, dozens of people called to thank the police for their work. Not long after that, Waldo said, a 12-year-old boy was killed in his own frontyard by a bullet meant for his brother. Authorities determined that the older youth had been targeted by a gang for dropping out of its tagging crew. Those incidents crystallized for Waldo the pernicious effects of graffiti on the community. He threw himself into investigating taggers, spending hours at night poring over photos of their unique signatures. He concluded that graffiti fell into five distinct categories, reflecting a desire to communicate beliefs, express hatred, mark territory, seek personal fame or display artistic talent. He cataloged hundreds of names and monikers in a bulging three-ring binder. That got unwieldy, so in 1992 he bought a computer and entered all the information on a spreadsheet. He devised a way to help decipher the more mystifying tags: One officer would attempt to \\"read\\" the graffiti out loud as another, listening with eyes shut, would verbalize whatever came to mind. \\"When the mind is not engaged in observing letters and is only hearing … sounds, it becomes clear what the actual name is,\\" Waldo explained. He is intense by nature: When he decided to take up music a few years ago, he learned how to play the violin, piano, pedal-steel guitar, mandolin, dulcimer, acoustic guitar and bagpipes. Similarly, chasing taggers became an obsession. The more he learned, he said, the more he seemed to be fighting a losing battle.","output":"San Bernardino Police Sgt.

Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies.Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friends Johnny (Luis Gusman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Timmy (I think that was his name, he never shows up in the film) was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of softball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Hector (Alexander Bautista), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Hector, and Hector stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Hector, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back the they make their way to Edy's store.Upon arrival at Edy's store, Jesse gets a warm welcome from the staff and neighbours being something of a war hero to those around him.

Sentence 2: The four largest ethnic groups reported in the town are 29 % Irish , 16 % German , 11 % English and 7 % Italian . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"Step 1: Read both sentences carefully to understand the information that they convey. Sentence 1: The four largest ethnicities reported in the town are 29% Irish, 16% German, 11% English, and 7% Italian. Sentence 2: The four largest ethnic groups reported in the town are 29% Irish, 16% German, 11% English, and 7% Italian. Step 2: Analyze the structure and the words used in the sentences. Both sentences have the same structure and follow the same pattern: \\"The four largest ____ reported in the town are 29% Irish, 16% German, 11% English, and 7% Italian.\\" The only different words in the sentences are \\"ethnicities\\" in the first sentence and \\"ethnic groups\\" in the second. Step 3: Understand the meaning of the different words. The term \\"ethnicities\\" refers to categories or groups of people who identify with each other on the basis of shared attributes like nationality, culture, language, or history. The term \\"ethnic groups\\" also refers to categories of people who identify with each other due to shared attributes such as culture, language, or history. Step 4: Compare the meanings of the words in the context of the sentences. In the context of these sentences, both \\"ethnicities\\" and \\"ethnic groups\\" are used to categorize people based on their cultural, historical, or national characteristics. The exact percentages of the four groups (Irish, German, English, and Italian) reported in the town are exactly the same in both sentences. Hence, considering the context, the understanding of both sentences would be roughly the same.

She began her acting career in 2001, with several minor television and film roles, and played a regular role on the Hope & Faith television sitcom. In 2004, she made her film debut with a role in the teen comedy Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. In 2007, she co-starred as Mikaela Banes, the love interest of Shia LaBeouf's character, in the blockbuster action film Transformers, which became her breakout role. Fox was born on May 16, 1986 in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Her parents are Gloria Darlene (Cisson) and Franklin Thomas Fox. Fox's father, a parole officer, and her mother divorced when Fox was three years old. Her mother later remarried, and Fox and her sister were raised by her mother and her stepfather, Tony Tonachio. She was raised \\"very strictly Pentecostal\\", but later attended Catholic school for 12 years. Fox's parents divorced when she was young. She said that the two were \\"very strict\\" and that she was not allowed to have a boyfriend or invite friends to her house. She lived with her mother until she made enough money to support herself. Fox began her training in dance and drama at age five, in Kingston, Tennessee. She attended a dance class at the community center there and was involved in Kingston Elementary School's chorus and the Kingston Clippers swim team. At 10 years of age, after moving to St. Petersburg, Florida, Fox continued her training. When she was 13 years old, Fox began modeling after winning several awards at the 1999 American Modeling and Talent Convention in Hilton Head, South Carolina. At age 17, she tested out of school via correspondence in order to move to Los Angeles, California. Fox has spoken extensively of her time in education; that in middle school she was bullied; consequently she ate lunch in the bathroom to avoid being \\"pelted with ketchup packets\\". She said that the problem was not her looks, but that she had \\"always gotten along better with boys\\" and that \\"rubbed some people the wrong way\\". Fox also said of high school that she was never popular and that \\"everyone hated me, and I was a total outcast, my friends were always guys, I have a very aggressive personality, and girls didn't like me for that. I've had only one great girlfriend my whole life\\". In the same interview, she mentions that she hated school and has \\"never been a big believer in formal education\\" and that \\"the education I was getting seemed irrelevant.

With the highly-anticipated showdown less than two weeks away, candidates with low polling numbers are in a high-stakes scramble to qualify for an event that represents their best shot at breaking out. Fox News is capping the Aug. 6 debate in Cleveland at 10 candidates based on five as-of-yet unspecified national polls released by 5 p.m. on Aug. 4. ADVERTISEMENT Based on five polls used by RealClearPolitics (RCP), eight candidates look like locks to make the stage, while the race for the final two slots is headed for a controversial photo finish. For the candidates currently ranked between ninth place and 14th place, the polling differential is negligible. “It’s a roll of the dice,” said Monmouth University polling director Patrick Murray. “It’s going to come down to the vagaries of how independent pollsters round off their results — we’re talking tenths of decimal points. It could come down to the five or six people who didn’t pick up their phones for a national survey and the five or six people who did.” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry James (Rick) Richard PerryTexas New Members 2019 Senate should reject Trump’s radical nominee to key energy panel Perry: We shouldn't let Russia use energy as a weapon MORE, businesswoman Carly Fiorina, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal are separated by only 1.5 percentage points, according to the RCP national average at the end of last week. Christie looks to be in the best shape of the bunch, sitting in 9th place with 2.8 percent support. Perry and Kasich are tied for 10th with 1.8 percent support, followed by Fiorina and Santorum at 1.4 percent, and Jindal at 1.2. (By contrast, the lowest of the top eight, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), has 5.4 percent support; the highest, Donald Trump, has 18.2 percent.) Getting left out of the first debate would be a significant blow to all of their prospects. “It’s extremely important to be out there,” said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. “If you’re not there, it’s out-of-sight-out-of-mind for voters, and just as importantly right now, for your fundraising efforts.” For Christie and Santorum, missing the debate would put a spotlight on how far their stars have fallen. Christie was once flying high in the polls. As early as last year he was considered by many a favorite to win the nomination. And Santorum is the most recent winner of the Iowa caucuses, having emerged in 2012 as the primary challenger to eventual nominee Mitt Romney. Meanwhile, Kasich risks being frozen out of a debate that will take place in a state where he’s the sitting governor. For Perry, it would mean a missed opportunity for redemption after a mortifying brain-freeze on the debate stage essentially ended his presidential run in 2012. A spot on the debate stage could legitimize Fiorina’s outsider bid while allowing her to showcase her much-lauded skills as a communicator. And some Republicans believe Jindal’s firebrand conservatism could catch on in Iowa, if only he could get the exposure. It’s setting up as a dogfight among the campaigns to boost their standing nationally ahead of the debates. It means weighing the return on investment of spending early in an attempt to make the debate, versus mapping out a longer-term strategy. “We’ve never seen anything like this,” said GOP strategist David Payne. “These candidates who are not polling well are forced to spend early money for national ad buys, while the earned media pathway is complicated by Donald Trump, who is costing every other candidate a chance to get in front of the camera. It’s a challenge.” The campaign strategies for how the candidates plan to address that challenge are coming into view. Christie’s campaign is betting big that a national advertising push can shore up his standing. This week, the campaign put 250,000 behind ads that will run on Fox News. The New Jersey governor is also getting an assist from a supporting super-PAC, which last week put more than 1 million into ads that will run in the Northeast. Perry is hitching his train to Donald Trump. He has emerged as the most vocal opponent of the businessman and reality TV star, who is riding a media frenzy to the top of the polls. Perry could get a lift from Trump’s media coattails. In addition, the former Texas governor is getting help from the well-funded super-PACs backing his bid. The Opportunity and Freedom PAC has booked nearly 1 million in national ads on conservative TV and radio outlets ahead of the debate. Austin Barbour, who runs the PAC, noted that Perry tied for seventh in last week’s ABC News-Washington Post poll. “My hope is that we’ll see a couple more polls like that because of this earned media he’s getting off Trump, the speeches he’s giving and what we’ve been doing with paid media.” Meanwhile, Santorum said at an event in Washington earlier this month that he’d ramp up his media appearances before the debate, and he’s following through. On Wednesday, Santorum did two Fox News hits, appeared on CNN and a Bloomberg online show and finished the day sparring with liberal host Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. Kasich’s political team says their strategy is to focus on New Hampshire rather than on resources meant to raise his profile nationally. But the Ohio governor’s political team spent significantly on TV ads ahead of his launch and will hope his late entrance into the race is perfectly timed to give him a polling boost heading into August. Predictably, the complaining over Fox News’s debate standards has picked up in recent days. Sen.

And if we do fear debates, what business do we have trying to win elections,” wrote Curt Anderson. “The plan to limit the participants in these debates is ridiculous in almost every respect.” The Louisiana governor has temporarily suspended his campaign to deal with a shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette. Fox News is holding a one-hour forum for the candidates who don’t qualify for the main event earlier in the day. “That secondary forum will have a lot of qualified, highly knowledgeable and articulate folks,” said Dave Catalfamo, a spokesperson for former New York Gov. George Pataki, who also barely registers in the polls. “It might end up being more substantive because the candidates won’t have to respond to whatever idiotic thing Donald Trump says.” But most Republicans view it as a second-tier gathering nonetheless. “If you’re not in that top 10, you’re not going to be taken as seriously,” said Bonjean. “You risk getting left behind.\\" ||||| Fox News is opening its 5 p.m. debate to all the announced Republican candidates who fail to make the cut for the Aug. 6 prime-time event, removing a requirement that participants reach at least 1 percent in polling. The change amounts to an insurance policy for candidates who were in danger of being disqualified from the vital first debate based on low polls – Carly Fiorina, former New York Gov. George Pataki and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Story Continued Below The announcement by Michael Clemente, Fox News Executive Vice President, News, means that all 16 announced candidates will qualify for Cleveland — either the 5 p.m. undercard, or the 9 p.m. main event. The 9 p.m. debate will include the 10 candidates with the highest average in national polls, as determined by Fox News. The 5 p.m. forum will now include all the rest. According to a POLITICO analysis of the latest national polling, the prime-time participants today would be Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Rick Perry. The next three, who would currently be relegated to 5 p.m., are Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Rick Santorum and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. They are followed by Fiorina, Pataki and Graham. All of the candidates have been getting extensive Fox airtime. Here’s a tally of the total combined Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network appearances — several for an hour — by each of the hopefuls since their official campaign launches: 1) Paul, 35 … 2) Huckabee, 31 … 3) Trump, 30 … 4) Perry, 24 … 5-6) Fiorina and Jindal, 20 each … 7) Cruz, 17 … 8) Santorum, 16 … 9) Rubio, 14 … 10-11) Carson and Graham, 12 each … 12-13) Kasich and Pataki, 11 each … 14) Christie, 7 … 15) Walker, 4 … 16) Bush, 3. “Due to the overwhelming interest in the FOX News Facebook Debate Event Night on August 6th and in a concerted effort to include and accommodate the now 16 Republican candidate field — the largest in modern political history — FOX News is expanding participation in the 5 PM/ET debate to all declared candidates whose names are consistently being offered to respondents in major national polls, as recognized by Fox News,” said Clemente in a statement. “Although we are relaxing one component of our entry criteria – the requirement that candidates must score 1% or higher in an average of five most recent national polls – all other components of the criteria remain in effect for the 5 PM/ET debate. Participants must meet all U.S. Constitutional requirements; must announce and register a formal campaign for president; and must file all necessary paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), including financial disclosure. “As for the 9 PM/ET debate, all components of the original criteria remain unchanged – including the requirement that participants must place in the top 10 of an average of the five most recent national polls, as recognized by FOX News, leading up to August 4th at 5PM/ET. Such polling must be conducted by major, nationally recognized organizations that use standard methodological techniques. “Everyone included in these debates has a chance to be President of the United States and we look forward to showcasing all of the candidates in the first primary event of the 2016 election season.” The 5 p.m. debate, which will last an hour, will be moderated by Bill Hemmer and Martha MacCallum. The 9 p.m. debate will run about 90 minutes (two hours with commercial breaks and introductions), and be moderated by Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace.

Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music initially became popular in Chicago clubs in 1984, pioneered by figures such as Frankie Knuckles, Phuture, Kym Mazelle, and Mr. Fingers, and was associated with African-American and gay subcultures. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, Baltimore, and Newark all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Killing Joke are an English rock band formed in October 1978 in Notting Hill, London, England. The original line-up included Jaz Coleman (vocals, keyboards), \\"Big\\" Paul Ferguson (drums), Geordie Walker (guitars) and Martin \\"Youth\\" Glover (bass). - Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno, RDI (born 15 May 1948 and originally christened Brian Peter George Eno) is an English musician, composer, record producer, singer, writer, and visual artist. He is best known for his pioneering work in ambient and electronic music as well as his contributions to rock, worldbeat, chance, and generative music styles. A self-described \\"non-musician\\", Eno has advocated a methodology of \\"theory over practice\\" throughout his career, and has helped to introduce a variety of unique recording techniques and conceptual approaches into contemporary music. He has been described as one of popular music's most influential and innovative figures. - Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term \\"graphic design\\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common uses of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging and signage. - Alex Paterson (also known as Dr Alex Paterson, born Duncan Alexander Robert Paterson on 15 October 1959 near Battersea in London) is an English musician and co-founder of ambient house group The Orb, in which he has worked since its inception. - A brand (or marque for car model) is a name, term, design, symbol, or other feature that distinguishes one sellers product from those of others.

He is an on and off member of such groups as Sun Electric and The Orb. - An anti-establishment view or belief is one which stands in opposition to the conventional social, political, and economic principles of a society. The term was first used in the modern sense in 1958, by the British magazine \\"New Statesman\\" to refer to its political and social agenda. - James \\"Jimmy\\" Francis Cauty (born 19 December 1956), also known as Rockman Rock, is an English artist and musician, best known as one half of the duo The KLF, co-founder of The Orb and as the man who burnt one million pounds. - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - Consumerism is a social and economic order and ideology that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts. Early criticism of consumerism was in the works of Thorstein Veblen in 1899, which examined the middle class emerging at the turn of the 20th century, which came to fruition by the end of the 20th century through the process of globalization. - Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments and electronic music technology in its production, an electronic musician being a musician who composes and/or performs such music. In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer. - Ambient music is a genre of music that puts an emphasis on tone and atmosphere over traditional musical structure or rhythm. Ambient music is said to evoke an \\"atmospheric\\", \\"visual\\", or \\"unobtrusive\\" quality. According to Brian Eno, one of its pioneers, \\"Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.\\" - The Designers Republic (tDR for short) is a graphic design studio based in Sheffield, England, founded in 1986 by Ian Anderson and Nick Phillips. Best known for electronic music logos and album artwork and their anti-establishment aesthetics, embracing \\"brash consumerism and the uniform style of corporate brands\\". Work by tDR is held in the permanent collections of MoMA and the V&A. - The Orb are an English electronic music group known for being the pioneers of ambient house. Founded in 1988 by Alex Paterson and The KLF member Jimmy Cauty, the Orb began as ambient and dub DJs in London. Their early performances were inspired by ambient and electronic artists of the 1970s and 1980s, most notably Brian Eno and Kraftwerk. Because of their trippy sound, the Orb developed a cult following among clubbers \\"coming down\\" from drug-induced highs. The Orb has maintained their drug-related and science fiction themes despite personnel changes, including the departure of Cauty and other Orb members Kris Weston, Andy Falconer, Simon Phillips, Nick Burton and Andy Hughes. Paterson has been the only permanent member, continuing to work as the Orb with the Swiss-German producer Thomas Fehlmann and, later, with Martin \\"Youth\\" Glover, bass player with Killing Joke. - Ambient house is a subgenre of house music that first emerged in the late 1980s, combining elements of acid house and ambient music. Tracks in the ambient house genre typically feature four-on-the-floor beat patterns, synth pads, and vocal samples integrated in a style classed as \\"atmospheric\\". - Electronic dance music (also known as EDM, dance music, club music, or simply dance) is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. EDM is generally produced for playback by disc jockeys (DJs) who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, by segueing from one recording to another. EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA. In the United Kingdom and in continental Europe, EDM is more commonly called 'dance music' or simply 'dance'. - Kraftwerk (\\"\\"power station\\"\\") is a German electronic music band formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in 1970 in Düsseldorf. In the 1970s, they were among the first successful pop acts to popularize electronic music and are widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of the genre. The band was fronted by both Hütter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008. - Techno is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the mid-to-late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word \\"techno\\" in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built. - Acid house is a subgenre of house music developed around the mid-1980s by DJs from Chicago. The style was defined primarily by the deep basslines and \\"squelching\\" sounds of the Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. Acid house spread to the United Kingdom and continental Europe, where it was played by DJs in the acid house and later rave scenes. By the late 1980s, acid house had moved into the British mainstream, where it had some influence on pop and dance styles. - U.F.Orb is the second studio album by ambient house / techno group The Orb . It was released in July 1992 and reached # 1 on the UK Album Chart . It featured an edited version of The Orb 's single \`\` Blue Room '' .

Noah researched the climate of Antarctica, while Frank researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa. and a hint : Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job.

How much fuel did she use in total for the two weeks? Answer. 27 What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","output":"The given answer seems to be incorrect, as it does not match the step-by-step reasoning. Please find the correct solution below. Step 1: Calculate how much fuel Mary used last week. Mary used 15 gallons of fuel this week. Last week she used 20% less. So we need to find 20% of 15 gallons. 20% of 15 = 20/100 * 15 = 3 gallons This means Mary used 3 gallons less fuel last week than she did this week. Step 2: Subtract the difference from this week's fuel usage. Subtract the difference (3 gallons) from this week's fuel usage (15 gallons) to find last week's fuel usage. Last week's fuel usage = 15 - 3 = 12 gallons Step 3: Add the fuel usage for the two weeks. To find the total fuel used for the two weeks, add this week's fuel usage (15 gallons) and last week's fuel usage (12 gallons). Total fuel usage = 15 + 12 = 27 gallons So, Mary used a total of 27 gallons of fuel for the two weeks."},{"instruction":"I don't understand why making remakes has become the trend. Every remake I have ever seen is awful, and this is no exception. If any of you have seen the quote from Ben Jones, that it is a \\"sleazy\\" piece of trash, he is quite right. Why they would take a wonderful television show, which I loved, have never missed an episode, and own seasons 1-4 on DVD, and ruin it, I'll never know. The television show was a family show, and although Daisy has the body, it was really flaunted, or even addressed in the show, save the outfits. A family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage, and I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it. Another thing I didn't like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they are also extremely cute. The new Bo and Luke are not even a little cute. That was one of the drawers for the show. The casting is terrible. They could have at least gotten a brunette for Daisy. I don't think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg, either. Every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role. The only role they cast halfway decent is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but still it is no comparison. Denver Pyle is an actor all his own, and that made him perfect for the role.

They are related but touch on different aspects of the topic of world government. 1. \\"Should there be a world government?\\": This question is asking for an opinion or an argument regarding the necessity or desirability of a world government. To address this question, one would need to consider the advantages and disadvantages of having a single governing body for the entire world and whether the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Some points to consider may include global cooperation, consistency in policy implementation, and conflict resolution versus issues of sovereignty, cultural diversity, and potential abuse of power. 2. \\"Why isn't there a world government?\\": This question is seeking to understand the reasons behind the absence of a world government in the current geopolitical landscape. In answering this question, one would need to provide historical, political, and cultural context that has prevented the formation of a global governing institution.

Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers.

All concrete is porous and absorbs moisture, but if your concrete patio contains too much moisture, you won’t be able to paint it until you correct the moisture content. Take an 18-inch by 18-inch square of aluminum foil or thick plastic and tape down all four sides, sealing the square to the concrete with tape. Wait 16 to 24 hours. After that time, carefully remove the square of foil or plastic and check the concrete and the underside of the square for condensation or moisture. If the concrete is still damp, wait until weather allows complete drying. Protect the area from sprinklers and garden runoff. Proceed once the concrete is completely dry. Since you are painting concrete in an outdoor area, not just any paint will suffice. Regular exterior paint will likely crack on a concrete surface and peel off shortly after being applied. There are several types of paint that will work for your outdoor concrete patio, and they include: Concrete paints that contain sealants or waterproofing features, so the paint is designed to resist water, salt, oil, and grease. This is a good choice for paint because it's specifically designed for outdoor concrete and resistance to various substances and elements. Latex, water-based, or oil-based exterior paints that are designed for floor, patios, or porches. These paints are also a good choice, as they are designed for exterior use and are specific to withstand foot traffic. Masonry paints that contain added binders and epoxies. While it may bond well with the concrete, it won't necessarily protect your concrete from the elements. Garage floor coatings with colorful additives to protect and decorate at the same time. To help you decide what color to paint your patio, consider what color the exterior of your house is, and what color your patio furniture is. Take color swatches with you to the paint store so you can compare your existing decor with your paint choices. Don't be afraid to ask the paint specialist for help and advice! A concrete or block primer will give you a nice, even surface to work with, instead of the uneven, porous surface of non-primed concrete. It will also reduce the number of coats required to properly cover your surface. Choose an exterior-grade primer if you’re going to use one, and make sure it’s designed for concrete. Concrete primers are often called concrete, masonry, or bonding primers. Once you’ve decided what kind of paint you’re going to use, you will need to do some basic calculations to determine how many cans of paint you’ll need to cover the patio surface. Check the paint can or manufacturer's website regarding how much coverage one can provides, and compare that with the square footage of your patio. Square footage is determined by multiplying the length by the width of the area you are dealing with. Don't worry if your patio isn't perfectly square or rectangular: you just need a basic idea of the area you're going to cover. Don't forget to take into account whether you plan on applying multiple coats. A primer will reduce the likelihood of having to apply more than one or two coats of paint. Before getting started, get together all the tools you’re going to need for painting. The best painting tools for this will be a masonry brush, a high-capacity roller, or a texture roller. The equipment you’ll need may include: Primer (optional) and paint A paint roller frame and cover A paint tray Roller and brush extenders Masking or painter’s tape Thick and thin brushes Plastic or painter's tarps Use tape to line the surfaces touching your concrete patio, such as deck edges, exterior walls, doors or windows, and other areas that you don’t want to accidentally paint. Cover the ground nearby with tarps if necessary. Ideally, begin painting on a dry day when there has been no rain in the previous 24 hours, and none is expected in the long-range forecast. The best temperature for outdoor painting is about 50 F (10 C).","output":"The article provides a comprehensive guide on preparing and painting a concrete patio, emphasizing the importance of ensuring the surface is completely dry before proceeding.

He alleges that Mark Dobson, a HBOS manager who was jailed, helped destroy his business called Unique Group. Mr Edmonds's lawyers have written to Antonio Horta-Osorio, chief executive of HBOS owner Lloyds, seeking payment. Two former employees at HBOS's Reading office were part of a £245m loans scam that cheated small business customers by insisting that they use a specific turnaround firm. The HBOS managers were then compensated with bribes including cash and prostitutes. They were eventually jailed along with four other people involved in the scam. Lloyds subsequently set up a £100m fund to compensate 64 victims of the fraud. Mr Edmonds's lawyer Jonathan Coad, from Keystone Law, said he would be pressing for half that amount to go to his client. \\"We expect half of the £100m to go to my client, and we expect Lloyds will have to increase their provision substantially,\\" Mr Coad said. Lloyds has said it would increase the amount of compensation if a review found that to be necessary.

It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack. Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated... answer the following question: What was the last name of the person who led 500 Americans in an unsuccessful attempt to capture the fort from about 100 British defenders?","output":"The last name of the person who led 500 Americans in an unsuccessful attempt to capture Fort Ticonderoga from about 100 British defenders is Brown.

Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another.

People wear masks and costumes during many such celebrations, allowing them to lose their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity. Excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods proscribed during Lent is extremely common. Other common features of carnival include mock battles such as food fights; social satire and mockery of authorities; the grotesque body displaying exaggerated features, especially large noses, bellies, mouths, and phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms.

The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds.

All the flights are booked, which forces him to take the train. The morning newspaper arrives and carries with it a detailed article on an altercation he'd been involved in. In the restaurant car, he meets Aditi Sengupta (Sharmila Tagore), a young journalist who edits a modern women's magazine, Adhunika.[2] Filled with contempt for the likes of him, she secretly plans to interview him because she thinks it'd attract more readers. He soon starts to reveal his personality, and also brings to surface the inner insecurities and his consciousness of the limitations of his 'powers'. Aditi initially takes notes, surreptitiously, but later on, out of empathy almost bordering on pity,stops. However, critical of the star, she interrogates him, leading to further introspection on his part. Slowly, his guilt about the way things turned out is very visible. Arindam also mentions Shankar-da, his mentor, who had never wanted Arindam to join films, being a strong opposer of the medium. He talks about his first day in film, and on the different experiences in faced with other workers in the field and some of the things that happened to them. Toward the end of the train journey, Arindam is drunk and feels a need to confide his wrongdoings. He asks the conductor to fetch Aditi. He begins to reveal the reason behind the altercation he was a part of, but Aditi stops him, as she has already guessed. It was an affair he'd had with one of his co-actors, Promila.

First, we have an equation that looks like this: 414*p = 5353 + 4997. Step 1: We need to add the numbers on the right side of the equation (5353 and 4997) to make it simpler. So, 5353 + 4997 = 10,350 Now, our equation looks like this: 414*p = 10,350. Step 2: To find the value of 'p', we need to divide the big number (10,350) by the number next to 'p' (414). So, we will divide 10,350 by 414 like this: 10,350/414 When we do the division, we get that p is about 25. So the final answer is: p ≈ 25. Great job helping me solve it! You're awesome!"},{"instruction":"Write a summary based on this article: New York University arts professor Wafaa Bilal, who recently implanted a camera in the back of his head, underwent surgery on Friday after his body rejected one of the titanium posts anchoring the device to his skull. Late last year, Bilal had the digital camera inserted into a two-inch hole drilled into the back of his head. According to The Chronicle of High Education, the body-modification artist who performed the surgery also installed three posts between Bilal's skin and skull to root the setup in place. Bilal intended to wear the camera around for a year as part of an art project, titled \\"The 3rd I,\\" commissioned for the opening of the Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art, reports the AP. \\"But the setup caused constant pain, because his body rejected one of the posts, despite treatment with antibiotics and steroids,\\" The Chronicle now writes. The troublesome post has been removed, but the other two remain. \\"I'm determined to continue with [the project],\\" Mr. Bilal said, according to The Chronicle. Bilal has reportedly tied the camera to his head and will continue to do so until his wound heals and the setup can be reinstalled.

My work to date has been concerned with the communication of public and private information to an audience so that it may be retold, distributed. The stories I tell are political dramas, which unfold through my past experience and into the present where they interact with the currency of media as the dialectic of aesthetic pleasure and pain. Through various layers of distribution and interpretation, pictures are drawn using interactive models established through the stories’ (technological) framework where they are revealed and shared. With an audience locked in participation, my story may be retold. The 3rdi is just such a platform for the telling and retelling of another story. A camera temporarily implanted on the back of my head, it spontaneously and objectively captures the images – one per minute – that make up my daily life, and transmits them to a website for public consumption. During my journey from Iraq to Saudi Arabia, on to Kuwait and then the U.S., I left many people and places behind. The images I have of this journey are inevitably ephemeral, held as they are in my own memory. Many times while I was in transit and chaos the images failed to fully register, I did not have the time to absorb them. Now, in hindsight, I wish I could have recorded these images so that I could look back on them, to have them serve as a reminder and record of all the places I was forced to leave behind and may never see again. The 3rdi arises from a need to objectively capture my past as it slips behind me from a non-confrontational point of view. It is anti-photography, decoded, and will capture images that are denoted rather than connoted, a technological-biological image. This will be accomplished by the complete removal of my hand and eye from the photographic process, circumventing the traditional conventions of traditional photography or a disruption in the photographic program. Barthes has said, \\"...from an aesthetic point of view the denoted image can appear as a kind of Edenic state of the image; cleared utopianically of its connotations, the image would become radically objective, or, in the last analysis, innocent.\\" It is this 'innocent' image that I wish to capture through the 3rdi. Technically, the 3rdi is an automatic photographic apparatus that is comprised of three different components: a small digital camera permanently surgically mounted to the back of my head with a USB connection, a lightweight laptop which I carry on my body connected to the camera with a USB cable, and a 3G wireless connection to access the internet. The website www.3rdi.me acts as storage and display for the images captured by the camera. The functioning of the apparatus, in theory, is as follows: The camera, through no intervention of the artist, captures an image automatically once a minute and send this image through the USB connection to the receiver (the computer) on my body. The receiver then sends this image through the 3G network to the website, where the images are archived and made available to the public. The 3rdi makes a technological apparatus part of my body and distributes the recorded content openly within space using the internet. The arbitrary imagery captured by the device will retain fractured records and distribute a narrative to be completed by the viewer as their corporeal space is also compromised by the presentation. Benjamin has described the storyteller as one “who could let the wick of his life be consumed completely by the gentle flame of his story.” (Illuminations) In this way I become locked to the story as its teller, passing the interpretive mode to an audience with little context so it may be transformed for their subjective interactions and subsequent expressions. Using this narrative triangle, the work will comment on ways in which imagery is used for the telling and retelling of stories, whether they belong to us or we make them ours. Installation Description In addition to the 3rdi device and its online presence, a physical installation opened December 15 in Doha, Qatar as part of the Told/Untold/Retold exhibition inaugurating the new Arab Museum of Modern Art. Hence the 3rdi is in total: a device, a website, and a larger installation that mimics the online platform from which the images are intended to be viewed. The installation will act as a concentrated display that asks the viewer to experience the images in both time space. The physical installation consists of three distinct rooms. The first, a smaller room, acts as an entrance to the main installation space and provides a separation from the gallery at large. This room prepares the viewer by providing information via wall text that describes the philosophy and background of the 3rdi project. The text is displayed on the wall to the right of the installation entrance. On the left is a medium-sized LCD display with a loop of a documentary on the 3rdi. The exit from this room is open and directly opposite it is a large wall partition that masks the exit from the second room, the main installation space. On this wall is a life-sized photo of the artist facing away from the camera with the 3rdi attached to his head. The partition leads the viewer to either the left or right to gain entrance to the main installation space. The main installation space is much larger than the first room. After walking around the partition the viewer is confronted by a large bank of small LCD screens, displaying the 3rdi images, stretching from the floor and curving to the ceiling. When a viewer gazes at a certain image, this image stays stable while the other images shift to form a virtual halo around the viewer. Opposite the LCD bank is a large mirrored surface that serves to double the images and broaden the space. The floor too is composed of a mirrored surface further doubling the images from the LCD displays and again broadening the space. The space itself is painted black. Interaction within this portion of the space is subject to both the number of bodies occupying the room and their movement within the space; the number and rate of images is affected by the number of people present. More people means faster movement of the images; with fewer viewers the images slow down. Movement through the space also triggers a flickering and whitening of the images. As a viewer moves from the entrance to the exit of the space, the images nearest them flicker and turn to white. The images in this mode of interaction are elusive to the viewer. An exit leads to a third room, where the viewer can sit and observe the images as they stream in live from the 3rdi device. This space is a viewing room and a reprieve from the previous installation space. Viewers here will be able to converse and discuss the images as they are transmitted. It is intended to be a sharp contrast to the overwhelming experience of the installation space, allowing the viewer to digest the prior experience while integrating the new information constantly coming in from the 3rdi. This portion of the installation has an exit into the gallery at large, ending the 3rdi space, and allowing the viewer to pursue the 3rdi on their own. On a whole the installation is intended to provide a broad viewing experience, similar to that of the internet, for the 3rdi apparatus. The extension of the 3rdi into physical space explores issues of perception, image recognition, surveillance, internet viewing, and information saturation. |||||","output":"Wafaa Bilal, a New York University arts professor, experienced a medical setback in his innovative art project \\"The 3rd I.\\" He was compelled to undergo surgery to remove a titanium post that anchored a camera to his skull after his body rejected it.

The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher,..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The information provided in the article does not answer the question about the full name of the person who started the National Anthem. The article talks about the history of promenade concerts in London and the involvement of conductor Wood, the manager of Queen's Hall Robert Newman, and his collaboration with sponsor Dr. George Cathcart. However, it does not mention the National Anthem. The full name of the person who wrote the United States National Anthem, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" is Francis Scott Key. If you are referring to another country's anthem, please specify which country, and I will try to help you find the answer."},{"instruction":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Matthew Paris, known as Matthew of Paris (Latin: Matthaeus Parisiensis, lit. \\"Matthew the Parisian\\"; c. 1200 - 1259), was a Benedictine monk, English chronicler, artist in illuminated manuscripts and cartographer, based at St Albans Abbey in Hertfordshire. He wrote a number of works, mostly historical, which he scribed and illuminated himself, typically in drawings partly coloured with watercolour washes, sometimes called \\"tinted drawings\\". Some were written in Latin, some in Anglo-Norman or French verse. From 1235, the point at which Wendover dropped his pen, Paris continued the history on the plan which his predecessors had followed. He derived much of his information from the letters of important people, which he sometimes inserts, but much more from conversation with the eyewitnesses of events. Among his informants were Richard, Earl of Cornwall and King Henry III, with whom he appears to have been on intimate terms. The king knew that Paris was writing a history, and wanted it to be as exact as possible. In 1257, in the course of a week's visit to St Albans, Henry kept the chronicler beside him night and day, \\"and guided my pen,\\" says Paris, \\"with much goodwill and diligence.\\" It is curious that the Chronica majora gives so unfavourable an account of the king's policy. Henry Richards Luard supposes that Paris never intended his work to be read in its present form. Many passages of the autograph have written next to them, the note offendiculum, which shows that the writer understood the danger which he ran. On the other hand, unexpurgated copies were made in Paris's lifetime. Although the offending passages are duly omitted or softened in his abridgment of his longer work, the Historia Anglorum (written about 1253), Paris's real feelings must have been an open secret. There is no ground for the old theory that he was an official historiographer. Naturalists have praised his descriptions of the English wildlife of his time, brief though they are: in particular his valuable description of the first irruption into England in 1254 of the common crossbill. was being a historian related to the church","output":"In the article, it is mentioned that Matthew Paris was a Benedictine monk based at St Albans Abbey in Hertfordshire. The fact that he was a monk indicates a connection to the church. Additionally, Matthew Paris wrote a history, and King Henry III wanted it to be as exact as possible. The quote that supports this is: \\"The king knew that Paris was writing a history, and wanted it to be as exact as possible. In 1257, in the course of a week's visit to St Albans, Henry kept the chronicler beside him night and day, 'and guided my pen,' says Paris, 'with much goodwill and diligence.'\\" Thus, it can be inferred that being a historian was related to the church in the case of Matthew Paris, as he was a Benedictine monk writing historical works."},{"instruction":"Barry Humphries plays Dame Edna Everage, but which character does he plays as the Australian Cultural Attache?

Here is a hypothesis: It was, Julius added, very tragic. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the given information Premise: The doctor kidded himself she took it herself, replied Julius dryly. Hypothesis: It was, Julius added, very tragic. Step 2: Identify the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis The premise provides information about an event, where a doctor seems to be kidding himself about a woman taking something herself (possibly medication). Julius is the one who conveys this information, and also dryly comments on the situation. The hypothesis provides information about Julius' additional comment, where he states that the situation was tragic. Step 3: Determine if the premise can support the hypothesis The premise provides context about the event and the doctor's thoughts, while the hypothesis presents Julius' perspective on the situation. It is important to note that Julius is the same person who provides both pieces of information. Step 4: Decide whether the premise implies the hypothesis In this case, if we assume that the premise is true (i.e., the doctor kidded himself), we can conclude that Julius believes the situation to be tragic. However, the truth of the premise alone doesn't guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. The reason is that determining whether something is tragic or not may depend on other factors or perspectives. The premise doesn't directly state that the situation is tragic; it only describes the doctor's thoughts and Julius providing that information. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is Julius' view of the situation. So, although Julius' opinion might be influenced by the premise, it isn't necessarily true that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. The hypothesis could be true, but it would require additional information or perspectives to make a definite conclusion. In conclusion, based on the given premise, it is not possible to directly conclude that the hypothesis is true.

Lowercase letters, also known as minuscule letters, were developed during the Middle Ages to improve the efficiency of writing and reading. They were designed to be more cursive and easier to write when compared to uppercase, or capital, letters. The use of uppercase and lowercase letters together is known as bicameral script, which includes two cases: uppercase (majuscule) and lowercase (minuscule). Lowercase letters are commonly used in everyday writing, such as in books, articles, and general communication. Using lowercase letters assists in distinguishing proper nouns, which are typically capitalized, from common nouns. This distinction aids in comprehension and provides context when reading. Moreover, changes in capitalization can alter the meaning of certain words or phrases. For example, the transformation from uppercase to lowercase can indicate the difference between a specific proper noun (such as a name like \\"John\\") and a general noun (such as \\"john,\\" which is slang for a toilet). Thus, proper capitalization is essential in delivering accurate and comprehensible information. Additionally, the use of lowercase letters can affect the perception of communication. Writing in all capital letters is often perceived as shouting or aggression, while using lowercase letters conveys a more informal and approachable tone. This distinction is especially important in digital communication, where body language and tone of voice are absent, making it crucial to convey the intended message effectively. In the case of \\"drum trust you out of cover,\\" it is not entirely clear what message the text aims to communicate. However, converting the text to lowercase does serve to make the text appear more approachable and informal. In conclusion, converting text to lowercase has several benefits, including increased readability, improved context and comprehension, and an informal presentation. The history of lowercase letters stems from a need for efficiency in writing and reading, and they continue to be an essential component of written communication in our modern society."},{"instruction":"Information: - Vanuatu (or ; Bislama ), officially the Republic of Vanuatu (Bislama: \\"Ripablik blong Vanuatu\\"), is a Pacific island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean.

The first of Newtown’s residents began walking down the roadway while it was still daylight, more than three hours before President Obama was scheduled to speak. They started the trek at the main intersection in the village of Sandy Hook. On one corner, under a two-story Christmas tree, they paused to place stuffed animals, signs and flowers by the hundreds. On the other side of the village’s only stoplight, Riverside Drive leads up a hill to the site of the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It’s exactly one mile along Berkshire Road to Newtown High School, and they walked by the dozens, a few at first and then a steady stream through the freezing rain. When they reached the high school, they quietly formed an unbroken serpentine line that snaked through the parking lot. Those who weren’t from Newtown came from neighboring towns and villages, and from New York and New Jersey. A group of more than 100 Sikhs drove from four congregations in Massachusetts to show their solidarity with the people of Newtown. “We were devastated when one of our places of worship was attacked,” says Sarbpreet Singh, referring to the August shooting at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek. “We are no less devastated today.” (PHOTOS: Connecticut Community Copes After School Shooting) As volunteers from the Red Cross moved up and down the line, handing out blankets and stuffed toys for the children, the gymnasium where the President was to speak filled up, and the remaining crowd members were told they would be sent to overflow rooms. Some left, saying they could do better watching at home, but the vast majority stayed in line, wishing, at the very least, to be gathered with others while searching for answers as to why one young local resident had murdered 20 of Newtown’s young children. It is a question that has plagued this town since 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 14, when the first reports emerged of a shooting at the school. Over the weekend, with each new detail, the madness behind it all seemed to grow exponentially until it seemed greater than the sum of its parts. After shooting his mother in the head, 20-year-old Adam Lanza drove to the elementary school, shot the principal and other members of the staff and then, using a weapon similar to those carried by soldiers and Marines, fired bullets meant to kill insurgents into the bodies of children still young enough to have their baby teeth. Later reports from police officials said Lanza had hundreds of rounds left over when he took his own life. After 2½ days of grieving, crying, praying and questioning, the people of Newtown turned out in droves for the visit from the President. The Commander in Chief, who in his tenure has had to be comforter in chief for five mass shootings, three hurricanes, two tornadoes and a giant oil spill, faced the challenge of trying to catalyze the process of healing amid anger, disbelief and sorrow. Many expected Obama to talk about gun control, which has leaped to the forefront of national discourse in a way that didn’t occur after the massacre in Aurora, Colo., in July. He would, but without using the word gun once. Others wanted compassion and understanding, and a discussion of the broader complexities of guns, mental illness, the culture of violence and how our busy, digitally connected lives sometimes leave young people to be forgotten. He would too. The speech would be greater than the sum of its parts. (MORE: Mass Murder: Why Are Schools Such a Common Target?) Sunday night’s vigil was an interfaith service, with readings from Jewish traditions, the Koran and Scripture. Monsignor Raymond Weiss of St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church, who would help close the ceremony after the President spoke, had tried to comfort congregants on the night of the tragedy, saying, “There are 20 brighter stars in the heavens.” It was a metaphor that resonated in the community. When Obama took to the stage, he acknowledged the similarities of the eclectic teachings, each of which reflected a search for answers to the tragedy. “All the world’s religions — so many of them represented here today — start with a simple question: Why are we here? What gives our life meaning?” he said. “We know our time on this earth is fleeting,” he continued. “We know that we will each have our share of pleasure and pain … We know that no matter how good our intentions, we will all stumble sometimes, in some way. We will make mistakes; we will experience hardships. And even when we’re trying to do the right thing, we know that much of our time will be spent groping through the darkness, so often unable to discern God’s heavenly plans.” (MORE: ‘These Tragedies Must End’: Obama Promises Change at Newtown Vigil, but Can He Deliver?) Obama issued a call to action — of sorts — with a rhetorical question that may well prove to be a rallying argument for new gun-control legislation. “Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom?” he asked. And yet it was not an overtly political speech. It was religious in focus and solemn in tone, and for the dozens of people left out in the cold when the school reached capacity, it seemed to provide some measure of the comfort they had been seeking. They huddled together for warmth and reassurance; some held candles, nodding to the President’s message that life is precious but also fleeting. Finally, the gathered mourners listened between tears and sobs as the President, who earlier in the speech named the school staff members who died in the shooting, began a litany of the 20 children, pausing briefly but meaningfully between each name: “Charlotte, Daniel, Olivia, Josephine, Ana, Dylan, Madeleine, Catherine, Chase, Jesse, James, Grace, Emilie, Jack, Noah, Caroline, Jessica, Benjamin, Avielle, Allison.” Twenty brighter stars in the heavens.

Originally from Essendon, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia, Steve was raised with a love for wildlife from an early age, largely in part to his parents, Bob and Lyn Irwin, who were wildlife enthusiasts. In 1970, the Irwin family moved to Queensland, where his parents started a small reptile park, now known as the Australia Zoo. Steve Irwin's adventures were first televised in the 1992 Australian TV series \\"The Crocodile Hunter.\\" The program found worldwide success as it showcased Steve's remarkable wildlife expertise and daring encounters with various dangerous animals such as snakes, crocodiles, and spiders. The show aired for five seasons, from 1997 to 2004, and was broadcast in over 130 countries, making Steve Irwin a household name. Steve's charismatic and enthusiastic personality, combined with his genuine passion for conservation, attracted millions of fans and followers. He was widely admired for promoting the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats. Beyond \\"The Crocodile Hunter,\\" Irwin also appeared in other TV shows and documentaries such as \\"Croc Files,\\" \\"The Crocodile Hunter Diaries,\\" \\"New Breed Vets,\\" and \\"Ocean's Deadliest.\\" Unfortunately, Steve Irwin's life was tragically cut short on September 4, 2006, when he passed away after a stingray barb pierced his heart during the filming of \\"Ocean's Deadliest.\\" His death was a significant loss to the conservation and wildlife community.

Albrecht the Elder had travelled to Flanders and from working with Netherlandish artists had acquired a strong appreciation for the work of both Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. That he passed on this influence to his son is evident from the early use of silverpoint, a medium which according to Erwin Panofsky requires \\"an exceptional degree of confidence, accuracy and sensitive feeling for its successful handling\\". Dürer would have been aware of Hans Pleydenwurff's portrait of the ageing Count Georg von Lowenstein, through his teacher Michael Wolgemut. Pleydenwurff's portrait was in turn likely influenced by van Eyck's 1438 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. Von Fircks believes the portrait of Dürer's father took from Pleydenwurff's portrait, which she describes as a \\"highly detailed representation of [a] white haired old man, who defies the pains of growing old with an alert mind and an inner animation\\".Von Fircks notes that Dürer's 1484 self-portrait was created with the use of a mirror while his most iconic work is a self-portrait; the 1500 Self-Portrait at Twenty-Eight. From these she concludes that the \\"accurate observation and documentary recording\\" of both his own and his parents' appearances over time was not just a compulsion, but that is indicative of a deeper interest in the effects of time and age on human appearance. Although Dürer was fascinated by the effects of ageing on others, he seems to have had some hesitancy at examining how it might affect him personally. The... answer the following question: What was the name of the person who drew Man of Sorrows? Answer:","output":"The name of the person who drew Man of Sorrows is Albrecht Dürer. He was a prominent German artist known for his paintings, engravings, and woodcuts, and he played a significant role in the Northern Renaissance. The Man of Sorrows is one of Dürer's renowned works, depicting Christ's suffering and the theme of human redemption."},{"instruction":"Article: This is my schoolbag.

He has a broken leg and is suffering from amnesia. He hallucinates about a woman (Caroline Dhavernas) finding him. He also drives away a cougar after giving two warning shots from a revolver he retrieved inside the car. After a few days of being stuck in that position, he manages to escape the car by prying out the car door with a shifter lever. In the car, he finds bags of money and hears on the car radio about an armed robbery by a man named Raymond Plazzy. Finding a credit card under the passenger seat in the name of Raymond Plazzy, The Man assumes that he is Raymond Plazzy and that he committed the robbery. A man (Adrian Holmes) wearing hunting gear emerges from the woods and starts to loot the wrecked car. The Man tries to get help from the hunter, who just runs away with some of the stolen money. A dog appears, and The Man follows it into the woods. He finds a working cell phone inside a cave, discovering the tragic fate of the hunter who was possibly attacked by the cougar. The Man cannot obtain a signal in the woods. Frequently hallucinating about the woman, he finally shoots her with the revolver after realizing the hallucination led him back to the car. He then decides to get out of the ravine. After crawling for days, he finds a road and a dead body with a driver's license that says Raymond Plazzy. He then pieces together what happened to him: He was running errands with his wife (the Woman) when he witnessed an armed robbery and was taken hostage by Plazzy.

Question: suppose wound is disinfected happens, how will it affect less bacteria to reproduce. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"B: less When a wound is disinfected, the chances of bacteria reproducing and spreading are significantly reduced. Disinfecting a wound involves the process of cleaning and treating the affected area with antiseptic solutions or ointments to remove or kill pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi. This helps to minimize the risk of infection and facilitates the healing process. Disinfection of a wound can be done through various methods, such as directly applying an antiseptic solution, using an antiseptic-impregnated dressing, or washing the wound with water and soap before applying a suitable dressing. Some commonly used disinfectants include hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, iodine, and povidone-iodine. By reducing the number of bacteria present in the wound, there will be less bacteria available to reproduce. This minimizes the potential for bacterial colonies to grow, multiply, and spread within the wound, or to invade surrounding tissues. Thus, proper disinfection of a wound can greatly influence the prevention or control of potential bacterial infections. Furthermore, keeping the wound clean and dry, as well as proper wound dressing techniques, can also contribute to a decrease in bacterial colonization. Regularly changing the dressings, avoiding contamination of the wound by hands or objects, and seeking medical advice if the wound shows signs of infection (e.g., excessive redness, swelling, or pus) are also important steps to minimize the likelihood of bacterial reproduction and infection. In summary, disinfecting a wound significantly reduces the presence of bacteria, leading to less bacteria available for reproduction and spread. This lowers the chances of infection and promotes faster and more effective healing."},{"instruction":"Q:This article: In August 1953, Presley checked into the offices of Sun Records. He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: \\"My Happiness\\" and \\"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\\". He later claimed that he intended the record as a gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he \\"sounded like\\", although there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer Peter Guralnick argued that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist Marion Keisker what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, \\"I sing all kinds.\\" When she pressed him on who he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, \\"I don't sound like nobody.\\" After he recorded, Sun boss Sam Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: \\"Good ballad singer.

Which county experienced more infiltration? Hint: Precipitation can impact infiltration in many ways. The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur.","output":"Given the information presented, it is clear that Dirk County experienced more infiltration due to the weather phenomena this past month. There are multiple factors that contributed to this conclusion, which include the amount, type, and duration of precipitation experienced in both counties. In Dirk County, the weather phenomena consisted of immense precipitation, leading to many flood events. This steady rain, along with the massive water infiltration, has caused significant soil saturation. As more precipitation occurs, greater infiltration follows until the ground reaches its saturation point. The amount of precipitation in Dirk County, therefore, has resulted in increased infiltration. Comparatively, Saulk County experienced a few thunderstorms. Although some runoff occurred, there was less infiltration and soil saturation in this region. The difference in the type of precipitation between the two counties played a vital role in infiltration. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than other types of precipitation such as snow or sleet. Therefore, Dirk County, receiving steady rainfall, experienced more infiltration than Saulk County, with only a few thunderstorms. Lastly, the duration of rainfall also impacts infiltration capacity. As Dirk County had steady rain for an extended period, the initial rapid infiltration gradually slowed as the soil became more saturated. However, this prolonged rainfall contributed to the overall infiltration being higher in Dirk County since the precipitation event lasted for a longer duration. In conclusion, Dirk County experienced higher infiltration due to the greater amount, steady nature, and extended duration of the precipitation events in comparison to Saulk County. The impact of these factors combined created higher soil saturation levels in Dirk County, leading to increased infiltration. Consequently, runoffs occurred at a lesser rate in Dirk County due to higher infiltration capacity, whereas, in Saulk County, despite fewer infiltration and saturation levels, runoffs occurred at a comparatively higher rate due to its lower infiltration capacity and shorter duration precipitation events."},{"instruction":"When you see new people move in next door you might find it what?

In addition, it also contributes to building healthy bones. Make sure you are getting enough magnesium in your daily diet to help absorb the calcium supplements you're taking. To increase your magnesium, eat whole grains, vegetables such as summer squash, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers, and spinach, and nuts and seeds. Adult women under 30 need 310 milligrams a day, while women over 30 need 320 milligrams. Men need 400 milligrams before 30 and 420 milligrams after 30. An ounce of almonds has 80 milligrams of magnesium. If your supplement needs are greater than 500 milligrams per day after accounting for the calcium consumed in your diet, split up your supplement. Your body is only able to process up to 500 milligram at a time. Taking more calcium than you need can be dangerous. It increases your chance of having kidney stones and may also contribute to problems with your heart. Preteens and teenagers (ages 9 to 18) need 1,300mg of calcium per day. Vitamin D also contributes to absorbing calcium into your system. Because of this relationship, most milk has added vitamin D to help you take in the calcium. Many dairy products, such as butter, cheese, and milk have vitamin D. Fortified cereals and fish are also good sources of this vitamin. For adults under 70 years of age, 600 international units of vitamin D per day is sufficient. Adults over 70 should consume 800 international units. To get your recommended intake, 3 ounces of swordfish has 566 international units, while a cup of milk has 115 to 124 international units per serving. This type of calcium, which is readily available, is best taken with food. It needs stomach acid to be absorbed properly, and the food activates your stomach acid. Other types of calcium, such as calcium citrate, does not need to be taken with food. This type of calcium is usually more expensive than calcium carbonate. This type is especially good for people who have stomach issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome. The same is true of your multivitamin if your multivitamin contains iron. Your body processes iron and calcium in much the same way, so taking them at the same time interferes with the body's ability to absorb both. The same rule applies to food and beverages consumed with both supplements. Calcium supplements should not be taken with foods high in iron, such as liver or spinach. Iron supplements should not be taken with calcium-rich products like a glass of milk. These acids can bind with calcium and keep it from being absorbed. Many foods high in magnesium are also high in these acids. Therefore, while it's important to eat these foods to get the magnesium you need, you should avoid taking your supplement along with these foods. For instance, spinach, many nuts and seeds, rhubarb, sweet potatoes, beans, and collard greens are all high in phytic and oxalic acids. Whole grains and wheat are also high in these acids, but don't seem to affect calcium absorption as much as other foods in this category. Alcohol can decrease your body's absorption of calcium. On average, don't drink more than one drink a day if you're a woman and two drinks a day if you're a man. \\"One drink\\" is the equivalent of 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of liquor.","output":"Magnesium is an essential element that aids in calcium absorption and contributes to building healthy bones. To ensure adequate magnesium intake, consume whole grains, vegetables like summer squash, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers, and spinach, as well as nuts and seeds. The daily recommended amounts of magnesium differ for men and women based on age. Calcium is vital for maintaining strong bones, and its optimal intake, particularly for preteens and teenagers, is crucial to prevent health issues. Vitamin D plays a vital role in calcium absorption and can be found in various foods, such as dairy products, fortified cereals, and fish. The recommended daily intake of vitamin D differs for adults under 70 years and those 70 and above. Calcium supplements come in different forms; calcium carbonate requires consumption with food for better absorption, while calcium citrate can be consumed without food. It is essential to avoid taking calcium along with iron-rich foods or iron supplements, as they can interfere with the absorption process. Certain foods high in phytic and oxalic acids can bind with calcium and hinder absorption. While it is essential to consume these foods for magnesium intake, avoid taking calcium supplements alongside them. Foods rich in these acids include spinach, nuts and seeds, rhubarb, sweet potatoes, beans, collard greens, and whole grains. Alcohol consumption can negatively impact calcium absorption. Limit alcohol intake to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. Remember that over-consuming calcium supplements can result in kidney stones and heart issues. Additionally, note that the body can process up to 500 milligrams of calcium at a time, and it's ideal to split the dosage if greater than this amount."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Mutual Friends is a British comedy drama television series broadcast in six episodes on BBC One in from 26 August until 30 September 2008.

Which pot is closer to boiling? Tim is trying to boil two pots of water, pot A and pot B. Tim has a device which lets him see what the average kinetic energy is of the particles in each pot is. After examining each pot, Tim discovers that pot A has particles with a very high average kinetic energy, and pot B's particles have a low average kinetic energy. Hint: The particles of soup have greater average kinetic energy than the particles of water in the tub, explaining why the soup has a higher temperature. However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.” The answer is:","output":"Pot A is closer to boiling. The reason for this is because the average kinetic energy of the particles in pot A is significantly higher than the particles in pot B. When a substance is heated, its particles gain more kinetic energy, and when they have enough energy, the substance undergoes a phase transition, such as water boiling and turning into steam. In this case, since pot A has a higher average kinetic energy, the water particles are likely moving faster and with more collisions, which indicates that they are closer to reaching the boiling point. In the given hint, the relationship between temperature and average kinetic energy was used to explain why the soup has a higher temperature than the water in the tub. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy in a substance, and a higher average kinetic energy leads to a higher temperature. Therefore, it can be inferred from the hint that a substance with a greater average kinetic energy will have a higher temperature and be closer to boiling. Additionally, the hint also explains the difference between thermal energy and temperature. While the water in the tub may have a greater total kinetic energy (thermal energy) due to the large number of particles and higher mass, the average kinetic energy of these particles is lower than that of the soup in the pot. This means that the water in the tub is not as close to boiling as the soup, despite having more thermal energy. In conclusion, based on the information provided about the average kinetic energies of the particles in pot A and pot B, it is clear that pot A is closer to boiling. This is because the higher average kinetic energy of the particles in pot A suggests a higher temperature, which indicates that it is closer to reaching the boiling point."},{"instruction":"The current Chief Executive is Nick Hawkins , who replaces Rob Powell in October 2017 .

In a first-person take, Saga Vanecek says she was in search of rocks to skim from the bottom of Lake Vidostern in the southern part of the country when she hit upon something that felt like a stick. “Daddy, I’ve found a sword!” she recalls saying as she raised it like a warrior, making her the first to touch the weapon in some 1,500 years. Saga says she was forced to keep the historic find a secret while local officials investigated and sought to find other relics without interference from other treasure hunters. Even worse, she couldn't keep the sword! \\"I had to give the sword to the local museum–Daddy explained that it’s part of history and important to share it with others,\\" she laments. Meanwhile, Saga says she raising money in a bid to have a replica of the sword made. The BBC notes the water level in the lake was low due to drought, which made it easier for Saga to find the sword. An expert from a local museum says the \\"exceptionally preserved\\" sword is about 33 inches long and came in a wood-and-leather sheath. A brooch was also found in the lake, but how the weapon came to be there remains a mystery. What's clear is that the major find has made Saga a star and, perhaps, even a monarch. \\"People on the internet are saying I am the queen of Sweden,\\" Saga says. (An even older, and controversial, find was made in Switzerland last year.)","output":"Title: The Girl Who Raised a Sword: Saga Vanecek's Incredible Discovery In the summer of 2018, an 8-year-old girl named Saga Vanecek stumbled upon a fascinating piece of history when she found a pre-Viking sword in the depths of a Swedish lake. The discovery made headlines all over the world, and now, Saga has shared her side of the story in a first-person account with the Guardian. It all began on a warm day in southern Sweden when Saga ventured to Lake Vidöstern to search for rocks to skim. Little did she know, she was about to unearth a piece of history. As she felt around the lake bed, Saga's hand hit something that felt like a stick. Excited, she pulled the object out of the water and, in her own words, exclaimed, \\"Daddy, I’ve found a sword!\\" Fittingly, she raised her prize like a warrior, becoming the first person in approximately 1,500 years to touch the weapon. As word of Saga's incredible find spread, local officials urged the young girl to keep her discovery a secret during the initial investigation to prevent interference from opportunistic treasure hunters. This meant that not only did Saga have to hide the fact that she had found a remarkable piece of ancient history, but she couldn't even keep the sword for herself. Instead, she had to give it to the local museum, as her father explained that the artifact was an essential part of history and should be shared with others. The sword, which measures about 33 inches long and was found with a wood-and-leather sheath, is said to be \\"exceptionally preserved.\\" This extraordinary preservation may be credited to the unusually low water level in the lake during a drought, which made it easier for Saga to find the sword. Along with the weapon, a brooch was also discovered in the vicinity, although the reason that the artifacts found themselves in the lake remains a mystery. Saga's life has changed since her fateful discovery, as her story has captivated people around the world. Many on the internet have even dubbed her the \\"queen of Sweden.\\" Unperturbed by her newfound fame, Saga is now focused on raising funds to have a replica of the sword made for herself, ensuring she can hold a piece of history in her hands once more. Though some may see Saga's discovery as a simple stroke of luck, her story demonstrates the immense cultural and historical value hidden beneath the surface of our everyday surroundings. It's a reminder to us all that we share our world with the echoes of the past, and sometimes, it takes a chance encounter —or an 8-year-old girl searching for rocks— to bring those echoes back to life."},{"instruction":"Ask a question about Asphalt.","output":"Step 1: Identify a relevant topic related to Asphalt In order to ask a question, I'll first choose a subject related to Asphalt.

Which test would see decrease in pressure, case A or case B? David was trying to see how steam engines work. For that, he conducted two tests, test A and test B. In test A, he used low temperature. On the other hand, in test B, he used high temperature. David started thinking about how he could use the results of his tests in everyday life. Hint: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. The answer to this question is:","output":"The test that would see a decrease in pressure is case A, in which low temperature is used. According to the hint provided, decreasing the temperature has the opposite effect of increasing it; thus, the pressure of an enclosed gas, such as the one in the cylinder, would decrease. In test B, where high temperature is used, the pressure would increase as the kinetic energy of gas molecules increases, resulting in more forceful collisions with the container walls."},{"instruction":"Choose the next sentence for this paragraph.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - More than a year after the German city of Munich declared its landmark intention to abandon Microsoft Windows in favor of upstart rival Linux, its councillors are finally ready to go ahead with the plan.","output":"This article is about a significant decision made by the city of Munich, Germany, to switch from Microsoft Windows to Linux operating systems in its city administration's computer systems. The news highlights the city's bold move to rely on open-source software and emphasizes the growing popularity of Linux as a potential competitor to Microsoft Windows. First, let's analyze the context of this choice. Microsoft Windows has long been the leading operating system for personal computers, businesses, and government organizations alike. Its user-friendly interface and compatibility with a wide array of hardware and software has made it the go-to choice for many. In recent years, however, concerns related to cost, security, and flexibility have prompted some organizations to explore alternatives. Enter Linux, an open-source operating system that has been slowly gaining traction for the better part of two decades. Unlike proprietary software such as Windows, Linux allows for greater customization and control over its source code, making it an appealing choice for those looking for more autonomy in managing their systems. This open-source model also cuts down on licensing fees and long-term maintenance costs, which can be significantly lower in comparison to what's typically required with Windows. Munich's landmark decision to abandon Windows in favor of Linux demonstrates the city's commitment to exploring cost-effective, secure, and flexible alternatives to conventional software solutions. Faced with mounting licensing fees and obsolescence issues with its existing Windows-based systems, the city sought a more sustainable solution and began considering the open-source Linux operating system. After a year of careful deliberation, Munich's councillors finally felt confident in their decision to move forward with the switch to Linux. This choice marks a notable victory for the open-source community and could potentially influence other organizations and cities to follow suit in reevaluating their reliance on proprietary software. The transition from Microsoft Windows to Linux would involve the migration of the entire city administration's computer systems, including thousands of workstations, servers, and other related infrastructure. This process can be challenging and time-consuming, as it involves retraining employees, developing new workflows, and ensuring compatibility with existing applications and hardware. Despite these challenges, Munich's decision makers believe that the long-term benefits of switching to Linux outweigh the initial costs and potential setbacks. In conclusion, the article discusses the city of Munich's significant decision to switch from Microsoft Windows to the Linux operating system for its administrative computer systems. This bold move highlights the growing popularity and viability of open-source software as a genuine alternative to proprietary solutions. It also underscores the potential for other organizations and governments to consider the adoption of Linux and other open-source options, leading to greater flexibility, security, and cost-efficiency in the long run."},{"instruction":"Balkanlar'da yaz mevsimi, deniz ve güneş demek Could you please translate this to English?","output":"In the Balkans, the summer season means sea and sun.

Starting with the 2013–14 season, these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons. Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues (the average Premier League team receives £55 million while the average Football League Championship club receives £2 million), critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not, leading to the common occurrence of teams \\"bouncing back\\" soon after their relegation. For some clubs who have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League, financial problems, including in some cases administration or even liquidation have followed. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have ensued for several clubs unable to cope with the gap. How does this compare an average Premier League team?","output":"Okay, let me explain this in a simple way. The Premier League is like a big party where the teams make a lot of money from TV shows. When a team has to leave the party, they get some money called \\"parachute payments\\" to help them feel better and adjust to having less money. Now, an average Premier League team makes about £55 million from these TV shows. But when they have to leave, they still get around £60 million over four years to help them. This is a lot more than other teams that didn't get into the Premier League, as they only make £2 million. Some people think that this extra money makes it difficult for other teams to compete because teams that just left the party still have more money. This can help them return to the Premier League faster. But for some teams, not going back to the Premier League quickly can cause money problems. They might not have enough to pay their bills, and they can face even more difficulties, like going down to lower leagues in football. So, an average Premier League team makes a lot more money than other teams, but these \\"parachute payments\\" can cause some issues and differences between the teams."},{"instruction":"Here is some data about a restaurant: name = The Waterman, eatType = pub, food = Chinese, priceRange = moderate, area = city centre.

The Kathlamet people originally spoke the Kathlamet language, a dialect of the Chinookan language. They were also called \\"Guasámas, or Guithlamethl, by the Clackamas\\", and \\"Kwillu'chini, by the Chinook.\\" Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Kathlamet language is very famous.","output":"While it is true that the Kathlamet people spoke the Kathlamet language, which was a dialect of the Chinookan language, in their historical homeland along the Columbia River in present-day southwestern Washington state, describing it as \\"very famous\\" might not capture the complete essence of the language and its significance. Instead, it would be more accurate to consider the Kathlamet language as an important and distinctive part of the cultural heritage of the Kathlamet people. As a dialect of the Chinookan language, the Kathlamet language reflects the unique linguistic features, customs, and traditions of its speakers. The Kathlamet people had cultural and trading connections with other Native American tribes within the region, such as the Clackamas and the Chinook. This allowed for linguistic exchange and contributed to the common linguistic heritage in the area. It is important to note that due to the passage of time and unfortunate circumstances like colonization, many indigenous languages, including the Kathlamet language, have been lost or endangered. Preserving the memory of these languages is essential to honoring the history and cultural richness of the tribes that spoke them, including the Kathlamet people. It is through the study and documentation of these languages that researchers and communities can broaden their understanding of the history, interactions, and migrations of Native American tribes in North America. In conclusion, while the Kathlamet language may not be widely recognized as \\"very famous,\\" it holds a significant place in the cultural history of the Kathlamet people, as well as within the broader linguistic landscape of Chinookan languages and Aboriginal communities in the Pacific Northwest. Recognizing the importance of this language and working to preserve its memory helps to maintain the rich heritage and interconnectedness of these indigenous communities."},{"instruction":"Information: - A pub, or public house, is an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic drinks, which traditionally include beer, ale and other brewed alcoholic drinks. It is a relaxed, social drinking establishment and a prominent part of British culture, Irish culture, New Zealand culture and Australian culture. In many places, especially in villages, a pub is the focal point of the community. In his 17th century diary Samuel Pepys described the pub as \\"the heart of England.\\" - Samuel Pepys (; 23 February 1633 26 May 1703) was an administrator of the navy of England and Member of Parliament who is most famous for the diary that he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man. Pepys had no maritime experience, but he rose to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and King James II through patronage, hard work, and his talent for administration. His influence and reforms at the Admiralty were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy. - Introduction. An award is something given to a person, a group of people, or an organization to recognize their excellence in a certain field; a certificate of excellence. Awards are often signified by trophies, titles, certificates, commemorative plaques, medals, badges, pins, or ribbons. An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient; for example, the Nobel Prize for contributions to society or the Pulitzer Prize for literary achievements. An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize of excellence. - A resource is a source or supply from which benefit is produced. Resources are two types based upon their availability they are renewable and non renewable resource s.Typically resources are materials, energy, services, staff, knowledge, or other assets that are transformed to produce benefit and in the process may be consumed or made unavailable. Benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth or wants, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well being. From a human perspective a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants. From a broader biological or ecological perspective a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource). - Leadership is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or organization to \\"lead\\" or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations. The literature debates various viewpoints: contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) US vs. European approaches. US academic environments define leadership as \\"a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task\\". Leadership seen from a European and non-academic perspective encompasses a view of a leader who can be moved not only by communitarian goals but also by the search for personal power. - In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. Thus, cutting a cake, where taking a larger piece reduces the amount of cake available for others, is a zero-sum game if all participants value each unit of cake equally (see marginal utility). - A drinking establishment is a business whose primary function is the serving of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Some establishments may also serve food, or have entertainment, but their main purpose is to serve alcoholic beverages. There are different types of drinking establishment ranging from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \\"dive bars\\", to 5,000 seat beer halls and elegant places of entertainment for the elite. A public house, informally known as a \\"pub\\", is an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises in countries and regions of British influence. Although the terms are increasingly used to refer to the same thing, there is a difference between pubs, bars, inns, taverns and lounges where alcohol is served commercially. A tavern or pot-house is, loosely, a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and, more than likely, also be served food, though not licensed to put up guests. The word derives from the Latin \\"taberna\\" and the Greek \\"\\"/taverna. - A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). - An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of ethanol (informally called \\"alcohol\\"), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism. - The National Pub of the Year is an annual competition held by CAMRA in February that finds the best pub in the UK . Established in 1988 , the competition helps to highlight quality pubs around the UK that are worth seeking out and visiting . Each year , each local CAMRA branch nominates one pub in their area to be entered . These 200 pubs then go through to the regional competition , which then whittles down to 4 pubs to go to the national final . The pubs in the national final are evaluated on : Quality of the Real Ales served Value for money Atmosphere Interior decoration Customer service and welcome - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties. - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (a zero-sum game).

His mother is a dancer and ballerina turned visual artist and clothing jewelry designer. His father is a Vietnam War veteran who had numerous jobs. LaBeouf's mother is Jewish, and his father, who is of Cajun descent, is Christian. On December 17, 2013, LaBeouf released his short film Howard Cantour.com to the Internet; shortly thereafter, several bloggers noted its close similarity to Justin M. Damiano, a 2007 comic by Ghost World creator Dan Clowes. Wired journalist Graeme McMillan noted at least three similarities in their article, one of which was that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical. LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead \\"inspired\\" by him and \\"got lost in the creative process.\\" He followed this up with several apologies via Twitter writing, \\"In my excitement and naivete as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation\\", and \\"I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to know that I have a great respect for his work\\". Clowes responded by saying \\"The first I ever heard of the film was this morning when someone sent me a link. I've never spoken to or met Mr. LaBeouf ... I actually can't imagine what was going through his mind.\\" LaBeouf was criticized over his apology, with some sites such as The A.V. Club noting that the apology itself appeared to have been lifted from a 2010 post on Yahoo! Answers. Since the initial discovery of the plagiarism of Clowe's work, LaBeouf's other work has come under scrutiny. News outlets reported that LaBeouf's comic books, Let's Fucking Party and Stale N Mate, had been plagiarized from Benoit Duteurtre's The Little Girl and the Cigarette and Charles Bukowski's Assault. In January 2014, LaBeouf spoke about the plagiarism accusations with Bleeding Cool writer Rich Johnston, where he stated that he saw copyright laws as too restrictive and that it did not allow for ideas to flow freely. LaBeouf later tweeted a description of his next project, Daniel Boring (a reference to David Boring, another comic created by Clowes). The description of the project was also taken word-for-word from a description by Clowes of his comic.

Solve n + 1 = -3 for n.","output":"To solve the given equation n + 1 = -3 for the variable 'n,' we need to isolate 'n' on one side of the equation. To do this, we follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the equation The given equation is n + 1 = -3. Step 2: Identify the goal The goal is to solve for 'n.' Step 3: Isolate the variable 'n' In this step, we will isolate 'n' on one side of the equation. Since we have 'n' on the left side of the equation, we will isolate 'n' on the left side. The equation is in the form n + 1 = -3. We need to eliminate the '+1' term on the left side of the equation. To do this, we will perform the inverse operation. The inverse operation of addition is subtraction. So, we will subtract 1 from both sides of the equation in order to cancel out the '+1' term on the left side. n + 1 - 1 = -3 - 1 Now, the '+1' and '-1' on the left side of the equation will cancel each other out, leaving only 'n': n = -3 - 1 Step 4: Simplify the equation Now we need to simplify the right side of the equation by performing the arithmetic operation: n = -4 So, the solution to the given equation n + 1 = -3 is n = -4."},{"instruction":"Available options: * No; * Yes; Question: how does milk turn into different types of cheeses?

Why is zombie Bobby taking a shower? And can Texans really pull off a cowboy hat with a suit? A new incarnation of the groundbreaking television saga that raised these questions will return to TNT June 13. The new series isn't just a remake; it's a continuation of the original, which means that television's most notorious family is back in the Big D. But the city has changed a lot since we last checked in with J.R. and company. For instance, it lost a lot of oil derricks and gained a few modern marvels, including a signature bridge and a stadium that rivals the construction of the Death Star. Women's hairstyles aren't as high and neither are the peaks of 10-gallon Stetsons. The Dallas Cowboys are now a source of great embarrassment and the Texas Rangers are the pride of the metroplex. But that's not to say there isn't still plenty of the unapologetic glam and high-society Western culture celebrated in the show's original 14 seasons. The Ewing clan would feel just as at home in today's Dallas as they did during the series' heyday. Here are a few spots where you just might run into them. 'Dallas' vs. Dallas: Where TV stops and reality begins Five Sixty by Wolfgang Puck at Reunion Tower Built in 1978, the same year \\"Dallas\\" premiered on CBS, Reunion Tower served as Dallas' most iconic building for three decades before the \\"Big Ball\\" underwent a much-needed makeover. Now Reunion Tower boasts one of the finest dining experiences in Dallas, with a 560-foot-high revolving restaurant and an Asian fusion menu crafted by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Summer Travel: World's best affordable beach resorts J.R. wouldn't be caught dead in this dive bar that's covered floor to ceiling in graffiti, photos, stickers, neon lights and mounted horns. But a younger Ewing would feel right at home at Adair's, where you're likely to see just as many businessmen as you do cowboys. The 49-year-old honky tonk features some of the best burgers in Dallas and live music almost every night (usually of the country and western persuasion), and you're more than welcome to join the trove of two-steppers, whether you're wearing designer or dungarees. Bang & Olufsen, Harry Winston, Diane von Furstenberg, Hermes, Stella McCartney, Chanel, and Christian Louboutin are just a few of the high-end shopping options available at this 20,000-square-foot outdoor mall. You might find one of the Ewing boys shopping for a 130,000 rifle at the Beretta Gallery, or a soon-to-be Mrs. Ewing picking out an Oscar de la Renta wedding dress at Warren Barrón Bridal. Summer Travel: Secret hotels of Florida's Gulf Coast Of course, the Ewings would be nothing without the world-renowned Southfork Ranch. The home base of Dallas' most famous TV dynasty actually sits just outside the city, in Parker, Texas. The Ranch is still alive and well, and has served as a tourist destination and an event and conference center since the '80s. Many of Dallas' most elite soirees are held on the property, including the Cattle Baron's Ball, which draws in thousands of guests donning their finest Western attire. This time around the Ewings are spending about as much time around Dallas' South Side as they are around Southfork. Members of the cast and crew stayed in the South Side on Lamar, a loft apartment building that lures creative spirits and young professionals, and provides the city's best views of the Dallas skyline. Many of the scenes were also filmed in South Side, which originally served as the home of the historic Sears, Roebuck & Co.'s Catalog Merchandise Center. Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House Dallas' new stunning, state-of-the-art opera house is the most prestigious venue in the world that warmly welcomes cowboy boots. Eager to promote culture in North Texas, Margot and Bill Winspear donated 42 million with a vision of promoting great opera to help Dallas become a top international city.

Berg village dealt with many traffic casualties because of narrower streets and lanes, While Hill village had wide streets, more traffic signals and a greater number of cyclists. and a hint : Turner et al (2006) derived crash prediction models for this report’s predecessor and found a pronounced ‘safety in numbers’ effect in the models. Using the crash prediction model for mid-block locations, generic motorist and cyclist volumes can be used to demonstrate the impacts on the expected crash rate of varying motor vehicle and cycle volumes. As shown in figure 2.20, an increase in the proportion of cyclists to the overall traffic volume causes an increase in expected crashes at mid-block locations, but the crash rate increases at a decreasing rate. That is to say, the crash rate per cyclist goes down as the cycle volume increases. Please answer this question : Which village is managing traffic more efficiently? A:","output":"Based on the information given, Hill village seems to be managing traffic more efficiently. Here's my justification: 1. Berg village has narrow streets and lanes which can cause more traffic congestion and potentially accidents due to less space for cyclists and motorists to share the road. 2. On the other hand, Hill village has wide streets, more traffic signals and a greater number of cyclists. A greater number of traffic signals may indicate better traffic management and increased safety as they control the traffic flow efficiently. 3. Wide streets provide more room for both cyclists and motorists, reducing the potential for accidents by providing more space for cyclists and motorists to maneuver. 4. According to Turner et al. (2006) 'safety in numbers’ effect found in the models, the crash rate per cyclist goes down as the cycle volume increases. Given that Hill village has a greater number of cyclists, we can infer that the crash rate per cyclist should be lower in Hill village, implying better traffic management. 5. Although an increase in the proportion of cyclists to the overall traffic volume causes an increase in expected crashes at mid-block locations, the rate of increase in crashes is decreasing. Since Hill Village has a higher cycle volume, this indicates the rate of increase of crashes is slower, and thus more manageable, in Hill village compared to Berg village. Therefore, considering all these points, Hill village seems to be dealing with traffic more efficiently and in a safer manner when compared to Berg village."},{"instruction":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: who replaced nikita khrushchev Suggested answer: Hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense, Khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces.

Article: Some good news for online holiday shoppers: bargain-hunting binges will drive prices down as web-based retailers compete to offer bigger discounts, marketing researchers predict. A recent survey by Shopzilla found that nearly 84 percent of online retailers would offer Cyber Monday discounts, up 12 percent from last year. Cyber Monday, the first Monday after Thanksgiving, is the online response to Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving when stores are traditionally flooded with customers, some of whom camp at the entrances overnight to take advantage of discounts. However, in the current economic climate, online retailers have felt pressure to offer sales and discounts even before Black Friday. But how online retailers decide to offer those big savings isn't a simple matter of trying to attract the consumers who are watching their wallets, Bohlmann of Sabanci University in Istanbul says. Online stores will also pay attention to the deals their competitors are offering, potentially leading to price wars between certain retailers to attract all those potential bargain-hunting customers. Online shoppers can be divided into two types, Bohlmann said, --switchers and --loyals. Switchers compare prices between retailers and go for the cheapest one, while loyals stick to one brand or store. It almost doesn't matter what price you charge. Online retailers will look at the percentage of switchers and loyals they have in order to decide whether to offer discounts. The more switchers they have, the more likely they will offer discounts. But retailers don't just look at the percentage of their own customers; they also look at the competition. If one online store has a higher percentage of loyals than the competitor, it can afford to keep prices higher. On the contrary, if it has a higher percentage of switchers than the competitor, it might want to lower prices. Question: It can be inferred from the text that _ - retailers should know more about customers' interest - There will be no shoppers who go out in crowds - Barnes&Noble's prices are lower than other companies' - Retailers like the switchers more than the loyals A:","output":"Retailers should know more about customers' interest."},{"instruction":"There was good news and bad news Thursday at a congressional hearing on the embattled Veterans Affairs health care system. Politicians, health care experts and a VA official agreed solutions exist, but more than three hours of questioning by the House Veterans' Affairs Committee showed that responses so far by Congress and the administration fall short of what's needed. \\"It's going to take wholesale, systematic reform of the entire department,\\" said Republican Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, the committee chairman. \\"It's very clear the status quo is not acceptable and it's time for real change.\\" Dr. Robert Jesse, a top official in the VA health administration, also acknowledged the need for major changes after revelations first reported by CNN of sometimes deadly waits for medical care faced by veterans. \\"We own this\\" \\"We know that we have let veterans down, but we're going to make it right,\\" Jesse told the panel, adding that \\"you all deserve better from us.\\" Declaring that \\"we own this\\" and \\"we're going to fix it,\\" he later said: \\"Today we really need to be looking at the entire structure of the organization to move forward. We really need to examine everything.\\" An internal VA audit released Monday found that tens of thousands of newly returning veterans wait at least 90 days for medical care, while even more who signed up in the VA system over the past 10 years never got an immediate appointment they requested. The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care, and CNN's reporting uncovered the deaths of dozens of others who were waiting for VA care in Phoenix. Despite efforts in recent years to address longstanding problems at the department, including reductions in backlogs for benefits and the number of homeless veterans, the long waits have continued for newly enrolled veterans to get initial appointments for care. Reasons for the chronic problems include the increasing number of veterans returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a bonus system that rewarded managers for meeting goals regarding access to treatment. The VA audit confirmed CNN reports of secret wait lists used to cover up wait times that exceeded department guidelines. The controversy led to the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, while some VA officials have been put on administrative leave pending investigations by the VA inspector general's office and Congress. FBI getting involved. On Wednesday, the FBI said it opened a criminal investigation of the VA in conjunction with the inspector general's probe, which has expanded to 69 facilities. \\"At the department's direction, the FBI has instructed agents in its Phoenix office to conduct an investigation into the allegations related to the VA,\\" a Justice Department spokesman said. \\"Federal prosecutors will be working with these investigators to determine whether there is a basis for criminal charges.\\" Meanwhile, both the House and Senate have passed legislation to permit veterans experiencing long wait times for medical appointments to seek care at non-VA facilities at the government's expense. They now will negotiate a compromise between differences in the two measures. Interim Veterans Affairs Secretary Sloan Gibson, who took over when Shinseki stepped down, also has announced a series of steps in response to the problems. They include a hiring freeze at central headquarters and 21 regional facilities, suspension of all performance awards for senior managers in fiscal year 2014, eliminating an unattainable goal of getting newly enrolled veterans an appointment within 14 days, and ordering an independent outside audit of VA medical care scheduling practices across the system. The VA also has contacted 50,000 veterans waiting for care and will continue reaching out to others, Gibson said after the release of the VA internal audit. Health care audits told the House committee on Thursday that such steps, while welcome, failed to address the underlying need for systemic reforms at the VA to instill a culture of serving the veterans, rather than the bureaucracy. Outside cultural assessment. \\"There is a pervasive VA culture that puts personal gain in the system ahead of veterans. That's wrong,\\" said Tim McClain, president of Humana Government Business. Saying more than \\"band-aids\\" were needed, McClain added that \\"any long-term solution must include a culture and organizational assessment from the outside.\\" Betsy McCaughey, a conservative health care activist known for her opposition to President Barack Obama's health care reforms, complained the Senate legislation included provisions that would undermine the intended goal of letting veterans access civilian medical facilities. McCaughey, the former lieutenant governor of New York, pointed out that veterans would need to prove they had experienced unacceptable waits for VA care, and that any private doctor treating them would have to first call the VA for authorization. Noting the bureaucratic dysfunction at the department, she said: \\"Good luck getting anybody to answer that call.\\" Jesse, the VA's acting under secretary for health, insisted the VA had the capacity to handle the system proposed in the Senate legislation, though he acknowledged that problems occurred at some facilities. The VA legislation was moving quickly through Congress, showing the political sensitivity of the issue in an election year defined by partisan divide. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi signaled Thursday that a final compromise must leave intact the government role of providing health care for veterans instead of privatizing it, as sought by GOP conservatives.

The British film industry is obsessed with the idea of 'broken Britain'. Trainspotting, This is England, Kidulthood, Football Factory, Kes and From London to Brighton. Bullet Boy is just another British movie added to that list. The main character expresses a desire to go straight yet he still insists on hanging around with dead beats who carry guns and fight with gang members over nothing. I was never convinced that he did want to go straight as there was nothing stopping him pursuing an education or a trade. In fact it would have been a breath of fresh air if he had of gone straight and we had a character who turned his life around. Instead he spends his time helping his friend trying to commit murder. I felt no sympathy when he is predictably shot by another teen at the end of the film, which is sad because at the beginning of the film I really liked the entire family and their desire for success. I believe the makers missed a great chance to show the world that success belongs to those who are willing to really strive for it (like the Pursuit of Happiness). I know the purpose of this film was to try and paint a realistic picture of what life is like for black teens living in working class areas of Britain but don't we already have enough films in the UK with that very same plot? Isn't it time these talented producers and writers give Britains youth something to aspire to and show them a better life is just around the corner? I applaud the makers of Bullet Boy for not loading the film full of mindless violence in order to try and get success through shock factors (like Kidulthood, Football Factory) but at the same time this movie offers nothing new to a long list of British films that are effectively dull and depressing to watch.

These pictures were very scary. They showed black boys and men being used as targets for snipers. Snipers are like long-distance shooters who can hit their target from very far away. It's important to know that this is a really bad thing to do. Imagine you are playing with your toys, and someone comes and starts pointing at them with a toy gun, saying they want to shoot them. It would make you feel very scared and sad, right? That's how this woman felt when she saw these pictures. What made her feel even more scared and sad was that one of those black boys in the pictures was her own brother! Can you imagine how you would feel if you saw a picture of someone you love being used as a target? The woman was shocked, and she knew she had to do something about it. So, she decided to tell her story to other people, so they could learn that using pictures of boys and men as sniper targets is not good. It's important to treat everyone with love and kindness, no matter what color their skin is. We should always remember to be kind to each other and to treat every person the same way we would want to be treated. If we all do that, we can help to make the world a better place for everyone. The woman's story teaches us that it's never okay to treat people differently because of the color of their skin. We can all learn from her experience and make sure we show love and kindness to everyone we meet."},{"instruction":"Here is an article: Tom Brady pumps his fist as he leads the Patriots back from a 24-0 deficit. FOXBOROUGH – In a game of mistakes interspersed with guts and resilience, the last mistake lost it. Steven Gostkowski’s 31-yard field goal with 1:56 left in overtime was set up when Ryan Allen’s punt hit the Broncos’ Tony Carter at the Denver 13 and the Patriots had a 34-31 win. It was a wild game, a see-saw game and if we’re lucky, the Super Bowl will be this as exciting. It certainly could be as cold. “A lot of guys were heroes today,” said Bill Belichick, whose gutsy call to take the 20 mph wind and not the ball in overtime turned out to be the right one. It’s just a shame that the 14th meeting between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning had to end off a final turnover, sending the Broncos to 9-2 and the Patriots to 8-3. Certainly the Broncos’ Knowshon Moreno deserved better after a career night that saw him carry 37 times for 224 yards. He limped off the field with an ankle injury in overtime and was spotted in the locker room on crutches with his right ankle in a boot. Denver ran for 280 yards in all. Usually that’s enough to win a game, especially when the wind chill is dipping to zero degrees by the end of the night. But the Patriots, who always seem to find a way to win at home, rallied behind a shell-shocked-turned splendid Brady in the second half, their momentum rising in waves. He finished 34-50-344 with three TDs and zero INTs, rallying the Patriots from a 24-0 halftime deficit, the largest for any Pats team under Bill Belichick. Manning, who fell to 4-10 against his future Hall of Fame counterpart, really couldn’t answer back, except on the drive that began with 7:37 left and tied the game in regulation. “The game plan was to move the ball and score points,” he said, explaining a quiet night in which he threw for just 150 yards on 19-of-36. “We were moving the ball running the ball and Knowshon was hot. We were riding him.” Manning threw for two TDs but his one interception proved costly as it set up the third New England touchdown. The Patriots fumbled six times and lost three, all in the first 8:00 leading to 17 Denver points. The Broncos fumbled five times and lost three, the last one being decisive. PHOTOS: NFL WEEK 12: GIANTS FREEZE IN CLUTCH, PANTHERS WIN 7TH STRAIGHT “They’ve got a good offense. Tom’s a great quarterback,” Manning said. “We helped them with some short fields but give them credit they made the plays in the second half and we didn’t.” The Patriots didn’t look as though they belonged on the same field as the Broncos and many of their frozen fans took the opportunity to beat the traffic and go home. They were getting beat up on both sides of the line of scrimmage. The Broncos’ defense was swarming and they seemed to have no response. But it was if a switch had been thrown at halftime. The Patriots turned into the aggressors. Brady started getting time to throw. Manning started getting rushed. And the momentum swung to the home team. “You can pile all the disappointment on however you want to,” said Manning, who moved had two good drives in OT but couldn’t get the Broncos into field goal range. “We’re just thinking about his loss right now. ... I hated the way that ended and not getting a chance to get our hands on the ball.” “People don’t get credit for playing good halves,” said Broncos safety Duke Ihenacho. “Nobody cares at the end of day. We’ve just to learn from it and move on to Kansas City.” Showdown II will be a little different than the first matchup last week where the Broncos knocked the Chiefs from the unbeaten ranks. The Chiefs were stunned by the Chargers earlier in the day and, even at 9-2, both teams will enter the game with doubts, although the winner will likely go on to take the AFC West. Meanwhile, Sunday’s night’s game raised questions about the Broncos’ vulnerability – especially if Moreno is out for a long period of time – and Manning’s effectiveness in cold weather. They’ll have little margin for error in their last five games because the Pats moved to 8-3 with two of those losses ending in controversy. New England’s resiliency was on full display Sunday night and, with a three-game lead over the Jets and Dolphins in the AFC East, it will play the remainder of the season hunting home field advantage. “One minute, we were down 24-0,” Aqib Talib said. “The next minute, we were kicking the game-winning field goal.” Typical Patriots? The decisive play was a case in point, just a little special teams play that may have changed the season. Maybe it was a little karma payback. The Broncos had moved the ball better in overtime and Manning was looking forward to getting the ball back. Rookie punter Ryan Allen sent one high into the frigid sky. Ex-Pat Wes Welker back to receive, starting waving his players off. But the ball took a strange bounce and hopped off another ex-Pat, Tony Carter. Nate Ebner recovered. “I was just doing what I’m supposed to do in that situation. Your instincts take over. I don’t want to make too much out of it,” Ebner said. “I was just covering down on the punts like I always do. The punt returner was waving it off. Marquice Cole made a great play, pushing his guy into the ball and I was just watching. Ryan has been putting up some great punts, so it really goes to them. Just seeing the returner waving at it and then (Cole) pushing him in there. Just right place at the right time.” That’s often the Patriots’ way, isn’t it? Write a title for it.","output":"Tom Brady and the Patriots make an amazing comeback to win a thrilling game against the Broncos"},{"instruction":"Palestinians Head to Paris to Probe Arafat's Death (Reuters) Reuters - Palestinian leaders plan tosend a delegation to Paris to seek details on what caused thedeath of President Yasser Arafat last week at a Frenchhospital, officials said on Wednesday.

Article: An astronaut's work may sound exciting, but living in space isn't as fun as you think. The website www.space.com lists the disadvantages of living in space. Here are some of them. When astronauts work outside the station during spacewalks, they have to wear special gloves. The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness. Astronauts sometimes have to spend weeks and even months away from Earth. They miss their friends and families. Question: What's the hardest part of life for astronauts in space? - They feel very lonely. - They have to stay alone in space. - They have no friends. - They have no families. Answer:","output":"The hardest part of life for astronauts in space is the feeling of loneliness. This is because they have to spend weeks and even months away from Earth, which means they miss their friends and families during this time. The isolation and distance from their loved ones can make coping with the challenges of living in space even more difficult. While astronauts are trained to handle the various physical and mental demands of their job, the emotional aspect of being separated from their support networks on Earth can be particularly challenging."},{"instruction":"Aleksandr Lurija Which language is this?","output":"The name Aleksandr Lurija appears to be in Russian.

Dean and Knapp record that in early 1707 Keiser surrendered the lease of the Gänsemarkt to Johann Heinrich Sauerbrey, who thus became responsible for the staging of the double opera. It may by this time have been in rehearsal, and the difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements. The consensus among experts is that the two parts were first performed on consecutive evenings in January 1708, as they are the first works in Mattheson's opera list for 1708. There are no surviving records of the public's reception, the length of the original run, or of any revivals. Whether Handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain; he may have returned from Italy, fresh from the opening of Rodrigo in Florence, to supervise the production of Florindo and Daphne in Hamburg. Dean and Knapp suggest the works may have been directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner, although Anthony Hicks in his Grove Handel biography, says that so unusual a project would not have been attempted without the composer's presence.The theatre's management was clearly concerned that the public might find the double opera too heavy in undiluted form. Accordingly, a comic intermezzo in Low German dialect (platte-deutsch) was devised by Sauerbrey to precede the performance of Daphne. The critic and essayist Romain Rolland, in his life of Handel, termed this a \\"mutilation\\", carried out \\"for fear that the music may tire the hearers\\".

They wanted to gain more land and power. After WWI, they didn't get as much as they wanted, so they became unhappy. Before World War II, Japan and Italy became friends with Germany because they all wanted to become more powerful together. At this time, Germany, Italy, and Japan formed the Axis Powers.

They still joined the Axis Powers because they thought it would make them stronger. To answer if the questions are paraphrases of each other: No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other.

Sentiment analysis refers to the process of determining the tone or emotion behind a particular piece of text by examining the words and phrases used in the text. The sentiment could be positive, negative, or neutral, depending on the context and language used. In this case, the sentence \\"does a good job\\" implies that someone has performed an action or carried out a task effectively, resulting in a favorable outcome. The word \\"good\\" is an adjective with a positive connotation, suggesting that the job was done well. Thus, this phrase conveys a feeling of praise, recognition, or appreciation towards the person who completed the task. Several factors contribute to the identification of sentiment in textual data. The primary factor is the words and phrases used and their contextual meaning. Here, both \\"good\\" and \\"job\\" contribute to the sentiment, although \\"good\\" plays a more significant role. Additionally, punctuation, capitalization, and emojis can play a role in expressing sentiment, though there are none present in this example. It's also essential to recognize that sentiment analysis may sometimes rely on the larger context in which the phrase or sentence is situated. However, in this standalone example, the sentence \\"does a good job\\" has an unmistakably positive sentiment."},{"instruction":"Facts: - caps: 29 44 69 8 12 41 19 7 40 35 49 5 6 168 108 21 43 30 8 - nationalyears: 1993 - youthclubs: norwich city - birth date: 28 august 1975 - clubs: norwich rovers -lrb- loan -rrb- bristol rovers reading busan i \` city park queens park rangers swindon town → colchester united -lrb- → loan -rrb- colchester united norwich city → barnsley -lrb- loan bournemouth -rrb- → shrewsbury town -lrb- loan -rrb- exeter city leyton -lrb- orient → exeter city -lrb- loan -rrb- exeter city cheltenham loan town dagenham & redbridge -rrb- → bristol - nationalcaps: 3 - currentclub: dagenham & redbridge - caption: cureton playing for cheltenham town in 2014 - height: 1.73 - nationalgoals: 0 - name: jamie cureton - nationalteam: england u18 - birth place: bristol , england - position: striker - fullname: jamie cureton - years: 000 -- 2000 2000 -- 2003 2003 -- 2004 2004 -- ? 2005 2005 -- 2006 2005 -- 2006 2006 -- 2007 -- 2007 -- 2010 2008 -- 2009 2010 2010 -- 2011 1993 2011 -- 2012 2012 2012 -- 2013 2013 -- 2014 1995 2014 -- -- 1996 1996 1996 - clubnumber: 7 - youthyears: 000 ? -- 1993 - image: jamie cureton 08-02-2014 1.jpg - goals: 6 23 16 2 0 17 1 1 21 11 20 0 4 68 50 4 6 7 4 Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of jamie cureton .

When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt. Question: The author will most likely === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"interview realtors. The author emphasizes the importance of interviewing real estate agents before hiring one, regardless of whether they are recommended by friends or family or even if they have previously worked with them. By interviewing prospective agents, the author believes it is a crucial step in ensuring a thorough understanding of how they handle their business, as well as assessing whether they are up to the task of representing the client in the best possible way. This approach aligns with the author's belief in treating the process of hiring a real estate agent as a business decision rather than just accepting a recommendation or simply going with a previous agent out of convenience or personal connections."},{"instruction":"I have received the list of CES agreements which George put together as having Texas delivery points and have been attempting to put together a back to back agreement similar to the back to back agreement which ENA has with CES; however, I keep running into confidentially agreement problems.

It was probably our first form of self-expression when we were babies: long before we start writing, we're painting and scribbling , both in order to make sense of the world and because we enjoy it. In the history of human culture, too, painting and image making came before writing or even simple mathematics: 30,000 years ago compared to 5,000. Yet after we leave school most of us never pick up a pencil again--willingly. If asked to draw something, most adults and many older children will shake their heads and say, \\" Not me! I can't draw. I'm hopeless at it.\\" When you think about it, this is very strange. Drawing involves coordinating the hand and the eye with the pencil. It's a basic skill, no more difficult to learn than other amazing things that humans do, such as hitting a tennis ball over the net or writing our own name. there's no special talent involved. Anybody who can learn to write can learn to draw. So, there you are - no excuse not to get out your pencil, pencil sharpener and rubber and take part in the Big Draw, a nationwide series of free art events taking place all over Britain next October.

This clandestine organization, responsible for numerous acts of terror and political violence, has been the subject of a massive manhunt for years, with many of its members having disappeared without a trace. The police finally scored a significant victory in their relentless pursuit of bringing the group to justice. This breakthrough in counter-terrorism efforts will likely serve as a catalyst for further investigations and eventual dismantling of the clandestine organization. Background: The Red Brigades, or Brigate Rosse in Italian, emerged in the 1970s as a left-wing paramilitary organization committed to social and political change. The group, primarily made up of disillusioned students, factory workers, and intellectuals, acted in response to growing economic and social disparities in the country. The organization resorted to violent means to voice their dissent, aiming to clear the path for a Marxist revolution. The height of their activities between 1970 to the mid-'80s, referred to as \\"Years of Lead,\\" saw the group carry out kidnappings, bombings, and assassinations targeting Italy's political and economic elites. Among their most high-profile acts was the abduction and assassination of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro in 1978. Despite severe crackdowns throughout the 1980s and '90s, the Red Brigades remained active, with some of their members having assumed distinct low-profile lives. The discovery of the alleged hideout has piqued intrigue and raised questions over the extent of the group's current activities. Police Raid and Discoveries: In a strategic operation, law enforcement authorities stormed the nondescript building, located in an otherwise peaceful neighborhood. The residence, according to police sources, served as a hidden base for the Red Brigades' members. Upon raiding the property, the officers uncovered an incriminating stockpile of weapons, explosives, and other resources, including materials for forging documents. Apart from the trove of physical evidence, police found several documents revealing intelligence on the organization's membership, operations, and potential targets. The discovery of the Red Brigades' covert network has provided authorities with invaluable insights into the extremist group's strategies and will likely help in tracking down any remaining members. Impact on Counter-Terrorism Efforts: The unearthing of the alleged Red Brigades hideout marks a pivotal moment in Italy's counter-terrorism efforts. The operation demonstrates the continued vigilance of law enforcement authorities and their commitment to thwarting any potential resurgence of outdated, extremist ideologies that have been responsible for causing so much unrest in the past. By achieving this breakthrough, the Italian security forces have shown that they are capable of adapting to unconventional tactics employed by such terrorist organizations. Additionally, the discovery of the hideout and the intel it provides can help facilitate international cooperation in fighting against terrorism. Conclusion: The surprising discovery of the alleged Red Brigades hideout has reignited concerns about the group's potential activities and acts as a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by these organizations. Nevertheless, this successful operation underscores law enforcement's continued vigilance and provides a much-needed boost to Italy's counter-terrorism strategies. As authorities continue to identify and apprehend members of this clandestine organization, they will be instrumental in reinforcing security and facilitating peace and stability not only in Italy, but across the global stage."},{"instruction":"News article: Bruce Springsteen shows up to support showjumper daughter Jessica in the Nations Cup Veteran crooner showed up at The RDS in Dublin to cheer on 24-year-old as she starred for Team USA THE BOSS was back in Dublin this week, scene of some of his biggest gigs – but without his guitar.

Article:","output":"Title: Philippines Imposes Temporary Ban on Workers Travelling to Qatar Amid Diplomatic Crisis Introduction: The Philippines has imposed a temporary ban on its workers travelling to Qatar, as several Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt, broke off diplomatic ties with the Gulf state. The decision has left thousands of Filipino workers in limbo and raised concerns about their employment and safety in the region. Background: Over two million Filipinos work abroad, primarily in the Middle East, where they are employed in various sectors including domestic work, construction, and retail. The Philippines heavily relies on the remittances sent by these Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) to support their families and contribute to the national economy. In Qatar, there are approximately 140,000 Filipinos working, making it the fourth most popular Middle Eastern destination for OFWs. Reason for the Ban: The decision to impose a temporary ban on worker travel to Qatar has come amid a diplomatic crisis. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have severed ties with Qatar, accusing the nation of supporting Islamist terrorism and destabilizing the region. While Qatar has denied these allegations, the situation has led to travel restrictions, forcing some airlines to cancel flights and suspending of Doha's only land border with Saudi Arabia. Implications for Filipino Workers: The travel ban imposed by the Philippines has raised concerns about the wellbeing and future of Filipino workers in Qatar, as well as those planning to travel to the country for work. The government's primary concern is the safety and security of OFWs. However, the travel restrictions are likely to disrupt the lives of thousands of Filipinos, possibly affecting their employment status and financial security. Government Response: The Philippine government has stated that they are closely monitoring the situation in Qatar and the wider Gulf region. The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) has established an OFW help desk to provide assistance and information to those affected by the crisis. Additionally, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) is coordinating with the Philippine embassies and consulates in the region to ensure that emergency assistance is available to OFWs affected by the situation. Conclusion: The temporary ban on Filipino workers travelling to Qatar is a response to the escalating diplomatic crisis in the Gulf region. The Philippines government has taken this step to protect its citizens, while also expressing concern for the wellbeing and safety of the thousands of OFWs in Qatar. As the situation unfolds, the Philippine government is closely monitoring developments and is prepared to provide support and assistance to its nationals affected by the crisis in the region."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: What is common in two eukaryotic proteins? A:","output":"Given the paragraph does not provide any information about specific eukaryotic proteins, a detailed answer can only be provided by considering the general characteristics that are common in eukaryotic proteins. Eukaryotic proteins share several common features and properties due to their origins within eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells are complex and their proteins play a significant role in ensuring proper cellular function and regulation. Here are some common features of eukaryotic proteins: 1. Structure: Eukaryotic proteins often have intricate structures composed of one or more polypeptide chains. These chains combine to form a complex three-dimensional shape necessary for their function. Amino acids are the basic building blocks of these protein structures, arranged in a specific sequence to create a unique functionality. 2. Synthesis: In eukaryotic cells, proteins are synthesized by ribosomes, cellular complexes composed of proteins and RNA molecules. Ribosomes translate messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, which are generated from DNA in the cell nucleus, into polypeptide chains with the help of transfer RNA (tRNA). This process is known as protein synthesis and follows a similar pathway in all eukaryotic cells. 3. Post-translational modifications: After synthesis, many eukaryotic proteins undergo a series of chemical modifications, known as post-translational modifications (PTMs), which can include phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, and other processes. These modifications play an essential role in controlling protein function, stability, and localization within the cell. 4. Subcellular localization: Eukaryotic proteins can be found in various subcellular compartments, such as the nucleus, cytoplasm, membrane, and other organelles. Subcellular localization often plays a key role in protein function and regulation. 5. Protein-protein interactions: Eukaryotic proteins often interact with other proteins to carry out a specific function as part of a larger molecular complex. These protein-protein interactions are critical to many cellular processes, including signal transduction, gene expression regulation, and metabolic pathways. 6. Regulation: Eukaryotic proteins are tightly regulated to maintain cellular homeostasis and respond to changing environmental conditions. Regulation can occur at various levels, including the synthesis, degradation, modification, and subcellular localization of the protein. Regulatory mechanisms include the actions of specific enzymes, molecular chaperones, and other protein-binding partners that modulate protein behavior. 7. Evolutionary conservation: Many eukaryotic proteins share conserved amino acid sequences and structural features with other proteins across species. This evolutionary conservation suggests that these proteins play essential roles in maintaining cellular functions throughout the eukaryotic lineage. In conclusion, eukaryotic proteins share numerous common characteristics, including their structure, synthesis, post-translational modifications, subcellular localization, protein-protein interactions, regulation, and evolutionary conservation. These features allow eukaryotic proteins to play the diverse and intricate roles required for the proper functioning of eukaryotic cells."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: Slim said, \\"That's no secret.

Context: Since grade school we have known about the food pyramid, but the food pyramid I want to discuss today is quite different: The Mediterranean Food Pyramid. The pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously. The pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed. The pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region. One of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways. They are among the minority of the world’s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic. There are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) – plus a little red wine. Your fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily. Fish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals. Fruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily. Question: What issue is the author trying to address by promoting the Mediterranean diet? Options: A.

Does it follow that \\"Please do not touch the copier in the office as well.\\"?","output":"The statement \\"I expect your wire's at the office unopened\\" suggests that there is an unopened communication or package at the office, presumably containing a wire or some other important item. It doesn't explicitly indicate any instructions about the copier in the office. However, the follow-up statement \\"Please do not touch the copier in the office as well\\" is a separate instruction that requests not to touch or use the copier located in the office. While these two statements could be related in terms of maintaining a certain protocol or organization within the office environment, they do not have a direct cause-and-effect relationship. It is possible that the person who sent the wire wants to ensure that specific office equipment, like the copier, remains undisturbed to prevent any potential disruptions, damage, or even security breaches. This might be the case, for example, if the wire or other material in the communication is sensitive or fragile, or if the copier has a history of malfunctioning or causing issues. Alternatively, the request to leave the copier untouched could be due to ongoing maintenance or repairs. In that case, using the copier might interfere with the technician's work or could exacerbate existing issues. Given both of these statements, the recipient of the communication should: 1. Retrieve the unopened wire at the office, ensuring that the communication or package remains undisturbed until they have a chance to open and review the contents. 2. Abide by the request not to touch the copier within the office. This may be to protect the equipment from potential damage, to ensure that the space remains in order, or to maintain the security of sensitive information. 3. Follow any additional instructions or requests that may have been communicated in the rest of the message or from the sender. There might be more information, clarification or further instructions available that will provide context about the relationship between the unopened wire and the copier, but based on the statements given, there is no explicit connection between the two. In summary, while these two instructions do not have a direct cause-and-effect relationship, it is essential for the recipient to abide by both requests. This will help maintain the proper functioning and organization of the office environment, as well as safeguard any sensitive information potentially contained within the unopened wire communication."},{"instruction":"An eight-year-old boy has left doctors baffled after his hands swelled to giant proportions and now weigh more than two stone. Young Kaleem, from India, is unable to carry out simple tasks, including tying his own shoe laces, after he was born with hands twice the size of an average baby. His mother Haleema, 27, said she knew he was different at birth but was powerless to help and the youngster's hands have now grown so large they measure 13 inches from the base of his palm to the end of his middle finger. Scroll down for video. Kaleem, from India, was born with hands twice the size of an average baby and they have continued to grow. His hands now measure 13 inches from the base of his palm to the tip of his middle finger and weigh two stone. The eight-year-old claims he is bullied because of his giant hands and has difficulty performing simple tasks. The cricket fan said he has been bullied and shunned most of his life because others are 'scared' of his deformity. He said: 'I do not go to school because the teacher says other kids are scared of my hands. 'Many of them used to bully me for my deformity. They would say \\"let's beat up the kid with the large hands\\". 'Some of them have actually beaten me and would go after me often. 'I find it difficult to put on my clothes, button my shirt and pull up my pants. 'But I don't know if I want doctors to operate on my hands. They would have to make me unconscious and then they would cut me open. 'I have no problem if they could do it without an injection. A small operation would be okay.' His parents, who earn just £15 a month, have been desperately trying to find help for their son - but to no avail. His mother Haleema, 27, (pictured with Kaleem and another one of her children) said she feels 'powerless' Kaleem, a keen cricketer, said the teachers at his school have told him other children are 'scared' of his hands. He has found it difficulty to play cricket and hold a bat due to his condition but tries to still join in with his friends. His mother, who has other children who do not suffer from the same condition, said: 'When Kaleem was born his hand was twice the size of a normal baby's. 'His hands were big and his fingers were long. Initially his fists were small but they began to grow large as well and his fingers also kept growing.' His father, Shamim, 45, who works as a labourer, is worried his son will never be independent and blames himself for not earning enough money. 'He has difficulty feeding himself because his fist does not bend properly - so we have to feed him,' he said. 'Using two fingers he is able to pick up some things like a glass of water to drink. 'We want to take him to the hospital but there have been times when money has been so low that my wife has been forced to go begging. 'In that kind of financial situation, getting treatment for Kaleem was difficult. 'Even when I tried to get Kaleem into the school, the headmaster told me to put in writing that the school would not be responsible if the other children were afraid of his hands or bullied him or laughed at him.' Doctors in India have been left baffled by his growing hands and many are at a loss as to what the condition is. The youngster has difficulty eating, tying his shoelaces and carrying out other basic tasks due to his hands. Kaleem's father Shamim, 45, (pictured together above) is worried his son will never become independent. The couple have only just been able to take their son to a local doctor for an assessment but their hopes of an instant cure have been dashed. Dr Ratan, the director of the local hospital, said: 'As far as my knowledge goes, this is an extremely rare condition. 'I have not seen a case in medical journals or on the internet where only the hands grew to such a large size. 'Until we have done proper genetic testing we will not be able to say exactly what is causing this deformity.' He said that apart from the unsightly growths, Kaleem is in good health - with properly functioning lungs and heart. Doctors have assessed Kaleem and have described his hands as a 'rare condition'. He is otherwise healthy. Kaleem was born with larger-than-average hands but they have continued to grow throughout his childhood. But as his hands continue to grow it may put increased pressure on his cardiovascular system, potentially shortening his life. Elsewhere, Dr Krishan Chugh, head of paediatrics at the state-of-the-art Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurgaon, near Delhi, has also been left baffled after reviewing photographs and videos of the boy's hands. However, he believes Kaleem may be suffering from either lymphangioma or hamartoma - which are both treatable. He added: 'This condition looks very rare and I have come across something like this before. Without proper examination and medical tests I am not 100 per cent sure about what this is.' Kaleem's parents are now hoping to raise money for their son in the hope that his condition can be treated. One doctor said he believes the Kaleem may be suffering from either lymphangioma - a condition of the lymphatic system causing extreme inflamation - or hamartoma - a benign tumour - both of which are treatable. Lymphangioma is a condition of the lymphatic system which causes extreme inflammation resulting in doughy masses forming in certain parts of the body. Hamartoma is a benign type of tumour where the body produces excess tissue. After hearing from the doctors, Kaleem's parents now have renewed optimism that something can be done for their son and are doubling their efforts to raise money for him. 'We have tried several places with no solutions so far,' said Shamim. 'But I have a feeling there is a way to get the resources to give my son a normal life.'

The phrase \\"ran high from the outset\\" is idiomatically translated as \\"olivat kireät alusta alkaen\\", in direct English translation it means \\"were tense from the start\\". The phrase \\"Emotions on the draft directive\\" is translated as \\"Tunteet luonnosdirektiiviä kohtaan\\" which directly translates to \\"Emotions towards the draft directive\\". Like in any translation, sentence structure and idiomatic expressions do not always translate directly from one language to another. In this case, the phrase \\"ran high from the outset\\" needed to be translated in a more contextual, idiomatic way to maintain its meaning in Finnish. The same applies to \\"Emotions on\\", which translated would look strange in Finnish if taken literally, and thus it is translated in a form that is common in Finnish language to express the same meaning. Translating complex sentences like this one also involves understanding the semantic features of Finnish language structure and culture. The subject of the sentence, the 'draft directive', was kept as the object in the Finnish sentence to keep the translation consistent with the original text. Finnish, like English, is a subject-verb-object language, which means that the structure of the sentence is generally the same in both languages. This also helped in translating the sentence to Finnish. In conclusion, the translation of \\"Emotions on the draft directive ran high from the outset.\\" to Finnish as \\"Tunteet luonnosdirektiiviä kohtaan olivat kireät alusta alkaen\\" maintains the original meaning and sentiment of the sentence while adjusting to the semantic and structural features of the Finnish language."},{"instruction":"The most recent booking for this hotel was made on 19 Jul at 1052 from France Add punctuation.","output":"The most recent booking for this hotel was made on 19th July at 10:52, from France."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: A Loyal Character Dancer, language, English language; English language, spokenIn, Great Britain; A Loyal Character Dancer, publisher, Soho Press; Soho Press, country, United States; United States, ethnicGroup, Asian Americans","output":"In the United States, Soho Press published \\"A Loyal Character Dancer,\\" an English language novel featuring Asian Americans, predominantly spoken in Great Britain."},{"instruction":"Title: Sometimes nothing else will do.....

The sounds of children's voices die out, followed by a flash-forward to Los Angeles in 2029 AD. The world has become a wasteland of wrecked cars, destroyed buildings, and black-charred playgrounds filled with skeletons and skulls.

Flying aircraft search the ground for targets as T-800 androids sweep the terrain at places the tanks cannot access. Although they suffer heavy losses, the humans manage to destroy several tanks, aircraft and androids.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Candy Movie plot: Candy (Abbie Cornish) is a beautiful young lady with a lot of potential who falls in love with a charming, young, aspiring poet (Heath Ledger) and his beatnik lifestyle- which includes drugs. Before too long, both of them are wrapped up in the druggie lifestyle. What starts off as harmless fun and pleasure ends up as pain and misery. Heath Ledger is the poet, Dan is a pretty good con man and works a nice credit card scheme that keeps the cash coming in at a steady rate- for awhile. Then, of course, their luck runs out and it comes down to lying, stealing and manipulating Candy's family for money. Soon, as Dan and Candy sink further and further into a horrific heroin addiction; it comes down to prostitution, degradation and then withdrawal. This is ultimately a very sad story with a bittersweet ending. Dan's devotion to Candy is shown when the two suffer through horrible heroin withdrawal only to decide that they cannot quit the drug cold turkey and turn to methadone. Dan moves them to the country and takes on some menial labor jobs for money to put food on the table. Candy doesn't work and soon becomes more and more depressed and lonely; hanging out and smoking pot with a neighbor. Her behavior becomes more and more erratic and before long she flees the country. It's a heartbreaking scene, when Dan comes home from a hard day of work to find the place trashed and Candy gone, words written in lipstick on the walls. He falls apart. He's despondent and turns back to drugs. He goes to see his mentor and father figure, Casper (Geoffrey Rush), who has developed a drug more potent and cheaper than heroin; but when he arrives there he finds his friend has overdosed. This is a powerful moment in the film and this is where Ledger is at his best, quietly conveying his complete emotional devastation. He's lost the girl he loves and his best friend. He's hit rock bottom. He gets a dishwashing job and manages to stay clean; still thinking about Candy and still writing his poetry on breaks. Eventually the day comes when a... My question: Who does Candy become involved with, the leads to a relapse to her previous lifestyle? The answer to this question is:","output":"Candy becomes involved with a neighbor while living in the country with Dan. As she becomes more depressed and lonely, she starts hanging out with this neighbor, who introduces her to smoking pot, which eventually leads to her relapse into her previous drug-addicted lifestyle. This involvement with the neighbor has a profound impact on Candy and contributes to the deterioration of her relationship with Dan. Her behavior becomes increasingly erratic, and ultimately, she decides to leave Dan and flees the country. This new involvement not only triggers Candy's relapse to drug addiction but also adds an extra layer of emotional turmoil and heartache to the story. As Candy continues on a downward spiral, Dan tries his best to cope with the loss of Candy and attempts to rebuild his life. However, the impact of Candy's choices and actions on Dan are evident, as he eventually turns back to drugs in his sadness and desperation. This tragic turn of events highlights the devastating effects that addiction can have on relationships, and how the choices of one individual, like Candy's involvement with the neighbor, can lead to dire consequences for both partners. The relapse into addiction and the breakdown of their relationship make for a powerful and emotionally charged story, reflecting on the complex dynamics of love, addiction, and personal struggles."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: The Scottish government had hoped to unite all of Holyrood's parties behind a call to \\"fully protect\\" Scotland's place in the single market. However, after a chamber debate on the issue, Labour abstained and Tories and Lib Dems voted against the SNP motion. Economy Secretary Keith Brown said the EU was a \\"vital\\" market for Scotland. He had hoped for all parties to \\"show consensus\\" in backing single market membership and \\"unanimously\\" lobby the UK government, but in the end SNP members were backed only by Green MSPs. Holyrood's Europe committee has called for single market access to be a key priority in the Brexit talks, although the UK government has refused to give a \\"running commentary\\" on its negotiating position. Mr Brown's motion for the debate called for parliament to recognise the \\"overwhelming vote\\" in Scotland to remain in the EU, before calling for \\"Scotland's place in the single market to be fully protected\\". He said the single market had provided considerable benefits for Scotland, noting that leaving could cause job losses and increase the cost of exports. The cabinet secretary also said the UK government did not have a mandate to take the country out of the single market, only the European Union. Opposition parties submitted amendments to this motion underlining priorities of their own. The Scottish Conservatives called attention to the vote of the UK as a whole to leave the EU, asking parliament to \\"support the UK government in its efforts to secure a positive trading relationship with the EU\\". Tory MSP Murdo Fraser pointed out that this was Holyrood's 11th Brexit debate, asking if the SNP was scheduling so many similar debates to distract attention from its \\"failing domestic agenda\\". He added that Scotland's exports to the rest of the UK are four times the level of exports to the EU, noting that \\"access to the UK single market should not be at risk\\". This position was echoed by Labour's Jackie Baillie, who submitted an amendment saying parliament should \\"recognise the importance of Scotland's place in the UK single market\\". Referring to the figure cited by Mr Fraser, she said \\"tearing Scotland out of the UK\\" would be \\"an act of economic vandalism at least four times greater than Brexit\\". She said it was \\"vital\\" to get the best deal for Scotland, but said it was more realistic to aim for access to the single market rather than full membership. The Scottish Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, put forward an amendment calling for a referendum on the final terms of the deal negotiated between the UK government and the EU. Leader Willie Rennie said MSPs should recognise that \\"voting for a departure is not the same as voting for a destination\\", accusing the Conservative UK government of seeking a \\"blank cheque Brexit\\" by pursuing exit from the EU at all costs. Scottish government Brexit minister Mike Russell said opposition parties had an \\"obsession with independence\\", saying their positions had \\"absolutely nothing to do with Europe\\". In the final votes each of the amendments was rejected in turn, winning support only from the parties putting them forward. Mr Brown's motion then passed by 65 votes to 32, with 20 abstentions.","output":"The Scottish National Party (SNP) has failed in its bid to unite Holyrood’s parties in a call to guarantee Scotland’s place in the single market.

Moray also raised money in London by selling items from the Scottish crown jewels, including what was claimed to be a unicorn horn. Queen Elizabeth and her advisors were at first reluctant to intervene but their actions, and support of Moray, served to prevent reconciliation in Scotland. The Regent Moray was assassinated in January 1570 by a member of the Hamilton family. Elizabeth sent an army into Scotland in May 1570, which reached Glasgow, where the Queen's party were besieging Glasgow Castle. The army was commanded by the Earl of Sussex from Berwick, its leader in Scotland was William Drury, styled \\"Captain General.\\" The Earl of Lennox was in their company, arriving at Edinburgh on 14 May 1570. The Marian lords abandoned their siege of Glasgow Castle before the English arrived on 18 May, and returned to their homelands, the Hamiltons to Arran and Craignethan Castle, and Drury attempted a siege of Dumbarton Castle. For Elizabeth's foreign policy this intervention had the effect of making France and Spain less likely to offer tangible pro-Marian support. After the Rising of the North and the discovery of the Ridolfi plot which further damaged Mary's reputation, Regent Mar and James Douglas, Earl of Morton were able to broker the deployment of an English army against Mary's supporters at Edinburgh Castle. The English diplomat Henry Killigrew worked on the reconciliation of the Scottish nobility at Perth in February 1572, where many promised not to support Mary as Queen. The fall of Edinburgh Castle concluded the civil war. What happened second: Regent Moray was assassinated or Marian lords abandoned Glasgow Castle?","output":"The second event that occurred was the assassination of Regent Moray in January 1570. The Marian lords abandoned Glasgow Castle later when the English army arrived on 18 May 1570. Before the English arrival, Queen Elizabeth had sent an army into Scotland in May 1570, which reached Glasgow where the Queen's party was besieging Glasgow Castle. The Marian lords then left the siege and returned to their homelands."},{"instruction":"Mary Cerruti was reported missing in 2015 after neighbors contacted police because they hadn't seen her for a while and her mail was piling up. HOUSTON — There are still no answers in a bizarre Heights mystery that has the whole neighborhood talking. Renters were moving into the bungalow at 610 Allston Saturday when they found human remains in an attic wall. They also found a pair of red eyeglasses similar to those worn by the previous owner, 61-year-old Mary Cerruti, the Houston Chronicle reported. \\"That's terrifying and so sad. It's scary that we were right there. And we didn't know,\\" said April Lidell, a neighbor. \\"It’s either an accident, an unfortunate accident, or somebody put her there.\\" The homeowners found the skeletal remains inside a wall in their new home on Saturday. (Photo: KHOU 11 News) Cerruti was reported missing two years ago after neighbors contacted police because they hadn't seen her for a while and her mail was piling up. \\"I passed by there every day and I saw everything piling up,\\" said Abbie Rangel. \\"For the longest time, I just thought she went out of town.\\" Lidell lived across the street in 2015 when firefighters went inside Cerruti’s house and found a bunch of dead cats. “When the fire trucks were there, they said the smell was so bad in the house,” Lidell remembered. “They figured it was from the cats, because God knows how long they had been in there without food or water.” There was no sign of the woman described by neighbors as shy, quiet and frail. “I don’t know what more we could have done, but I wish we had,” Lidell said. “Wish we had talked to her more. I wish we would have said, ‘Hey here’s our numbers if you need anything, give us a call.’” Neighbors say Cerruti's car remained in the driveway for a about a year after she disappeared but one day, it was gone. Neighbors say Cerruti joined them in the fight against a luxury apartment complex planned for the land around her house. She spoke at a 2013 planning commission meeting. \\"Literally this project is going to be in my backyard,\\" Cerruti said. \\"I'm surrounded. And I just don't see the sense of this project. It seems like just too many apartments for such a small space.\\" But the project was approved and Cerruti, a divorcee who lived alone, had to contend with construction that made getting to her house more difficult. Neighbors say she rarely came out after that. A bank foreclosed on her home in 2015 after the mortgage payments stopped. Liens on the property were settled, the house was cleaned out and it was eventually placed on the market and sold. Police Detective Jason Fay said the new residents are now a bit worried because of the body. \\"Was it someone who was killed and stuffed in the wall, or did they accidentally pass away by ending up in the wall?\\" Fay said. The renters say they're not sure if they're going to stay in the house. A medical examiner is still working to identify the remains and determine if there was any foul play.

Patric Schneider/For The Chronicle Bones found in wall of Heights home of woman who disappeared in 2015 1 / 7 Back to Gallery No one knew what happened to 61-year-old Mary Cerruti. The lawn of her west Heights bungalow grew wild. A window broke. Mail piled up. The signs of her disappearance troubled neighbors, who had rallied behind her as a hold-out against a massive new apartment complex that had gobbled up much of the surrounding property. They contacted police in 2015. One neighbor hired a private investigator. As theories swirled about her fate, a bank that fall was cleared to foreclose on her home. Police issued a missing person's report three days later. Neighbors noticed when the for sale sign went up in her yard. Still they wondered: Where was Mary? Only when the new residents started moving in this weekend did a startling possible clue surface. In a gap in the wall, the new residents found a pair of red eyeglasses - like the type Cerruti once wore - and a jumble of human bones. It was a discovery that shocked those who had long searched for Cerruti. They saw the police check the home. They took note when animal control arrived to set traps for the cats she'd once fed. They watched the home get renovated, including new windows and a new roof. And so now they wonder - as they await authorities to confirm whether the remains are hers - how all of those people could have missed the fact that her body may have been there in the wall of her house all along. *** Translator To read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below. Cerruti bought the home on Allston Street around 2001. It was built in 1930 and had last been remodeled in 1998, according to Harris County Appraisal District records. There are two bedrooms and one full bathroom in the 1,161-square-foot home, plus a small porch. Its value has soared to more than 400,000. She had been married and divorced at least once, in 1990, from a man named David Cerruti, to whom she'd been married for 11 years. He now lives in Brooklyn. He shared that Mary had attended the University of Houston and worked mostly in retail. Neighbors who knew her in more recent years believed Cerruti lived alone. The area used to be more dicey, she would say, sharing stories about the brothel across the street. It wasn't until late 2012 that concern grew over plans for a luxury apartment complex to be built around her property. A group of residents organized and attended planning commission meetings to oppose it. \\"Casual elegance and an energetic neighborhood vibe\\" is how its website now describes the building, named for its location, \\"Yale at 6th\\". Neighbors described Cerruti as a shy, kind and frail woman who seemed older than she really was. But she, too, joined the effort to voice her opinion on the issue. She spoke for about one minute at a Planning Commission meeting on Feb. 14, 2013. Recorded testimony shows Cerruti dressed in pink, with eyeglasses perched on her nose and gray hair falling past her shoulders. \\"Literally this project is going to be in my backyard,\\" she said. \\"I'm surrounded. And I just don't see the sense of this project. It seems like just too many apartments for such a small space.\\" In the years that followed, Cerruti faced the trials of a development rising all around her, neighbors said. Her water got cut off. Her car was blocked in the driveway. Construction made getting to her house more difficult - it also made them less likely to pass by her house, where they rarely saw her emerge. The company, Trammell Crow Residential, put in some efforts to help her. A representative from the company did not respond to an emailed request for comment on this story. But when she went missing, neighbors said they told them they believed she was dead. *** It's not clear when, exactly, Cerruti disappeared. At some point, she had stopped making her mortgage payments. Deutsche Bank filed a petition to foreclose on March 4, 2015, online records show. The judgement was signed on Sept. 25. The Houston Police Department's missing person notice went out promptly after, on Sept. 28. It described her as a slight woman, standing at 5 feet 3 inches and weighing 110 pounds. She was last known to have been seen around the time the petition for foreclosure was filed. Neighbors had tried to initiate a missing person's report themselves but had been turned away because they weren't relatives or more closely linked to her. Her ex-husband David was the only person they managed to speak with of any relation. She seemed to prefer to keep to herself. There was only one other personal link they knew of: in February, one neighbor found out, she had sent a Valentine to a friend. But they had continued to worry. Each imagined theories for what had happened: Had she been murdered? Committed to a mental institution? Decided to hide out of embarrassment because she sold her property to the developer after all? A second suit later filed by a tax-related company said that as of May 31, 2016, 22 monthly payments had gone unfulfilled, with 7,395.78 required to cure the default. The amount needed to pay off the tax loan was 25,224.32. Eventually the house was cleaned out. Workers wore masks. Dead cats were found inside. No news emerged - until the discovery of the bones. *** The new residents on Saturday shifted a board in the attic, peered down inside a wall and saw the remains. Nothing else was there but a tattered rag and the red glasses, of the 5 drugstore variety. Animals had disturbed the skeleton, police said. The residents called police in the afternoon, and the medical examiner's office finished extracting the bones shortly before 7 p.m. They appeared to belong to an adult, Houston Police Detective Jason Fay said. The new homeowners were \\"a little worried because they have a body in the house,\\" Fay said. \\"Was it someone who was killed and stuffed in the wall, or did they accidentally pass away by ending up in the wall?\\" It's possible the person tripped in the attic and fell into the empty space, he said. The news troubled many, catching even the realtor and owner Michael Nassif off guard. \\"You probably want to talk about what was discovered there,\\" he said. \\"I don't even know what to tell you. It was really sad.\\" Cerruti's ex-husband had been in Hawaii when the discovery was made. \\"I guess it would be a bit of a relief to find out what exactly happened,\\" he said. \\"Maybe the evidence will clear up the mystery.\\" Hearing word of the news caused neighbor Roxanne Davis' face to fall and mouth to drop in shock. She knew something had happened but had not expected this. \\"I wish I knew what more we could have done, how we could have pushed it farther to get somebody to do something else,\\" she said. Another nearby resident said he felt that he'd failed Davis as a neighbor and as a friend. A third noted that every time he saw her house he wondered what had happened to her. He felt bothered that more of an effort was not made by all involved to find her, asking, \\"This lady could just disappear off the face of this Earth, and nobody knows?\\" This perhaps would help fill in some answers. But there was still an alternative outcome. It was possible the bones were not hers.

Select and prepare a clean ice cube tray. Before you can fill the tray with cool water, you first need to choose an appropriate ice cube tray, which is designed to hold and give shape to the water as it freezes to form ice cubes. There are several types of ice cube trays available in the market, such as plastic, silicone, or metal trays. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, but the most commonly used ones are plastic and silicone, as they offer easy ice cube release and flexibility. To prepare the ice cube tray for use, make sure it is clean and free from any dirt, dust, or residue. Rinse the tray with clean water and, if necessary, use a gentle dish soap to wash it before use. This will ensure that your ice cubes are free from any contaminants or unwanted tastes. After washing, thoroughly dry the tray to prevent dilution of the water you will add in the next step. Once you have selected and prepared your ice cube tray, you can proceed with the remaining steps that you already provided: 2. Fill the tray with cool water. 3. Place the tray in the freezer. 4. Leave the tray in the freezer for a few hours until the water has frozen solid. 5. Take the tray out of the freezer. 6.

Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties. Do you have any questions?","output":"The reduction in federal and state funding for legal aid to the poor in Michigan in 2003 will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the state's most vulnerable population. With a decrease in funding from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) and the Michigan State Bar Foundation, many individuals and families in need of legal assistance may be left without representation or adequate support. The primary reason for the reduction in funding appears to be a decline in the number of people living in poverty in the state, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Legal Services Corporation uses census data to allocate funding across the nation. However, it is crucial to note that despite the decrease in poverty rates, the demand for legal aid services is unlikely to diminish, as the existing poverty population remains sizable, and legal aid funding is insufficient to cover the needs of all those who require these services. The consequences of these funding cuts will be felt most acutely in Wayne County, where the largest concentration of poverty in the state resides. Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's most prominent provider of legal services to the poor, is set to lose over 870,000 in funding for legal aid in the county. This means that thousands of Michigan's poor who require legal assistance may be unable to access it or may receive significantly limited services. Cuts will affect civil legal matters such as landlord-tenant disputes, bankruptcy proceedings, consumer law issues, child custody cases, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. In response to the funding cuts, local legal aid providers will need to work more efficiently and adopt innovative strategies to bridge the gap. This may include increased use of technology, providing more self-help resources and training for clients to navigate the legal system independently, and offering more assistance via telephone and other remote methods. Ultimately, the reduction in funding will necessitate a restructuring of the way legal aid services are provided and accessed in Michigan. To summarize, the decrease in federal and state funding for legal aid services for the poor in Michigan is attributable to a reported decline in poverty rates based on U.S. Census Bureau data. However, the need for legal assistance within this population remains high, and the consequences of the funding cuts are likely to be significantly detrimental to many vulnerable individuals and families. Legal aid providers will need to adapt and find new ways of delivering services in light of these financial challenges."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a Persian passage and a question, and you have to determine whether the question is answerable based on the passage or not.

Let me break it down for you: 1. \\"Ne\\" means \\"no\\" or a negative response. 2. \\"jen\\" means \\"just\\" or \\"only\\". 3. \\"čekám\\" is the verb \\"to wait\\" in the present tense, first person singular (\\"I wait\\" or \\"I am waiting\\"). 4. \\"na\\" is a preposition that is used to indicate the object someone is waiting for. In this case, it means \\"for\\". 5. \\"Ericu\\" is the Czech equivalent of the name \\"Erica\\". So, putting everything together, \\"Ne, jen čekám na Ericu\\" means \\"No, just waiting for Erica\\" in Czech. Keep in mind that Czech doesn't require the subject pronoun (\\"I\\" in English) since the verb conjugation itself conveys the information about the subject. For pronunciation, you would say it like: \\"Ne, yen chekam na Ericu.\\" Remember that Czech language has certain accents on letters that may require more practice to pronounce it correctly."},{"instruction":"Atthemoment,manydevelopingcountriesaresellingtheirnaturalresourcesatverylowprices.Short-termprospectsaretempting,buttheycouldalsomeanthecountriesaresellingofffuturewelfareaswellasgrowth.

Daley's administration in 2009, but renegotiated with Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration. In October 2013, Trump received approval to erect 20-foot (6.1 m) tall stainless steel letters back-lit with white LED lighting spelling out TRUMP on the 16th floor of the building. He made his impending plans for the sign public in February 2014. According to a city planning department spokesperson, standard protocol for such a sign is to require approval from the local alderman (Brendan Reilly, 42nd ward) and the full Chicago City Council. The five letters span a width of approximately 141 feet (43 m), making the final approved version approximately 2,800 square feet (260.1 m2)—2,891 square feet (268.6 m2) according to some sources—rather than the originally proposed size. The sign is located about 200 feet (61 m) above ground level.Crews began hanging the sign in May 2014. When Chicago Tribune architecture critic Kamin warned Trump that his review of the sign would be unfavorable, Trump responded \\"As time passes, it'll be like the Hollywood Sign\\"; architect Smith distanced himself from the sign saying \\"Just for the record, I had nothing to do with this sign!\\" The controversy surrounding the sign drew attention in the national press and international press as it neared completion and the Associated Press ran a story about Mayor Emanuel's disapproval in mid-June. According to the Mayor's spokeswoman Kelley Quinn, \\"Mayor Emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred by an architecturally tasteless sign\\". Kamin has noted that part of the problem is the architectural traditions of the city: \\"If this sign was in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, nobody would care—but it is in Chicago, and in a part of Chicago full of great buildings from the 1920s to the 1960s and onward\\". Trump and Reilly both pointed out how unbecoming the prior Chicago Sun-Times building signage was. As a result of the fiasco,..., can you guess it ?

Richard Guttfield realised 11-month-old pet Wilma was missing moments after an independent courier dropped off an order of dog food. The 51-year-old organised a search when she disappeared and contacted Amazon to check the driver’s GPS log to find out if he had any information. It is believed the data showed the courier had gone home before making his next delivery — and that is where Wilma was found five days later. Mr Guttfield, who owns a printing business, claimed Amazon only took him seriously when he emailed company founder Jeff Bezos. The dad-of-one told The Sun: ‘I just want people to know this can happen. ‘Our homes are all exposed to these drivers and the vast majority of them are great. But low lives will take advantage. It’s just a miracle I got Wilma back.’ He later posted on Facebook: ‘Wilma is safe and home now thanks to an amazing effort from a lot of kind-hearted people.’ Mr Guttfield said he was playing snooker in a converted barn at his £1.5million home in Marsworth, Buckinghamshire, last Friday, when the dog disappeared. The pups sell for £1,200 each and he made an internet appeal and put up posters appealing for Wilma’s return after figuring she had been stolen. He said of his phone calls to Amazon: ‘I had no real suspicions, so I explained it was not a witch hunt. I just wanted to know if the driver could help narrow down the search.’ But, days later, an Amazon worker called Mr Guttfield to ask: ‘Can you describe your dog?’ ‘I described her and he said, “She is here with me right now”,’ he added. ‘He brought her straight over. He was a real star,’ said Mr Guttfield. ‘ I asked how they had found her. He said he couldn’t say as it was under investigation.’ Amazon described the incident as ‘inexcusable’ and said the driver no longer worked for them. ||||| A puppy that was stolen by a driver delivering Amazon parcels in England has been reunited with its owner. Businessman Richard Guttfield, 51, said his black miniature schnauzer Wilma had gone missing after a driver dropped off a package of dog food. Guttfield said it was only after he emailed Amazon's CEO and founder Jeff Bezos in a plea to have his dog returned that the company responded. \\"My puppy went missing after an Amazon delivery and after an email to Jeff (Bezos)… we had someone who was amazing who tracked the driver and found our dog and brought her home,\\" he told CNBC. Amazon said that the driver in question would no longer deliver its packages. Drivers that deliver parcels for Amazon do not technically work for the company, but through a number of independent couriers. \\"This is inexcusable and does not reflect the high standards we have for our delivery partners,\\" a spokesperson for the company said in an emailed statement. \\"We take these matters seriously and this individual is no longer delivering Amazon packages for the independent delivery service provider.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A dog owner in Buckinghamshire, England, was reunited with his 11-month-old miniature schnauzer after it was stolen by a driver delivering Amazon packages to his home.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"The stone flew freely in the air.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The balloon flew freely in the air.\\" Let's reason step by step:","output":"To determine which sentence goes against common sense, let's analyze each sentence separately. Sentence A: \\"The stone flew freely in the air.\\" Stones are inanimate objects, and they are heavier than air. Ordinarily, stones do not possess the ability to fly or float in the air. For a stone to be airborne, an external force (e.g., someone throwing it) would be required. Sentence B: \\"The balloon flew freely in the air.\\" Balloons, when filled with lighter-than-air gases like helium, can naturally float and fly in the air. This is a common occurrence and aligns with common sense. Given the reasoning above, Sentence A: \\"The stone flew freely in the air,\\" is against common sense, as stones cannot naturally levitate or fly in the air without external force."},{"instruction":"but it has its roots in hinduism.

It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines. - African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War. - The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s, ending with the Great Depression, in which jazz music and dance styles became popular, mainly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties. - A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \\"musical form\\" and \\"musical style\\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated. - Polyrhythm is the simultaneous use of two or more conflicting rhythms, that are not readily perceived as deriving from one another, or as simple manifestations of the same meter. The rhythmic conflict may be the basis of an entire piece of music (cross-rhythm), or a momentary disruption. Polyrhythms can be distinguished from irrational rhythms, which can occur within the context of a single part; polyrhythms require at least two rhythms to be played concurrently, one of which is typically an irrational rhythm. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove. - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana. The population of the city was 343,829 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The New Orleans metropolitan area (New OrleansMetairieKenner Metropolitan Statistical Area) had a population of 1,167,764 in 2010 and was the 46th largest in the United States. The New OrleansMetairieBogalusa Combined Statistical Area, a larger trading area, had a 2010 population of 1,452,502. - Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or \\"folk\\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences. - Ragtime also spelled rag-time or rag time is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. - Andrew Dewey Kirk ( May 28 , 1898 -- December 11 , 1992 ) was a jazz saxophonist and tubist best known as a bandleader of the \`\` Twelve Clouds of Joy '' , popular during the swing era . Kirk grew up in Denver , Colorado , where he was tutored by Wilberforce Whiteman , Paul Whiteman 's father . Kirk started his musical career playing with George Morrison 's band , but then went on to join Terrence Holder 's Dark Clouds of Joy . In 1929 he was elected leader after Holder departed . Renaming the band Clouds of Joy , Kirk also relocated the band from Dallas , Texas , to Kansas City , Kansas . Although officially titled as the Clouds of Joy , the band has also been known to be called the Twelve Clouds of Joy due to the number of musicians in the band . They set up in the Pla - Mor Ballroom on the junction of 32nd and Main in Kansas City and made their first recording for Brunswick Records that same year . Mary Lou Williams came in as pianist at the last moment , but she impressed Brunswick 's Dave Kapp , so she became a regular member of the band . Kirk moved the band to Kansas City , and since their first recordings in 1929 -- 1930 , they grew highly popular as they epitomized the Kansas City jazz sound . In mid- 1936 , he was signed to Decca and made scores of popular records until 1946 . He presumably disbanded and reformed his band during that 6 - year recording layoff , as his 1929 - 1930 Brunswick appeared to have sold well enough to stay in the catalog through the period and 1933 - 34 pressings ( with the mid- 1930s label variations ) have been seen . In 1938 , Kirk and band held the top spot of the Billboard chart for 12 weeks with \`\` I Wo n't Tell a Soul ( I Love You ) '' , written by Hughie Charles and Ross Parker , featuring Pha Terrell on vocals . In 1942 , Kirk and His Clouds of Joy recorded \`\` Take It and Git '' , which on October 24 , 1942 , became the first single to hit number one on the Harlem Hit Parade , the predecessor to the Billboard R&B chart .

Question: A ball moves slower across the carpet than it does on the marble flooring. This is because the _____ has less resistance. (A) carpet (B) marble flooring The answer is:","output":"(B) marble flooring A ball moves slower across the carpet than it does on the marble flooring because the marble flooring has less resistance. In this scenario, the two main factors affecting the movement of the ball are the surface materials (carpet and marble) and the friction between these surfaces and the ball. Carpet is a soft, fibrous material made up of a pile attached to a backing. It usually consists of woven or tufted fibers and can be made from natural materials like wool or synthetic materials like nylon or polyester. On the other hand, marble is a hard, smooth, and polished stone that is derived from metamorphic rocks, particularly limestone. When a ball moves across a surface, it experiences friction, which is the force resisting its movement. This force is generated by the interaction of the ball's surface with the surface it is moving over. The amount of friction depends on the characteristics of the two surfaces in contact, as well as the weight of the object (in this case, the ball) and the normal force acting on the object due to gravity. In general, smoother and harder surfaces tend to produce less friction and therefore less resistance to the movement of the ball. The texture and the surface area of the material in contact with the ball affect the friction between them. When a ball moves over a carpeted surface, many small fibers from the carpet are in contact with the ball, which increases the surface area and, consequently, the friction between the ball and the carpet. This increased friction slows the ball down. On the other hand, when a ball moves over marble flooring, there is a much smaller surface area in contact with the ball, due to the smoothness of the marble. Thus, the friction between the ball and the marble surface is reduced, resulting in less resistance. Consequently, the ball moves faster on marble flooring compared to carpet. This difference in resistance can also be attributed to the stiffness of the material. Carpet, being a soft and pliable material, tends to absorb some of the energy from the moving ball, which contributes to the slowing down of the ball. In contrast, marble is a much more rigid and unyielding material, which means that less energy is absorbed from the moving ball, allowing it to maintain its speed. In conclusion, the ball moves slower across the carpet than on the marble flooring due to the increased friction and resistance caused by the characteristics of the carpet's material. The marble flooring, being smoother, harder, and more rigid, has less resistance, allowing the ball to move at a faster pace across its surface."},{"instruction":"Seiji Kato and his associates at the Langley Center of NASA published in 2006 the results of an investigation of the effect of decreasing sea ice in the Arctic on the amount of radiant energy reflected from the Arctic Please fix the punctuation.","output":"Seiji Kato and his associates at the Langley Center of NASA published, in 2006, the results of an investigation of the effect of decreasing sea ice in the Arctic on the amount of radiant energy reflected from the Arctic.

Choices: - membrane - fruit - mutation - protein A:","output":"Unlike eukaryotic cells, DNA and RNA synthesis in prokaryotic cells occurs together with the synthesis of proteins. Prokaryotic cells are characterized by their simplicity and lack of internal cellular compartments. They are the most ancient form of life and include bacteria and archaea. Unlike eukaryotic cells, which have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, prokaryotic cells have no nucleus and their DNA is not separated from the rest of the cell contents. This unique organization allows for simultaneous transcription and translation, processes that are separated in space and time in eukaryotic cells. DNA synthesis, or replication, in prokaryotic cells occurs in the cytoplasm, where the DNA is located. This process is initiated by enzymes that untwist and unzip the DNA double helix, creating a replication fork. DNA polymerase enzymes then help synthesize a complementary strand of DNA for each of the original strands, resulting in two identical copies of the DNA molecule. RNA synthesis, or transcription, also takes place in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells. The process starts when an enzyme, called RNA polymerase, binds to a specific sequence on the DNA, known as the promoter. The DNA is then unwound, and RNA polymerase synthesizes a complementary RNA molecule using one of the DNA strands as a template. The coupling of transcription and translation in prokaryotic cells is referred to as \\"co-transcriptional translation\\" or \\"coupled transcription and translation.\\" Unlike eukaryotic cells, where transcription occurs in the nucleus and the mRNA must be processed and transported to the cytoplasm for translation, prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and other cellular compartments. As a result, transcription and translation can occur simultaneously. When the mRNA is being synthesized during transcription, ribosomes can already bind to the mRNA molecule and begin translating it into a protein sequence. This means that protein synthesis starts while the mRNA is still being formed. This coupling of processes allows prokaryotic cells to have a faster rate of gene expression and protein synthesis as compared to eukaryotic cells, enabling them to quickly respond and adapt to changes in their environment. In summary, unlike eukaryotic cells, DNA and RNA synthesis in prokaryotic cells occurs together with the synthesis of proteins. This simultaneous process results from the lack of compartmentalization within the prokaryotic cell and provides them with a faster rate of gene expression and protein production as compared to their eukaryotic counterparts."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: Today there is little to see, apart from the remains of Peter's House (the veracity of which can neither be proved nor disproved) and a ruined second- to third-century synagogue.

In the first quarter, the Colts drew first blood as quarterback Peyton Manning completed a five-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marvin Harrison for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, Dillon helped the Patriots respond with a one-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis would re-take the lead on a one-yard touchdown run by rookie running back Joseph Addai. Dillon again tied the game, this time on a four-yard touchdown run. Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri then nailed a 23-yard field goal to give the Colts a lead they would not relinquish. In the third quarter, the duo of Manning and Harrison struck again with a four-yard touchdown strike. The Patriots responded with a 49-yard field goal, Gostkowski's career longest to date. In the fourth quarter, Vinatieri kicked a 31-yard field goal to make the score 27-17. On the Patriots next possession they drove down the field but ended up going 3-and-out in the red zone and settled for a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. On the Colts' ensuing drive, a drive set up a Vinatieri field goal attempt but the former Patriots kicker missed this one to give his former team a chance to tie it up and send the game into overtime. However, the Patriots comeback attempt was thwarted when a Brady pass deflected off the hands of Faulk and was intercepted by Cato June. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 6-2.

Meanwhile, Patriots' kicker, Gostkowski, made a 49-yard field goal (his career-longest) and a 26-yard field goal. Thus, in this game, Gostkowski had both the longest (49 yards) and the shortest (26 yards) field goal attempts.

A:","output":"Samadhi is a state of deep concentration or meditative absorption, where one's mind becomes completely focused, calm, tranquil, and free from distractions. It is an essential aspect of the Noble Eightfold Path in Buddhism, specifically the element of \\"right concentration\\" (samyaksamādhi). To train in samadhi, the primary method used is meditation. Meditation helps to cultivate a focused and undistracted mind, allowing practitioners to gradually develop deeper levels of concentration. Through regular practice, one's mind becomes increasingly purified of mental defilements, such as greed, aversion, and ignorance. This purification process leads to a sense of inner peace, well-being, and heightened awareness. There are various techniques that can be practiced to develop samadhi, including: 1. Mindfulness of breathing (ānāpānasati): This involves focusing one's attention on the breath, observing its natural rhythm and sensation as it flows in and out of the body. This practice helps to build concentration and calm the mind. 2. Loving-kindness meditation (mettā bhāvanā): This practice involves cultivating feelings of goodwill and compassion towards oneself and others, thus promoting a more focused and tranquil state of mind. 3. Concentration on an object (kasiṇa): In this method, the meditator chooses an external object, such as a colored disc or a candle flame, and focuses their attention on it to develop concentration and stillness of mind. 4. Contemplation of the body (kāyagatāsati): This technique involves a systematic examination of the body's various components and functions to develop insight into its impermanent, unsatisfactory, and impersonal nature, thereby promoting mental clarity and calm. As one progresses in their meditation practice, they will experience deeper levels of samadhi and greater mental clarity. Mastering samadhi not only leads to mental tranquility and well-being but also paves the way for insight into the true nature of reality and, ultimately, liberation from suffering."},{"instruction":"Short movie review: cliched and Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the given information The short movie review states \\"cliched.\\" Step 2: Determine the tone and sentiment The word \\"cliched\\" is generally associated with a negative sentiment as it implies overused, predictable, or unoriginal elements in the movie.

Explanation: To begin with, physical exercise has been proven to be beneficial for the overall well-being of an individual. When considering the impact of exercise on physical health, we can see numerous advantages. Regular exercise can help maintain a healthy body weight, improve muscle strength and endurance, and even help reduce the risk of developing various diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Furthermore, exercising regularly has been linked to better mental health as well. By engaging in physical activities, individuals can combat stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, thereby boosting their overall mental well-being. This is attributed to the release of endorphins – chemicals in the brain that help alleviate pain and produce a feeling of happiness and satisfaction. It is also essential to consider the social benefits that can arise from regular exercise. Participating in sports, group fitness classes, or even going for a walk with friends can foster a sense of community and belonging, as well as promote better interpersonal relationships. Finally, staying active has been shown to boost cognitive functioning, including enhanced concentration, memory, and overall cognitive performance – especially as people age. This can ultimately contribute to a better quality of life, more independence, and a reduced risk of cognitive decline in older adults. Taking all these factors into account, does regular exercise have positive effects on a person's physical, mental, and social well-being? Based on the evidence and benefits presented, the answer is yes."},{"instruction":"May have to go to the er ...my throat is swollen and has a big knot on the right side.

Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an overachieving junior with an insufferable air of self-importance. Earlier in the year, another teacher, Jim's best friend Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik) was fired from his job and divorced by his wife, Linda (Delaney Driscoll) after it came out that he and Tracy were having a sexual affair, while Tracy's reputation was unscathed. Against this backdrop, Tracy announces that she is running for student council president. Initially she is unopposed, as she is widely seen as the natural candidate for the job. When Tracy presents Mr. McAllister with her list of nominating signatures to qualify for the election ballot, she makes a remark about \\"working closely\\" together that he interprets as an indication she may try to seduce him. Perhaps annoyed by Tracy's presumptuousness, and/or concerned that he might give in to this seduction and share the same fate as his friend Dave, Mr. McAllister decides to persuade junior Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), a slow-witted, but affable and popular football player to enter the race. Paul is unable to play football as he is recovering from a ski injury that resulted in his left leg being broken, and Mr. McAllister suggests a new way to explore his talents through student council. Although Paul is ambivalent at first, he agrees to run, much to Tracy's consternation. Meanwhile, Paul's adopted younger sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) is rejected by her romantic interest Lisa (Frankie Ingrassia), who dismisses their time together as \\"experimenting.\\" Lisa then engages in a passionate relationship with Paul.

Today, it is popular throughout the Middle East (including Turkey), North Africa (including Morocco), and in Middle Eastern cuisine around the globe. It can be found in most grocery stores in North America. - The Oleaceae are a family of flowering plants in the order Lamiales. It presently comprises 26 genera, one of which is recently extinct. The 25 extant genera include \\"Cartrema\\", which was resurrected in 2012. The number of species in the Oleaceae is variously estimated in a wide range around 700. The Oleaceae consist of shrubs, trees, and a few lianas. The flowers are often numerous and highly odoriferous. The family has a subcosmopolitan distribution, ranging from the subarctic to the southernmost parts of Africa, Australia, and South America. Notable members of the Oleaceae include olive, ash, jasmine, and several popular ornamental plants including privet, forsythia, fringetrees, and lilac. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Greek cuisine is a Mediterranean cuisine. It has some common characteristics with the traditional cuisines of Italy, and the Balkans. - Old French (', ', \\"\\"; Modern French ) was the Gallo-Romance dialect continuum spoken from the 9th century to the 14th century. In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region. - A purée (or mash) is cooked food, usually vegetables or legumes, that has been ground, pressed, blended or sieved to the consistency of a soft creamy paste or thick liquid. Purées of specific foods are often known by specific names, e.g., applesauce or hummus. The term is of French origin, where it meant in Old French (13th century) \\"purified\\" or \\"refined\\". - Skordalia or skordhalia / skorthalia ( ( skorðaa ) ; in Greek also called ' aliada / aliatha ) is a thick puree ( or sauce , dip , spread , etc. ) in Greek cuisine made by combining crushed garlic with a bulky base -- which may be a purée of potatoes , walnuts , almonds , or liquid - soaked stale bread -- and then beating in olive oil to make a smooth emulsion . Vinegar is often added . - Mediterranean cuisine is the food from the lands around the Mediterranean Sea and its preparation. This geographical area broadly follows the distribution of the olive tree, which provides one of the most distinctive features of the region's cooking, olive oil. - The Balkan Peninsula, or the Balkans, is a peninsula and a cultural area in Eastern and Southeastern Europe with various and disputed borders. The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch from the Serbia-Bulgaria border to the Black Sea. - Olive oil is a fat obtained from the olive (the fruit of \\"Olea europaea\\"; family Oleaceae), a traditional tree crop of the Mediterranean Basin. The oil is produced by pressing whole olives. It is commonly used in cooking, whether for frying or as a salad dressing. It is also used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and soaps, and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps, and finds uses in some religions. It is associated with the Mediterranean diet popularized since the 1950s in North America for its possible health benefits. The olive is one of the three core food plants in Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat and the grape. - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa. - The olive, known by the botanical name Olea europaea, meaning \\"European olive\\", is a species of small tree in the family Oleaceae, found in the Mediterranean Basin from Portugal to the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and southern Asia as far east as China, as well as the Canary Islands, Mauritius and Réunion. The species is cultivated in many places and considered naturalized in all the countries of the Mediterranean coast, as well as in Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Java, Norfolk Island, California and Bermuda. - The Mediterranean diet is a modern nutritional recommendation originally inspired by the dietary patterns of Greece, Southern Italy, and Spain in the 1940s and 1950s. The principal aspects of this diet include proportionally high consumption of olive oil, legumes, unrefined cereals, fruits, and vegetables, moderate to high consumption of fish, moderate consumption of dairy products (mostly as cheese and yogurt), moderate wine consumption, and low consumption of non-fish meat products.

He is experimenting with colliding particles. He has two samples of particles, sample A and sample B. Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles. Would kinetic energy in sample B likely be lost or retained? Hint: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form. Answer:","output":"Given the information and hint provided, we can infer that the collisions between gas particles (sample A) are assumed to be elastic. In elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved, meaning that no kinetic energy is lost during the collisions. Sample B, however, does not contain gas particles. Depending on the nature of the particles and their interactions, the collisions in sample B may be inelastic. In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is not conserved, and some of the energy may be lost in other forms, such as heat or light. Since we don't have specific information about the type of particles in sample B and their interactions, we cannot precisely determine whether kinetic energy will be lost or retained. However, given the mention of gas particles having elastic collisions, it can be implied that sample B, which does not contain gas particles, might have a higher likelihood of experiencing inelastic collisions, where kinetic energy could be lost or transformed into other forms of energy."},{"instruction":"My cousin from my mom 's side was up to visit since last Wednesday night .

Apply this mixture to your boots using a stiff brush. Scrub vigorously to remove any dirt that is on your boots. If you do not have any leather bleach, use a leather cleaner to remove any dirt. Take the time to thoroughly clean your boots. The more dirt you remove, the better the final outcome will be. Use circular motions as you scrub your boots. Once your boots are clean, you must remove the protective coating. Your boots were likely treated with some type of protective finish when they were initially dyed. A deglazer will remove this coating so the dye can be absorbed. To get the best results, you need to remove all of this before you apply the dye. Use a wet cloth or sponge to rub the deglazer all over your boots. The finish and some of the color will come off when you apply the deglazer. You may want to do this outside because the fumes can be very strong. Use a white cloth or rag because you do not want the color from the rag to bleed onto your boots. Use a toothbrush to get the areas between the sole and upper. Wait for the deglazer to evaporate. This usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes. Once your boots have dried, run a damp rag over your boots to make sure you that you have removed all the protective finish. If you still see some shiny areas on your boots, you need to deglaze them again. Removing the protective finish is critical to a successful dye job.

Within a few weeks, her son proclaimed himself her co-ruler as King Charles I of Castile and Aragon. Charles had been raised in Netherlands and his affairs were mostly controlled by the Flemish noble William de Croÿ, sieur de Chièvres. In 1517, the seventeen-year-old King sailed to Castile, where he was formally recognised as King of Castile. There, his Flemish court provoked much scandal, as de Croÿ shamelessly sold government privileges for personal money and installed other Flemish nobles into government offices. In May 1518, Charles traveled to Barcelona in Aragon, where he would remain for nearly two years. Here, he haggled with Aragon's slightly stronger cortes, the Generalitat, for privileges and his formal recognition as King of Aragon. Aragon managed to maintain more local control than Castile did, but mostly because Aragon was poorer and there was no point in pressing the issue for extra tax money that wasn't there to be collected. In 1519, the King's paternal grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, died. Charles competed with King Francis I of France to win the imperial election by aggressively bribing prince-electors. Charles won, becoming Emperor Charles V. He left Aragon to return to Castile to raise funds to pay down the debts he had incurred in the election. The taxes granted to Charles at a Castilian cortes in Corunna would help spark the Revolt of the Comuneros of Castile. Of more importance for Aragon, in the summer of 1519 Charles granted his permission to the Germanies to arm themselves against the raiding Muslim fleets.

Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name.

So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","output":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"Land degradation causes what effects on the environment?\\" would be (F). negative. This is because the teacher mentioned the negative impact of soil erosion on the environment and the increasing prevalence of land degradation due to various contributing factors like erosion, salination, and pollution. Land degradation is a pervasive global issue that broadly refers to the deterioration of land quality due to human activities and natural processes. The negative impacts of land degradation on the environment are extensive and can lead to several consequences. Some of these consequences include: 1. Decreased soil fertility: As soil erodes or becomes polluted, its ability to support plant growth and agriculture is compromised. Essentially, vital nutrients are washed away or leached out, rendering the land less productive. 2. Loss of biodiversity: As land becomes degraded, the local habitat is disrupted, which in turn reduces the variety of plant and animal species that can inhabit the ecosystem. In extreme cases, it may lead to localized extinction of certain species. 3. Climate change: Land degradation can contribute to global climate change in several ways. The loss of vegetation cover due to degraded soil decreases the amount of carbon sequestered by plants. This, in turn, increases the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming. Additionally, eroded soil can release carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to climate change. 4. Water pollution: Erosion and soil runoff can contaminate water bodies, including rivers, lakes, and oceans. This can lead to numerous ecological problems, such as eutrophication and the subsequent formation of dead zones, killing off aquatic life. 5. Social and economic impacts: Land degradation can have significant social and economic repercussions for local communities and the global economy. Agricultural productivity decreases, which can lead to food shortages, increased food prices, and reduced income for farmers.

Tom is also dealing with flashbacks from his combat service as an Army Captain in both the European and Pacific theaters, involving men that he killed (including, by accident, his best friend), and a young Italian girl named Maria, with whom he had a brief but heartfelt affair in Italy despite his being in a relationship with Betsy at the time. Before he left Maria for the final time to go back into battle, Tom was told that she was pregnant and was going to keep the baby. He would never see her or the child again. When an expected inheritance from Tom's recently deceased grandmother turns out to have been depleted, leaving only her large and unsaleable mansion, Betsy pressures Tom to seek a higher-paying job.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"We used our tax income to help foreign poor people\\" - Sentence B: \\"We used our tax income to help local poor people\\"","output":"To determine which of these sentences doesn't make sense, let's analyze each sentence and its implications logically. Sentence A: \\"We used our tax income to help foreign poor people\\" - Step 1: This sentence implies that the tax income collected was used for humanitarian purposes. - Step 2: It specifies that the aid was directed toward poor people in foreign countries. - Step 3: Providing support to foreign individuals in need is not an inherently illogical idea. Governments and organizations often help others internationally through various types of aid. Sentence B: \\"We used our tax income to help local poor people\\" - Step 1: This sentence also implies that the tax income collected was used for humanitarian purposes. - Step 2: It specifies that the aid was directed toward poor people within the local community or country. - Step 3: Providing support to local individuals in need is a common and logical use of tax income, as it contributes to the well-being of the local community and potentially helps to reduce poverty. Both sentences seem to make sense based on the logical analysis. Neither options appear to be nonsensical."},{"instruction":"Answer this question. What colour is the mineral Lapis Lazuli?","output":"Lapis Lazuli is a vibrant blue mineral with a rich and striking color. This beautiful gemstone has been highly appreciated since ancient times for its vivid hue, and it continues to be a sought-after material for various applications, including jewelry, decorative items, and pigments. The characteristic blue color of Lapis Lazuli can range from deep, dark blue to a lighter, more muted shade, often exhibiting shades of azure or ultramarine. This variation in color arises from the presence of the mineral lazurite, which is mainly responsible for the vibrant blue coloration. Lazurite is a complex sulfate mineral composed of sodium, calcium, aluminum, and sulfur. The specific concentration and distribution of lazurite within the Lapis Lazuli matrix determine the intensity and uniformity of the blue color. In addition to the dominant blue hue, Lapis Lazuli often contains other minerals that create a unique and beautiful visual complexity. For example, white calcite veins can be observed running through the stone, creating a marbled appearance. Moreover, the presence of golden Pyrite inclusions (iron sulfide) adds a sparkling quality to the gemstone, enhancing its visual appeal. It is important to highlight that the quality of Lapis Lazuli can vary greatly depending on its composition, geological origin, and mining conditions, all of which can affect the stone's color and texture. The finest quality stones possess an even, intense blue hue with minimal visible white calcite and a dusting of golden Pyrite inclusions, giving the stone a luxurious and captivating appearance. Stones with more calcite tend to be lighter, and those with more lazurite have a richer blue color. In summary, Lapis Lazuli is a visually striking mineral known for its rich and vibrant blue color, which results from the presence of lazurite in the stone. The specific shade of blue can vary from deep, dark blue to lighter azure shades, with the color's intensity and texture further influenced by the presence of other minerals such as calcite and Pyrite. As a result, Lapis Lazuli has been highly valued for thousands of years for its unique beauty and is still widely used today as a gemstone, decorative material, and pigment."},{"instruction":"Soylent Green is a classic.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When we think of even numbers, we know they are numbers that are divisible by 2. Starting from the smallest even number, we have 2, then 4, and so on. To find the sum of the first ten even numbers, let's list them out: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20. Now, we can simply add these numbers together: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 + 20. Adding these values, we get the sum: 2 + 4 = 6, 6 + 6 = 12, 12 + 8 = 20, 20 + 10 = 30, 30 + 12 = 42, 42 + 14 = 56, 56 + 16 = 72, 72 + 18 = 90, and finally, 90 + 20 = 110. Since we have calculated for the sum of the first ten even numbers, we notice we've missed something because the answer should be 50. Going back, we need to adjust starting from the sum of 42. Instead of 56, we should have added 42 + 14 = 46, then 46 + 16 = 62. So, correcting our calculation, we have 62 + 18 = 80, and 80 + 20 = 100. We realize the discrepancy stems from a typo in the question, which should have asked for the sum of the first five even numbers, not the first ten. That's why the correct answer is 50, as this is indeed the sum of the first five even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"well no that's true it's not but it is i mean they're coming i mean we've we've got\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"They're not coming. \\" is true?","output":"To come to a conclusion about the hypothesis, let's analyze the provided premise step-by-step. Step 1: Break down the premise The premise is a bit unclear and ambiguous, but we can attempt to identify key phrases: - \\"well no that's true\\" - \\"it's not but it is\\" - \\"i mean they're coming\\" - \\"i mean we've we've got\\" Step 2: Analyze the information Based on the key phrases, we can make some observations: - The speaker initially seems to agree with a previous statement (\\"well no that's true\\"). - There is some internal conflict or uncertainty in the speaker's mind (\\"it's not but it is\\"). - The speaker indicates that \\"they're coming\\". - The speaker also seems to imply that some preparation or resources are available (\\"we've we've got\\"). Step 3: Compare the information against the hypothesis The hypothesis states, \\"They're not coming.\\" However, the premise does include the phrase \\"i mean they're coming,\\" which directly contradicts the hypothesis. The other parts of the premise do not provide clear evidence for or against the hypothesis, as they are more focused on the speaker's uncertainty and potential preparations. Step 4: Conclusion Based on our analysis, the premise does not support or confirm the hypothesis \\"They're not coming\\" to be true. Instead, there is evidence within the premise that suggests \\"they're coming,\\" which contradicts the hypothesis. Furthermore, the speaker's uncertainty adds ambiguity to the information provided, making it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - Earl of Longford is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Ireland. - The Peerage of Ireland is a 19th century creation, and is different from the more ancient native Gaelic peerage used by Irish aristocracy from before the arrival of Christianity. The Gaelic system was disrupted by the English peerage in the early modern period by confiscations deemed illegal in Continental courts at the time. The latter system consists of those titles of nobility created by the English monarchs in their capacity as Lord or King of Ireland, or later by monarchs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The English ranks of the Irish peerage are Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount and Baron, whilst the Irish system uses Gaelic titles, in accordance with a genealogy of the Ard Rí (High King of Ireland) chronicled in numerous ancient manuscripts, including the Annals of the Four Masters. The Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland continues to exercise jurisdiction over its Peerage of Ireland, but not those peers whose titles derive from places located in what is now the Republic of Ireland. Importantly, Article 40.2 of the Irish Constitution forbids conference of titles of nobility by anyone but the Uatarán -- President of the Republic -- and a citizen may not accept titles of nobility or honour except with the prior approval of the Government. Gaelic titles of nobility, amongst the oldest in European history, remain the providence of individual clanna or families.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When trying to interpret a person's thoughts and emotions, we often rely on non-verbal cues like facial expressions and body language. These cues can provide valuable information about how someone is feeling, especially when they are combined with the context of a situation. However, facial expressions and body language can be misleading or ambiguous at times, as they can be influenced by cultural differences, personal habits, or specific circumstances. For example, the same smile could indicate genuine happiness or a polite yet insincere reaction, making it difficult to infer emotions with complete accuracy. Moreover, some individuals might be more skilled at masking emotions or maintaining a neutral expression, further complicating the interpretation process. Additionally, since people are unique, it is hard to establish universal standards for understanding emotions through non-verbal cues. Psychologists and other researchers have been studying the complexities of human emotions for decades, but even with advancements in the field, we continue to learn about emotions and their diversity. In conclusion, while facial expressions and body language can offer some insights to a person's emotions and thoughts, it is not possible to tell with absolute certainty what someone is feeling or thinking just by observing these non-verbal cues."},{"instruction":"Question: when will ie9 be released?

Movie title: Outland Movie plot: In the future, Federal Marshal William O'Niel (Sean Connery) is assigned to a tour of duty at the titanium ore mining outpost Con-Am 27, operated by the company Conglomerates Amalgamated on the Jovian moon of Io. Conditions on Io are difficult: gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, spacesuits are cumbersome, and miners carry their own air supply. Shifts are long, but significant bonuses are paid. The outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), boasts that productivity has broken all previous records since he took over. O'Niel's wife Carol (Kika Markham) feels she cannot raise their son Paul on Io, fleeing with the child to the Jupiter space station to await a shuttle back to Earth. Later, a miner named Tarlow (John Ratzenberger) suffers an attack of stimulant psychosis: he sees spiders and rips open his spacesuit, resulting in his death by explosive decompression. Cane, another miner, enters an elevator without his spacesuit during another psychotic episode, and likewise dies from decompression. With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel investigates the deaths. Another incident involves a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O'Niel attempts to calm the man while Montone (James B. Sikking), his sergeant, sneaks in via the air duct and kills Sagan with a shotgun. O'Niel and Lazarus discover that Sagan had traces of a powerful amphetamine-type drug in his bloodstream, which would allow the miners to work continuously for days at a time, until they \\"burn out\\" and turn psychotic after approximately ten months of use.

Answer:","output":"In the movie Outland, Federal Marshal William O'Niel (Sean Connery) faces a significant challenge when he tries to bring down the drug distribution ring run by the outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), as well as his own corrupt sergeant, Montone. As a result of his investigation and attempts to expose the illegal activities, O'Niel becomes a target for several hitmen who are hired to kill him and silence further opposition. To get rid of the hitmen, O'Niel utilizes a combination of strategic thinking, his skills as a Federal Marshal, and the unique environment of the mining outpost on Io. He takes several steps to eliminate the threats and stay alive while continuing his efforts to bring down the corrupt officials. First, O'Niel uses the outpost's surveillance system to monitor the movements of the hitmen, track their locations, and gain critical information about their plans. This allows him to remain one step ahead and avoid being an easy target. Second, he capitalizes on his knowledge and experience as a Federal Marshal, using his instincts to identify potential ambushes and develop strategies to counter the hitmen's attacks. Next, O'Niel uses the environmental conditions on Io to his advantage. Due to the low gravity and lack of breathable atmosphere, the hitmen must wear cumbersome spacesuits and carry air supplies to survive. This makes them slower and more vulnerable than they would be under normal circumstances. O'Niel exploits this fact by utilizing the terrain and structures of the outpost to his advantage, setting traps and forcing the hitmen into disadvantageous positions. Additionally, O'Niel receives support from Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), who reluctantly decides to help him in his battle against the hitmen and the corruption that is plaguing their community. Her knowledge and insight into the outpost, as well as her medical expertise, prove invaluable in aiding O'Niel. Finally, O'Niel's determination, resourcefulness, and commitment to justice help him persevere in the face of danger. Despite facing seemingly insurmountable odds and an enemy that includes his own allies, he remains focused on his mission and refuses to back down. Throughout these efforts, O'Niel successfully eliminates the hitmen who were sent to kill him, either through direct confrontations or by outmaneuvering them. He takes down the drug distribution ring run by Sheppard and Montone, protecting the miners and their families and holding the corrupt officials accountable for their actions. Through his courage and skill, O'Niel triumphs over the forces of greed and corruption and serves as an example of justice and integrity in a challenging and unforgiving environment."},{"instruction":"Pick one category for the following text.

So, it's reasonably valid to listen to what I say about my experience at The Shady Tavern, a place where I had the misfortune of spending an evening. With great disappointment, I pen this review to let potential visitors know the truth about this establishment and its reputation. First, let me shed some light on the location and ambiance. The Shady Tavern's name fits well, as it is situated in a dark, poorly lit alley that immediately evokes an eerie feeling. The establishment clearly has not been given much attention in terms of maintenance, with paint peeling off the walls, graffiti littered across its facade, and cigarette butts scattered on the ground near the entrance. Upon entering the tavern, one cannot help but notice the pungent combination of stale beer, dampness, and the unmistakable stench of sweat. This place desperately needs a deep clean to rid it of these unpleasant odors. The dim lighting inside only adds to the overall shady atmosphere, which feels more like a place for clandestine activities than a relaxing spot to unwind. Once seated, it took an incredibly long time to get our server's attention. We were left unattended for nearly 20 minutes before we could even place our drink orders. When the server finally approached us, they seemed disheveled and disinterested, barely making any eye contact and showing no knowledge of the menu. The inattentive service persisted throughout the night, making it highly frustrating to get any refills, food orders, or even the simplest of requests attended to. Now, let's discuss the food and drinks—both of which can only be described as severely lacking in quality and taste. The food menu, while extensive, seemed to have confused quantity for quality. The dishes that were served to our table were at best mediocre and at worst inedible. The so-called \\"gourmet burger\\" was dry and overcooked, the \\"Crispy Fried Chicken\\" bore a suspicious resemblance to microwavable nuggets, and the \\"Fresh Garden Salad\\" was a sad assortment of wilted greens with a dressing that tasted like it came straight out of a bottle. As for the drinks, one expects a tavern to have a reasonable beer selection and perhaps some decent options in terms of wine and cocktails. This was not the case at The Shady Tavern. The beer list consisted of just a handful of generic, non-craft options, all of which tasted lukewarm and stale. Attempting a cocktail was a gamble, as it seemed like the bartender had no training in mixology. The margarita was unbearably sweet, with barely a hint of tequila, while the so-called \\"Old Fashioned\\" ended up being a muddy, undrinkable concoction. To top off the already unpleasant evening, the noise level was intolerable. It was clear that no effort was made to provide any sort of soundproofing or noise reduction. Conversations were impossible to maintain due to this unbearable cacophony, making it necessary to shout just to be heard by the person sitting next to you. Overall, my experience at The Shady Tavern was nothing short of disastrous. From the moment I arrived, everything about this place—from its dingy location to the subpar food and drinks, to the woefully inadequate service—left a bitter taste in my mouth. Do yourself a favor and avoid The Shady Tavern at all costs. There are plenty of other establishments that will give you much better value for your money and a memorable night that you would actually want to reminisce about."},{"instruction":"Given a sentence in German, generate a new German sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

The goal is 100,000. The drive to pay for free legal services will continue for the next two months. The money goes to Idaho Legal Aid Services and the Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program. Last year, more than 5,000 petitions were filed in Idaho for protection orders in domestic violence cases. More than 12,000 victims contacted shelters or crisis hotlines. Joining Trout in the announcement was Idaho Bar Association President Fred Hoopes of Idaho Falls and Ida-West Energy Co.

Like ANY American, he moved his family to be compatable with his upwardly mobile status but forgot, there was still alot of problems going on. The only African Americans in the neighborhood at the time was the maids. One owning a home? Wow. Then the blending in began. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is told to \\"get involved\\" so she does what all the other women in her neighborhood do.

What this film shows you is the great pains it takes for this family to fit in, and how they lose themselves in the process. It makes you question where does racism begin and end...and with whom. It shows how no matter what colour you are and how much money you have, you can still shut yourself off from the real world and helping those around you. It also shows how these African American children, when \\"blending in\\" neighborhoods such as these fall into the trap of changing themselves to suit the culture (complete with blonde hair and blue eyes, mind you!) around them. They laugh along with the jokes, not knowing they ARE the joke and not knowing..why. But overall, this film is about 'people'.

The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

We went to the movies a lot in those days! Would you say this review is positive or negative? Select from: (1). negative; (2). positive;","output":"The review given here seems to be somewhat neutral, leaning towards the negative. One should note that the tone of the review itself is casual, almost nostalgic, focusing more on the reviewer's personal anecdote and memories connected to the movie \\"Strangler of the Swamp\\" than on the critique of the movie itself. On one hand, the reviewer uses the term \\"routine\\" to describe the mystery/thriller, suggesting it's a typical or standard film of its genre, hinting at the lack of uniqueness or originality. The word \\"routine\\" might also imply that the movie was predictable, which is often viewed as a negative aspect especially in mystery or thriller movies where unexpected twists and turns play such a crucial role. On the other hand, the reviewer also mentions that the film was shown often during the early days of television, indicating its popularity or at least frequent presence back in the day. This could be interpreted in two ways - either the film was so widely broadcasted due to its success and quality, or it was one of the few production options available during the early days of television. The anecdote about the father sending the reviewer and their siblings to the movie theater whenever \\"Strangler of the Swamp\\" was on TV suggest a negative perception. The father probably did so because he didn't consider the film to be very worthwhile or engaging. This in itself could be interpreted as a veiled critique targeting the film, but it also could just be the father's personal preference rather than an accurate reflection of the film's quality. Based on the information provided in the review, it's hard to classify it as clearly positive or negative. However, by highlighting the film's predictability and the father's apparent lack of interest, the review gravitates more towards a negative perception. In conclusion, if a numerical rating isn't mandatory and a neutral judgement is acceptable here, we could say that this review is neutral-leaning-negative. But if a choice between positive and negative is required, it is probably best to qualify this review as (1) negative, bearing in mind that it's a rather mild and anecdotal form of negativity."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: Who was Prime Minister of Malta from 1955 to 1962 and again from 1971 to 1984?","output":"To answer this question about the Prime Minister of Malta, I need to first recall or look up historical information about Malta's political leaders.

Background on the Open Championship The Open Championship, also known as The British Open or simply The Open, is the oldest of the four major professional golf championships. First held in 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland, the event has grown into one of the most coveted titles in the golfing world. Played on a rotational basis across a selection of links courses in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, this major event offers a unique challenge to players due to its demanding course conditions and unpredictable weather patterns. Danny Willett's Rise to Fame Hailing from Sheffield, England, 28-year-old Danny Willett earned his breakthrough moment after clinching the green jacket at the 2016 Masters Tournament. This victory not only marked his first major championship, but also made him the first English golfer to win at Augusta National since Nick Faldo in 1996. Willett's immense talent and hardworking attitude have swiftly cemented his place amongst golf's elite and made him a fan favorite in his home country. Jason Day's Reign as World Number One Australian golf sensation Jason Day currently holds the coveted title of world number one, a position he first achieved in September 2015 after winning the BMW Championship. Today, Day has racked up a total of 12 PGA Tour titles, including his triumph at the 2015 PGA Championship. As a result, the 29-year-old Australian has established himself as a dominant force in men's golf, with an impressive record at the major championships and a burning desire to solidify his legacy. Rickie Fowler's Journey to Excellence A native of California, 28-year-old Rickie Fowler has been a consistent presence at the top of world golf for several years now. Bursting onto the scene in 2010 as the PGA Tour Rookie of the Year, Fowler has since captured four PGA Tour titles and six international victories. The charismatic golfer also notably captured the prestigious Players Championship in 2015. Although Fowler is yet to clinch his first major championship, his talent and dedication make him a serious contender at every event in which he participates. The Showdown at the 145th Open Championship With the stage set for an exhilarating first two rounds at the 145th Open Championship, golf enthusiasts can expect to witness some captivating golf from this trio of world-class players. Willett will be aiming to claim another major title on home soil, while Day looks to continue his reign as world number one and capture the coveted Claret Jug.

However, it doesn't entirely encapsulate everything that might happen to Lee in the context provided. 2. Not commended: There is no information in the context that suggests Lee would not be commended for his work. On the contrary, successfully dealing with a high-profile murder case could likely result in commendation or recognition for his efforts. 3. Praised for their hard work: This option seems the most plausible, considering the context. As a top lawyer who successfully handled and concluded a high-profile murder case, Lee is likely to receive praise for both his expertise and hard work. This would be a common response from those around Lee and a reasonable expectation given the information provided. Based on our analysis, the answer is: Lee will be praised for their hard work."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task you will be given an arithmetic operation and you have to find its answer.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Laurens wrote thesis against slavery","output":"Yes, the sentence does follow, given the preceding text about John Laurens. As an American soldier and statesman, Laurens was known for his criticism of slavery and efforts to encourage slaves to fight for their freedom as U.S. soldiers. This demonstrates that he held strong anti-slavery beliefs, and it would be reasonable to assume that he may have expressed these beliefs through written work, such as a thesis against slavery. John Laurens was born in Charleston, South Carolina, to a prominent slaveholding family. His father, Henry Laurens, was a wealthy plantation owner and merchant, as well as a leading figure in the American revolutionary movement. Despite his upbringing, John chose to pursue a different path and became a staunch abolitionist. He was educated in Europe, where his exposure to Enlightenment ideas likely contributed to his anti-slavery stance. In 1779, Laurens proposed a plan to the Continental Congress that would grant freedom to enslaved individuals who were willing to fight for the American cause. His proposal, known as the “Black Battalion Plan,” aimed to address the shortage of troops within the Continental Army and, at the same time, undermine Britain's labor-intensive plantation economy in the American South. Unfortunately, his proposal was met with strong opposition from Southern delegates, and it was ultimately rejected. Although the details of the thesis Laurens wrote against slavery are not provided in the initial sentence, it can be reasonably inferred that his written work would have reflected his abolitionist beliefs. His thesis likely presented arguments in opposition to the institution of slavery and may have proposed solutions for dismantling it. Furthermore, the fact that Laurens actively sought to recruit slaves to fight for their freedom as U.S. soldiers adds credibility to the idea that he would have also written a thesis against slavery. In conclusion, given John Laurens' known criticism of slavery and his efforts to help recruit slaves to fight for their freedom as U.S. soldiers, it does follow that he would have written a thesis against slavery. His anti-slavery activism was deeply rooted in his personal beliefs and endeavors, and expressing these convictions through a written work would have been a natural extension of his overall mission to challenge and confront the injustices of slavery."},{"instruction":"Choose the next sentence.James Roby made Castleford pay for his Super League Dream Team omission with a superb man-of-the-match performance that keeps St Helens on course for a place in the Grand Final.

Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Here are possible answers to this question: - barn - office - assembly line - museum - kitchen I believe the correct choice is \\"office\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"The copy machine is most likely to be found in an office. Here's a detailed explanation as to why, along with some considerations for the other locations on the list: 1. Office: Copy machines, also known as photocopiers or duplicators, are essential pieces of equipment in an office setting. They facilitate the reproduction of various documents and provide efficiency in the corporate environment, as well as in educational institutions and government offices. Photocopiers are an integral part of daily operations, from creating duplicates of important paperwork to making copies of meeting notes. Due to their convenient features of scanning, copying, and sometimes even printing documents, offices are the most probable locations for these machines. 2. Barn: A barn is primarily a structure used to house livestock, store agricultural equipment, and store harvested crops. It is a place where farmers work to maintain and manage their farm's operations. Given this focus on agriculture and the absence of office-related activities, copy machines are not likely to be found in a barn. 3. Assembly Line: An assembly line is a manufacturing method where workers and machines perform specific tasks on progressive units in a systematic manner. It is primarily used in factories and production plants to manufacture goods efficiently. While it is essential to incorporate modern technology and machines into this process, a copy machine is not a necessity in an assembly line, as its functions do not pertain to manufacturing procedures. 4. Museum: Museums are institutions that collect, curate, and display artifacts and objects of various types, from natural history to history, art, and science. The primary purpose of a museum is to educate and inform the public about different events, subjects, or items. While it is possible that a museum office may have a copy machine to reproduce administrative documents or educational materials, it is unlikely that the copy machine would be a central feature within the museum or its exhibition spaces. 5. Kitchen: A kitchen is a room or an area in a home or establishment that is designated for cooking and food preparation. It is a place where recipes, appliances, and culinary tools contribute to creating meals. Since a copy machine is unrelated to the functions associated with kitchens, it is improbable that one would find a photocopier in that environment. Given these factors, the correct choice remains \\"office\\" as the most likely place to find a copy machine. This setting benefits significantly from their use, while the alternative locations do not possess the appropriate context or necessity for housing a photocopier. Offices depend on the functionality and efficiency of a copy machine for smooth operations, rendering it an indispensable piece of equipment in the modern workspace."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored. The answer is:","output":"The answer is: The blood sugar levels drop or are low. Justification of the answer: 1. The blood sugar levels drop or are low: This is the initial event that triggers the entire process. When the body detects low blood sugar levels, it needs to restore them to maintain essential functions. 2. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon: The detection of low blood sugar levels stimulates specific cells in the pancreas, called alpha cells, to secrete the hormone glucagon. 3. The liver, in response, turns the glucagon into glucose: Glucagon acts on the liver to promote the conversion of glycogen (stored glucose) into glucose, which can be readily used by the body. 4. The liver releases glucose into the blood: The liver releases the newly formed glucose into the bloodstream to increase blood sugar levels. 5. Blood sugar levels are restored: As a result of these steps, blood sugar levels return to their normal range, ensuring the body has the necessary energy to function properly."},{"instruction":"Question: Which of these sentences doesn't make sense?

Movie title: Primary Colors Movie plot: Well acted drama, adapted from a novel by Joe Klein; has a terrific first half and then falters horribly in the final half hour- almost completely killing the entire movie. Travolta is dead-on as southern Governor Jack Stanton (a thinly veiled charicature of Bill Clinton), who is running for President. The film is shown from the perspective of a young, African-American man named Henry Burton, who is Stantons campaign manager. Through his eyes we spend intimate moments with the candidate, his wife and family and the various people working on his campaign. We also meet the other contenders for the office and get a rare inside glimpse of politics at work, which can be a ruthless and conniving game. Its fascinating material and the film hits the ground running, using a mostly good natured, humorous approach. The campaign must deal with the various and not unusual attacks by the opponents and must constantly dream up new strategies and schemes. Billy Bob Thornton is the man in charge of that department and he is all aces as Richard Jemmons, a ruthless, foul mouthed PR man. When even he cant refute some of the attacks on Stantons character (like an alleged affair with a hairdresser), Mrs. Stanton turns to Libby Holden (a terrific Kathy Bates). Libbys a quirky and unstable (shes been recently released from a mental hospital) defender of the Governor; whos reckless tactics actually get results. But she has a strict moral code that none of the others operate by. She will only go so far- and while she will defend attacks from other candidates she refuses to dig up dirt to attack another candidate first. It turns out that Governor Stanton is a genius player of the political game but also a tremendous philanderer who just may have had an affair with a 17 year old African-American girl and gotten her pregnant.

She was determined to find something that not only matched her needs but also her budget and lifestyle. After speaking with friends and family, doing extensive online research, and reading numerous reviews, Gina realized that there were multiple factors to consider while choosing her new car. Some of the aspects she prioritized were safety, fuel efficiency, price, reliability, and overall design. She began by browsing local dealerships' websites to see what was available. Gina also took the initiative to visit multiple dealerships in person so that she could test drive different makes and models. Throughout this process, Gina spoke with various salespeople to gather their opinions and recommendations. Taking note of what she liked and disliked about each car she test drove, Gina compiled a list of her top 5 contenders. These cars met all the requirements she had identified as important to her during her research. The list consisted of a mix of sedans, hatchbacks, and compact SUVs. Gina understood that it's crucial to compare quotes from different dealerships to ensure she's receiving the best possible deal. She contacted several dealerships, requesting price quotes for each of her top choices. While waiting for their responses, Gina continued her research by consulting consumer reports, reading more in-depth reviews from owners of these cars, and comparing various options and packages each model had to offer. Once she received the quotes, Gina analyzed the offers thoroughly. She wanted to make sure she understood the financing options, warranties, and extra features included in each offer. With this information in mind, Gina used her negotiation skills to receive a better deal on her preferred choice. Gina was down to two cars that seemed to meet all her requirements - a compact SUV and a fuel-efficient hatchback. To make her final decision, she reflected on her current needs and future plans.

Back in 1944, in the Jim Crow era of the South, Green Hill was known as \\"the black church\\", while Clarendon Baptist Church across the railway tracks was \\"the white church\\". Those who remember the terrible events that unfolded in this dot of a place that spring and summer were children at the time and their memories are shaped by this same racial divide that split the community in two. From the Green Hill church it is a few minutes' walk, across a ploughed field littered with corn husks, to the shallow ditch in the woods where the bodies of two girls, Betty June Binnicker, 11, and Mary Emma Thames, seven, were found, side by side, 70 years ago this month. Their murders stunned the townspeople, many of whom had taken part in a search for them the day before. The girls had been gathering flowers when they were followed, attacked and beaten so severely their skulls were fractured. The bodies of the girls, both white, were found on the black side of town. Suspicion quickly fell on a 14-year-old black boy named George Stinney Jr who, it emerged, had seen the girls the previous day. What happened next has cast a long shadow over the town, the state of South Carolina and the Stinney family. Police said that Stinney confessed to the crimes and, although there was no physical evidence, he was charged with capital murder, tried, convicted and executed by the state – all in the space of 83 days. He was the youngest person to be executed by the United States in the 20th century. His siblings, three of whom are still alive, believe his confession was coerced and he was a scapegoat for a white community seeking vengeance. Attorneys for George's sisters Aime Ruffner and Katherine Robinson and brother Charles have now launched a legal bid for the verdict to be overturned. They say they were with him when the murders occurred, evidence that was never presented at his trial. Other new evidence, heard by a court in January, includes an affidavit from the Reverend Francis Batson, who found the girls and pulled them from the water-filled ditch. In his statement he recalls there was not much blood in or around the ditch, suggesting that they may have been killed elsewhere and moved. Aime Ruffner, now 77, a widow and matriarch of three generations of Stinneys whose pictures line the walls of her three-storey clapboard house in Newark, New Jersey, said she has not returned to Alcolu since her father was sacked from his job at the mill and her family were run out of town the day her brother was taken away. \\"I never went back there. I curse that place. It was the destruction of my family and the killing of my brother.\\" She will never forget the last time she saw George alive. She was eight at the time, hunkering in the chicken coop, scared half to death, when two black cars drove up to their house. Neither her mother, also Aime, a cook, nor her father, George senior, were home when white law enforcement officers came and took away George and her stepbrother, Johnny, in handcuffs. Johnny was later let go. She idolised George and followed him everywhere. He called her his shadow. Though she left the south long ago, Aime's rich, deep voice resonates with the vowels of her birthplace. But recalling her last words to George, it alters as if she's gone back in time, to the high-pitched voice of a girl. \\"I said: 'Oh George, are you leaving me? Where you going?' He told me to find Charles and Katherine and tell them he was taken away. \\"I never saw him again until he was in his casket,\\" said Aime. \\"That is something I will always see in my memories. His face was burned.\\" There is scant documentary evidence from the case, but newspapers reported that, because of his small stature, at 5ft 1in and weighing just 95lb, the guards had difficultly strapping him into a chair built for adults. When the switch was flipped and the first 2,400 volts surged through his body, the too-large death mask slipped from his face revealing the tears falling from his scared, open eyes. A second and third charge followed. He was pronounced dead on 16 June 1944. Aime gets up from her doily-covered table where, before our interview, she had been conducting her day's business, writing cheques and paying bills, and goes to the living room to find photographs. A dog yaps in another room. The television is on, a family sitcom running. She emerges with a thick poster-size print, in which a black-and-white image of George's face, taken from his prison mug shot, is surrounded by purple fluffy clouds and the words: \\"George's place is here.\\" Another photograph shows him in a cap and an overly large jacket, the same serious look on his face. From the moment he was picked up until after his trial on 24 April, the child was not allowed to see his parents. He was alone throughout and faced a jury of 12 white men, who took less than 10 minutes to deliberate as a mob of up to 1,500 people surrounded the courtroom, according to reports. Aime's parents were allowed to visit their son only once, at Columbia penitentiary, after the trial. They returned, convinced of his innocence but, as poor blacks in the south, with little recourse. \\"My mother cried and prayed,\\" said Aime. \\"We wanted the truth to come out. But sometimes when you don't have the means and the money you accept things for what they are. The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People] tried to stop it, but it was no use. In those days, when you are white you were right, when you were black you were wrong.\\" Aime and her surviving siblings, Charles who was 12 and Katherine who was 10, grew up with two beliefs: that their brother was innocent and that they couldn't change the past. In legal documents submitted to the new hearing, Bishop Charles Stinney told of how the entire family were plunged into fear after George was taken and his father fired. Amid talk of a mob, they had to leave town for their grandmother's home in nearby Pinewood and later moved to Sumter. His parents were helpless, Charles said. \\"They had no money, the law was against them and they were black in the American south in 1944.\\" Lynchings were rare by the 1940s, but memories of southern vigilantism in the 1920s and earlier were bitter. One by one, the Stinney siblings moved north and settled in New York and Newark. They rarely spoke of what happened and have only recently given detailed testimony. Charles, 83, a widower with five grown-up children, left Sumter for the Air Force before becoming bishop of the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, in Brownsville, Brooklyn, one of New York's most deprived neighbourhoods. He has spent his life trying to put it all behind him, he said, to \\"stop opening old wounds\\". As a minister, he believes God knows the truth about his brother, a sociable boy who would get friends together to sing along to the radio in the yard. \\"Nothing will bring him back and nothing will bring those girls back,\\" he said. Nevertheless \\"It is important to have his name cleared.\\" Aime sought the help of an attorney and wrote a letter to Oprah Winfrey, she said. Both approaches went nowhere. The catalyst for the legal action came via George Frierson, a local historian and a member of Clarendon's School District Three's board of trustees, who was born in Alcolu and went to elementary school when the lumber yard was still running. Frierson began investigating the case in 2004 after a small piece in a local newspaper reminded him of it. Frierson said the more he researched, the more he became convinced by George's innocence. He says there was little blood at the ditch, evidence that the girls were killed elsewhere. \\"A 95lb boy can't carry two dead bodies a quarter mile or more. Those girls were beaten to a pulp. There would have been a lot of blood.\\" His work caught the interest of Steve McKenzie and Matt Burgess, white attorneys from Coffey, Chandler & McKenzie, who took on the case for the Stinney family. McKenzie filed papers at the county solicitor in October 2013 to ask to have George's verdict overturned. He, Burgess and Miller Shealy, a professor of criminal procedure at the Charleston School of Law, presented new evidence which included sworn statements by Charles and Aime that they were with George the day the girls went missing. Wilford \\"Johnny\\" Hunter, who was in prison with George, also testified that the teenager told him he had been made to confess. Aime says her story hasn't altered in 70 years, although at the hearing she was accused by prosecutors of not remembering details of a statement she had given in 2009. She said the events of 24 March 1944, when she and George came across the girls, were so clear in her mind because \\"no white people came around\\" to the black side of town. She and George were sitting on the railroad tracks when the girls approached and asked if they knew where they could find maypops, a kind of fruit. They answered no, she said, and they left. \\"We didn't see those girls no more. But somebody followed those girls and killed them.\\" She insists that George's confession was forced out of him. \\"They made him confess. They never found the statement. Why would my brother confess to something he didn't do?\\" The confession, if it was ever written down or signed, has not survived, along with the transcript of the trial. Attempts to overturn the conviction have met with resistance among Alcolu's white community. Sadie Duke told the local paper in January 2014 that the day before the murders, George had told her and a friend: \\"If you don't get away from here and if you ever come back, I will kill you.\\" Another local, who was 15 at the time, said George was known as a bully. Asked whether she recognised this version of her brother, Aime says: \\"The only white kids that came in our area was those kids. We had our own black school and church. We didn't fool around with white people.\\" Members of Alcolu's black community say that it was unlikely that, in the segregated town, any black child would threaten white children without there being repercussions. However, back in 1995, WL Hamilton, George's seventh grade teacher, who is black, told the Item newspaper that he had a temper and had got into a fight with a girl at school, scratching her with a knife. Aime said she phoned Hamilton after she read the story. \\"That bastard. That was a damn lie. When I heard about that lie Mr Hamilton told I called him up. I said my name is Aime Stinney and you said my brother was a bad boy. You've got one foot on a banana peel and the other going straight to hell.\\" Betty June Binnicker's family never moved too far from Alcolu. A few weeks ago Frankie Bailey Dyches, Betty June's niece, helped organise a gathering of family and acquaintances to counter what she said was a false impression of George Stinney. In a restaurant outside Manning, less than five miles away, Frankie and her cousin Carolyn Geddings talk about the case over the detritus of a southern lunch of fried chicken, prime ribs, rice and gravy. Dyches and Geddings, both 62, have grown up with the grief of their mothers, Betty June's elder sisters, and their grandparents Daisy and John Binnicker. To them, George's confession, and a handwritten note from a Clarendon County deputy stating he confessed and had led them to the murder weapon – a 15in railroad spike – was proof enough of his guilt. \\"It seems like a poor little black boy was railroaded by the white people, but that's not how it was,\\" said Dyches. \\"I'm 100% convinced he did it.\\" One of the investigating officers, Mr Pratt, had told her before he died never to doubt George's guilt. \\"The stories we hear are that he was a shy bashful boy, but he was a bully and he was mean,\\" she said, citing allegations by Duke and others. She questions the memories of the Stinney family, the motivation of the attorneys and the timing of the appeal. \\"Why now? What about in the 1960s, when the civil rights movement was starting? What about in the 1970s or 80s? One was a school teacher. It's not as though they weren't educated.\\" She believes the attorneys are motivated by money, citing a website they set up, and that they will sue the state for wrongful death if George is exonerated. The lawyers say the site is for litigation fees only, with any remaining going to a scholarship foundation, have no interest in suing for wrongful death and do not know if that is even possible. Betty's parents had already lost a baby son, Harold, when he was six months old and, after Betty June, lost a third child, a son who died on duty in the Korean war. According to the family they never recovered. Carolyn added: \\"For Betty June to be killed in such a horrible way – it was a terrible time for all of them.\\" The cousins insist that there was no racial element to George's trial and conviction. But they disagree over whether the state was right to execute him. \\"I'm a believer in the death penalty if you are 100% sure and I believe he did it,\\" said Frankie. Carolyn is more sympathetic to the view that grave mistakes were made in the case. She said George should have had a lawyer or parent with him during his interrogation, and should never have been put to death. \\"I feel bad for his family, all of them,\\" said Carolyn. \\"They had to live with it, same as we have. My mother, Vermelle, didn't think he should have been electrocuted. She thought because of his age that he shouldn't. At this point, after years of this, if the judge rules it wasn't fair then I'm happy with that. I hope the family can get some peace from it.\\" In the South CAROLINA state archives in Columbia, a thick file offers an insight into the outrage the upcoming execution of a minor caused at the time. Hundreds of letters and telegrams urged the governor, Olin Johnston, to commute the sentence to life imprisonment. Some cited a recent case, where a 16-year-old white boy from Parish Island was given a 20-year sentence for murder and rape. Others begged for a new investigation and trial. Many spoke of the war, in which black and white men were fighting and dying in equal numbers for their country. Johnston, who was running for the US Senate at the time, was unmoved. In one letter, dated 14 June, two days before the execution, Johnston wrote to a VM Ford of Myrtle Beach who had asked for clemency, that he had spoken with the arresting officer. He said: \\"It may be interesting for you to know that Stinney killed the smaller girl to rape the larger one. Then he killed the larger girl and raped her dead body. Twenty minutes later he returned and attempted to rape her again, but her body was too cold. All of this he admitted himself.\\" This was rumour – and was contradicted by the physical examination at postmortem. Johnston was not the only one running for office. Charles Plowden, George's appointed defence attorney, was also running for the statehouse. Two conflicting confessions by George were entered as evidence at the trial, according to reports. In the first, he said he was approached by the girls who attacked him after he tried to help one who had fallen into a ditch and he struck them in self-defence. In the second version, he had followed the girls into the woods and first attacked and fatally wounded Mary Emma, to \\"get her out of the way\\", and then chased Betty June and struck her. The trial court allowed the permissibility of the \\"possibility\\" of rape, despite the lack of evidence. The medical report states that, while there was slight swelling and a slight bruise on the external genitalia of Betty June, the hymens of both girls were intact. The attorney Matt Burgess believes George's confession was changed to fit the prosecution. \\"The confession changed to fit the elements. The murder weapon changed. It was a piece of iron, then a spike and then a railroad spike. That changed in a manner beneficial to law enforcement. In 1944, a 14-year-old black kid interrogated by white officers… They probably put different scenarios to him. I'm guessing he just said, 'Yes sir' a lot.\\" At Sumter County courthouse in January, Circuit Judge Carmen Mullen stressed that her job was not to establish the guilt or innocence of George Stinney, who \\"may well have committed this crime\\", but to determine whether or not he received a fair trial. She said: \\"No one can justify a 14-year-old child charged, tried, convicted and executed in some 80 days.\\" The injustices, she said, included a witness who discovered the victims' bodies being allowed to sit on the coroner's inquest; a trial that lasted less than a day; a state-appointed defence lawyer, Plowden, who did not call any witnesses, ask any questions on cross-examination, offered little or no defence and filed no appeal. Mullen concluded: \\"In essence, not much was done for this child when his life lay in the balance.\\" Her ruling is expected any day. The population of Alcolu has shrunk from 1,700 in 1944 to 400 today. Aime said she has no hate in her heart \\"for no man, even the ones that killed my brother. I feel sorry for the families that lost those little ones. They lost their children and I lost a brother. That hurts. But for people to sit down and form a judgment in the way they did? To electrocute him? They burned him. It was a horrible death for a child.\\" Summary:","output":"In 1944, 14-year-old George Stinney Jr. was charged with capital murder and executed by the state of South Carolina in just 83 days, making him the youngest person to be executed in the United States in the 20th century.

Which electron would be closer to the nucleus, cat A or cat B? Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D. Hint: As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England. Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below .

Do not generate anything else apart from one of the following characters: \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\". There is only one correct answer for each question. Input: Article: Remember that goals are dreams with a timetable. Our goals are important for us to create what enriches our life. A very common attitude among people who are successful is that their success lies in their ability to provide themselves goals that are both numerous and exciting. When you think about your future,you are helping to feed a long-term goal of what you want to create. To realize your dreams,you must translate your vision into a series of actions you can take as soon as possible. You should be able to measure these results,to make sure they take you wherever you want. And this step should not be viewed lightly! Indeed,very few people set goals and concrete actions for themselves to achieve. Very few people note what they want to accomplish,and know each day whether they have indeed advanced in the direction of their dreams. Therefore one of the secrets that you can get results from is to write down your goals on paper first. When you give your dreams a form,they become more concrete,and you can refer to them often and easily. Whenever you read the dreams that you note down,you fill your mind with positive and motivational thoughts. Unfortunately,many people stop there. They just simply make wishes, hope and wait. These people do not bring positive difference in their lives,because that sort of behavior is just wishful thinking. Success is not at all a miracle. It depends on clear and realistic targets through serious thoughts:concrete actions and perseverance . Don't forget,your past does not determine your future. Only you now is your potential!

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which town experienced fewer saturation phenomena? Hint: Specific humidity (or moisture content) is the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total mass of the moist air parcel.[13] Specific humidity is approximately equal to the mixing ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor in an air parcel to the mass of dry air for the same parcel. As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass. The answer is:","output":"Bend town experienced fewer saturation phenomena. Step 1: Understand the given information - Bend town has cooler air at night. - Bank town has warmer nights as it is situated on a south-facing hill. - As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation decreases. Step 2: Analyze the location and temperature of the towns - Bend town experiences cooler nights than Bank town, which implies it has a lower temperature at night. - Considering that both towns had a humid season, and the clue given that lower temperatures need less water vapor to reach saturation. Step 3: Determine which town experienced fewer saturation phenomena - Since Bend town has cooler nights, we can infer that it reaches the point of saturation with less water vapor content compared to Bank town, which has warmer nights. By following these steps, we can conclude that Bend town experienced fewer saturation phenomena due to its cooler night temperatures."},{"instruction":"Translate to Russian: This is a consequence of both the inheritance of the past - including that of the centrally-planned socialist economy - and, especially, the course taken by the system transformation over the past 15 or so years.","output":"Это результат и наследия прошлого - включая наследие централизованной социалистической экономики - и, особенно, пути преобразования системы за последние примерно 15 лет.

These two days make us think about the changing roles of mothers and fathers. More mothers now work outside the home. More fathers must help with child care. These two special days are celebrated in many different ways. On Mother's Day people wear carnations. A red one symbolizes a living mother. A white one shows that the mother is dead.

The pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously. The pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed. The pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region. One of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways. They are among the minority of the world’s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic. There are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) – plus a little red wine. Your fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily. Fish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals. Fruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily. Question: How long did it probably take the author to try to the Mediterranean diet?

This topic should be specific enough to make predictions, yet broad enough to have a larger significance. The topic I select is remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Step 2: Determine the focus within the topic Considering the broader topic of remote work during the pandemic, I narrow down our focus to understand its impact on work productivity levels. This focus enables us to come up with a testable hypothesis. Step 3: Identify variables In order to create a good hypothesis, it is important to identify variables that will be relevant to the research. In our case, the primary variables would be the remote work setup (independent variable) and the work productivity levels (dependent variable). Step 4: Formulate the hypothesis Now that the topic, focus, and variables have been identified, I will create a hypothesis that predicts the relationship between them. The hypothesis is a statement, and it can be supported or rejected through research. Hypothesis: Remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic has a positive impact on overall work productivity levels. This hypothesis would be tested through research studies by collecting data, analyzing information, and comparing it to pre-pandemic work productivity levels.

For a man who had just returned from an exhausting trip to the United States, he was animated and intellectually fizzing. No surprise, perhaps. America has played a formative role in the development of Brown the politician, and only hours before our interview he had been delivering a speech to both houses of Congress. For this particular PM, that is a bit like playing at Wembley. The most striking thing about Mr Brown's oratory to the Senate and the House of Representatives on Wednesday was the extent to which he looked utterly at home. When Tony Blair made his own speech there in July 2003, he lapped up the adulation like a rock star on tour. But Brown, more lyrical than usual, less wooden, even raising his hands like a pastor from the Deep South, performed like a prodigal son rather than a guest. Blair loved Europe long before he learnt to love the US. But Brown has always been besotted by the idea of America, by the dream of John Winthrop and Ronald Reagan of \\"a shining city upon the hill\\": a dream to which the PM referred directly in his speech. To my ears, the most striking and sonorous passage was the following: \\"For me this global recession is not to be measured just in statistics, or in graphs, or on a balance sheet. Instead I see one individual with one set of dreams and fears, and then another, and then another, each with their own stars to reach for, each part of a family, each at the heart of a community now in need of help and hope.\\" Just so. If only the Prime Minister would heed his own advice. During this recession, Mr Brown's greatest political problem has been his conspicuous failure to bridge the gap between the grand economic argument of summit and seminar room and the suffering of individuals and their families. In most of his pronouncements on the subject, the PM sounds more concerned to prove that he is right, and that his economic analysis is irreproachable, than to draw breath, descend from Mount Olympus for a minute, and address calmly and empathetically the anxieties and exasperation of the voters. Mr Brown is doubtless right that no strategic response to this downturn will achieve very much if it is not \\"global\\". But the word \\"global\\" and all the technocratic phrases the PM deploys mean precisely nothing to the housewife who is trying to make ends meet, to the homeowner worried that he will lose his home, or to the pensioner fretful about the future. Gordon treats the voters as if they were at a Cabinet Office away-day: it is all too forensic, too dry, too bloodless. This is why it matters that Mr Brown apologises in some shape or form for what has happened to the UK economy. There are other reasons, too. As long as he refuses to do so, the apology – or absence thereof – will be the story. In this context, George Osborne's speech in Birmingham on Friday was a crafty intervention, setting out in detail why, precisely, Gordon should say \\"sorry\\" for the failures of the financial regulation system he established and for Britain's addiction to debt. Secondly, the issue has become yet another emblem of the various rifts within the Cabinet. On Tuesday, Alistair Darling told The Daily Telegraph that \\"all of us have to have the humility to accept that over the last few years, things got out of alignment\\". Then another notional ally of the PM, Ed Balls, stormed in with his own nostra culpa: \\"We underestimated the risks, we weren't tough enough.\\" This public prodding from senior colleagues could scarcely be clearer. They want their boss to go further, faster and – above all – this time with feeling. The best Gordon could manage when interviewed by Nick Robinson on the Today programme last week was to offer a platitudinous observation about apologies as a genre. \\"I think it's very important,\\" said Brown, \\"to recognise that where mistakes have been made you've got to say, 'You know, this is a mistake'.\\" Yes, Prime Minister. There was a truly toe-curling moment in his speech to the Scottish Labour conference on Friday. \\"And I'm sorry I couldn't bring Barack Obama back with me to Dundee,\\" said Brown, in appallingly kittenish mood, \\"though he will be with me and the other G20 leaders in London next month.\\" The idea of the President of the United States as a sort of travelling good-luck charm – I always assumed that Gordon had a lucky vest, or something similar – is too embarrassing to dwell upon. But the remark was not entirely frivolous: Brown really has invested extraordinary hopes in the G20 summit in April as one of the defining geopolitical gatherings of our time, and one that will significantly boost his own chances of electoral revival. Here's how much difference the G20 will have on Gordon's prospects at the next general election: nada. Nichts. Nul Points. Zip. Bugger all. Whatever its intrinsic merits, its potential triumphs of negotiation and its success as an exercise in the spectacle and choreography of collaborative power, the G20 is – almost by definition – an event that cannot speak to those whose financial pain will be the true backdrop to all its deliberations. Political pageantry can be immensely moving, but timing and context are all. And pageantry doesn't count for much at a time when the voters' horizons are shrinking, their field of vision narrowing bleakly to the here and now, to making ends meet, to cancelling family holidays this year, to fearing that their homes will be repossessed. Precisely at the moment that Gordon's vistas are broadening as never before, to the point that he can address Congress itself with poise and confidence, the very opposite is happening to the voters who will decide his fate. Now more than ever, their political vista begins and ends at the kitchen table and the bills spread across it. They don't want to hear jokes about bringing Obama back home like a souvenir. They don't care much, if at all, whether London is hosting a big summit. They are suffering financially and they want to know who is going to do something about it. That's all. This is the real reason that Brown must say sorry: not in order to subject himself to some abject humiliation or for profoundly moral and theological reasons. The apology that is required is not penitence on bended knee, but an outstretched hand: \\"Most of these things happened on my watch in my 10 years as Chancellor. I am sorry that you are suffering financially and I am sorry for my part in that. I wish I could have done more to prevent it. Now I seek your trust so I can repair the damage and prevent it ever happening again.\\" Not so awful, is it, Gordon? Since American history has such a persuasive power over this Prime Minister, let me remind him of what Truman's vice-president, Alben W Barkley, said of political apologies: \\"If you have to eat crow, eat it while it's hot.\\" Sage words from Kentucky. And I'd get chewing if I were you, Gordon. This particular crow is getting cold mighty fast. Matthew d'Ancona is Editor of 'The Spectator' What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article stresses the necessity for former UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, to apologize for the condition of the UK economy during the global recession, and to demonstrate empathy for the people who have suffered because of it. Key points from the article include: 1. Brown was known for his admiration of America and was praised for his oratory skills while addressing both houses of Congress during a visit to the United States. 2. The author believes Brown failed to bridge the gap between grand economic arguments and the suffering of individuals, often appearing more concerned with his economic analysis than connecting with the anxieties of the voters. 3. Brown's reluctance to apologize for the economy became a point of tension within the Cabinet. 4. The G20 summit, which Brown invested hopes in, is considered to have little impact on his electoral revival prospects. 5. The article calls for Brown to apologize for his part in the UK's economic struggles — not as an abject humiliation, but as a sincere acknowledgment of his role and as a gesture of seeking trust for fixing the situation. Ultimately, the article highlights the need for empathetic leadership in times of crisis and the importance of personal connections with the people affected."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Terry: dad, forgot my pills Greg: All of them?

Reasoning: Terry needs to let Greg know there is an issue with their medication. 2. Greg asks Terry if they forgot all of their pills, trying to clarify the situation and determine the extent of the issue. Reasoning: Greg wants to understand the problem better so he can help Terry. 3. Terry specifies that they only forgot the yellow pill, which is for their stomach.

She's now a fashion powerhouse who has forged an identity all her own. Marie Claire's Kimberly Cutter gets an up-close look at the intensely private star, goes inside the studio of her label, The Row, and looks back at her anything-but-ordinary upbringing in our latest issue, on sale at newsstands now. Often seen yet rarely heard, Mary-Kate's cover shoot at The Inn in Quogue, New York, sets the sartorial tone  she wears a mash-up of designers, from her own leather jacket to mainstays like Valentino and Catherine Malandrino to newcomer Christopher Kane  and a humorous one, with an antler headband. Go behind the scenes of Mary-Kate's Marie Claire cover shoot in the Hamptons. Outside of the spotlight, the 24-year-old bohemian star loves designing for her mix of labels  from The Row to her and Ashley's lower-priced Olsenboye line for JCPenney  because \\"it's kind of like a mask to hide behind.\\" In fact, Mary-Kate likens her and her sister to \\"little monkey performers\\" when referencing her childhood in front of the cameras: \\"I look at old photos of me, and I don't feel connected to them at all I would never wish my upbringing on anyone \\" See the exclusive photos from Mary-Kate's September issue spread. And when the topics turn to her tabloid-plastered problems with an eating disorder (she entered treatment for one in 2004) and with a hard-partying lifestyle (including her time with the late Heath Ledger), she only says that she's learned to seek help when she needs it: \\"I think it's really important to be able to talk when something's wrong. I learned at a really young age that if you don't talk about it, it can drive you insane.\\" Her focus right now, as Cutter writes, is all to do with fashion. From the inception of The Row to their early successes  \\"It took us a year-and-a-half to make the first T-shirt,\\" she says  Mary-Kate takes it more seriously than anything else: \\"I still read scripts, and if something great comes along, that's great but this is my day job.

Question: Navy flags often include red because the color symbolizes what? Context: Red is one of the most common colors used on national flags. The use of red has similar connotations from country to country: the blood, sacrifice, and courage of those who defended their country; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings; and the sacrifice of Christ's blood (in some historically Christian nations) are a few examples. Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the former British Empire. The British flag bears the colors red, white, and blue; it includes the cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, and the saltire of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white. The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country. Many former colonies of Spain, such as Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Peru, and Venezuela, also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners. Red flags are also used to symbolize storms, bad water conditions, and many other dangers. Navy flags are often red and yellow. Red is prominently featured in the flag of the United States Marine Corps. Answer:","output":"Navy flags often include red because the color symbolizes the blood, sacrifice, and courage of those who defended their country."},{"instruction":"Use stream of consciousness to answer the following.

Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Nicolas-Henri Jardin (22 March 1720 31 August 1799), neoclassical architect, was born in St. Germain des Noyers, Dept.

In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals. - Arable land (from Latin \\"arabilis\\", \\"able to be plowed\\") is, according to one definition, land \\"capable\\" of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable lands such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland. - Aarhus (officially spelled Århus from 1948 until 31 December 2010) is the second-largest city in Denmark and the seat of Aarhus municipality.

The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Nyborg is a city in central Denmark, located in Nyborg Municipality on the island of Funen and with a population of 16,528 (as of 1 January 2014).

In modern England and Wales it is recognised as a form of property, one of three elements of a manor that may exist separately or be combined and may be held in moieties: - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries. - Glorup is a manor house located between Nyborg and Svendborg in the south - east of the Danish island Funen .

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands). - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial based on feudal responsibilities and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - Svendborg is a town on the island of Funen in south-central Denmark, and the seat of Svendborg Municipality.

Thomas de Maiziere expressed \\"great concern\\" over the fact that about 50,000 Albanians have asked for asylum in Germany this year, coming second only to Syrian refugees. During a visit to Albania Friday, he said Albanians migrate to Germany to seek jobs and improve their living standards. De Maiziere said all requests would be denied in a faster, three-week process, after Albania was included in a list of safe countries. \\"There is no reason for Albanians to ask for political asylum,\\" he said.\\" Their country is democratic.\\" ___ 4:45 p.m. Greek authorities say the bodies of five more migrants have been found in the eastern Aegean Sea, which hundreds of thousands have crossed in frail boats this year seeking a better life in Europe. The coast guard said Friday that three men and a woman were found dead over the past two days in the sea off Lesbos. The eastern island is where most of the migrants head from the nearby Turkish coast, paying large sums to smugglers for a berth on overcrowded, unseaworthy vessels. The body of another man was found Thursday off the islet of Agathonissi. Well over half a million people have reached the Greek islands so far this year — a record number of arrivals — and the journey has proved fatal for hundreds. ___ 3:35 p.m. The Spanish government said Friday it expects a first group of 19 refugees to arrive in Madrid on Sunday from Italy as part of a European Union relocation program. Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria told reporters the group comprised mostly Eritreans and included many women. She said the 19 are part of a group of 50 refugees due to come for relocation. She added that the government has approved plans for the resettlement in Spain this year of 854 refugees in countries bordering Syria. She said this is part of plans for Spain to accept 1,449 refugees over the next two years under the EU resettlement program. ___ 1:35 p.m. France is busing asylum-seekers from elsewhere in Europe to small towns in the French heartland, after months of criticism that French authorities weren't doing their share to take in refugees and other migrants pouring into Europe this year. The Interior Ministry said in a statement that 18 men and one woman who fled Eritrea are being bused Friday from Italy to the Loire Valley region in western France. They are among 200 people France is taking from Italy and Greece this month, 300 next month and 400 in January, the statement said. France has agreed to take in 30,000 refugees from around Europe as part of EU-wide agreements — compared with hundreds of thousands in neighboring Germany, and 4 million Syrian refugees taken in by Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. ___ 12:20 p.m. They call her Nina, but no one knows her real name, where she came from or what language she speaks. Authorities have been struggling to find out the identity of a small girl found in park in a Croatian town a month ago, believed to be a refugee who got lost in a tide of people passing through the country toward Western Europe. Officials have invited media to take pictures of the girl, who is about three years old, in the capital of Zagreb to help locate her parents. She was found in the central town of Velika Gorica. Croatia's Minister of Family Milanka Opacic says \\"we have been unable to figure out what language the child speaks.\\" More than 330,000 asylum-seekers have entered Croatia since mid-September, many of them families with small children. ___ 11:55 a.m. Thousands of refugees and other migrants are heading to the Greek mainland from the eastern Aegean islands after the country's seamen's union called off rolling 48-hour ferry strikes. The strike, which began Monday, had stranded an estimated 25,000 people on the islands. Ferries began operating again Friday morning. Several ships dedicated to refugees set sail from the islands of Lesbos and Chios, while others were taking ships from other islands on the regular passenger ferry service. The ferries are heading to Greece's main port of Piraeus near Athens and the northern port cities of Thessaloniki and Kavala. More than 600,000 people have reached Greece from Turkey so far this year. The vast majority don't want to stay, and head north through the Balkans to other, more prosperous European Union countries. ___ 11:50 a.m. Police say they have arrested two Albanians and a Turk on smuggling charges for arranging for Turkish citizens to get into European Union countries without visas through Albania. Police said in a statement Friday that the three were arrested at Tirana airport. They are accused of helping Turkish citizens, who need no visa to enter Albania, move on to Montenegro, Serbia and Hungary as a means of making their way to other EU countries. They allegedly charged 3,600 euros (3,900) per person. The three face up to 10 years' imprisonment if found guilty. Albania is not on the route of refugees and migrants from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries heading to the European Union. The main route is from Turkey to Greek islands, then north through Macedonia and Serbia toward other EU nations. The government says, however, it has made preparations to shelter refugees should they begin arriving in Albania during the winter. ___ 11:30 a.m. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has invited mayors of eastern Aegean islands bearing the brunt of the current refugee influx to Athens for an emergency meeting on how to deal with the crisis. The meeting, scheduled for midday Friday, was also to be attended by the north and south Aegean regional governors as well as mayors and religious officials from the islands of Lesbos, Samos, Kos, Leros and Chios, and government officials. Greece is the main gateway into the European Union for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty at home. The vast majority arrive after a short but dangerous sea journey to Greek islands from the nearby Turkish coast and then head to the mainland and on to more prosperous northern EU countries through the Balkans. Hundreds have drowned, including many children, when their overcrowded and unseaworthy boats have sunk or capsized. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A three-year-old girl, known only as Nina, was found in a park in Velika Gorica, Croatia a month ago, and authorities believe she may have become lost in the tide of people fleeing Syria for a better life in Western Europe.

Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post. Brendan Gill, the former executive director of the Bexar County group, said he has since come to see the merger as a positive move for South Texas. \\"I always knew there were good points to merging, just as I knew that there were bad points,\\" Gill said.

The focus is on affordability and suitability for beginners.

While it does not explicitly mention the budget aspect, it considers the needs and requirements of a new knife maker. Now, I will compare the meanings of the two questions: Both questions focus on belt grinder recommendations for beginner knife makers, so their subject matter is quite similar.

Tom Rui, 14: We helped clean the yard in the front of a hospital, but some patients there left us a very bad impression . They were very impolite and shouted at nurses and doctors. I think nurses and doctors' work is hard. They try their best to help us. We should give them more respect and understanding.

Question: When did Zahm die? Context: Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.

Choices: - feel lonely - graduate from high school - enter college - cross street - be alone The rationale to choose \\"feel lonely\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Feeling lonely is the most appropriate answer among the given choices because it directly relates to the emotional and psychological state a person may experience when they are deprived of the company of others. Loneliness is a complex emotional response to isolation, wherein the individual's need for social interaction is unmet. With no one around them, a person may feel disconnected, neglected or uncared for, leading to them feeling lonely. Graduation from high school and entering college are milestones in a person's life that occur irrespective of whether or not they are surrounded by others. Although having a community or a support system may influence their academic experiences, these events are not dependent on the direct presence of other people. Graduation and entering college are results of a person's academic progress and not directly correlated with their social interactions. Similarly, crossing a street is a simple, daily action that can be performed without the need for others. While it may be safer, easier, or preferable to cross the street with others around, it's entirely possible for a person to perform this action independently. The presence of others does not significantly impact this activity. The choice \\"be alone\\" is not the best answer, as it only describes the physical state of the person, not necessarily the emotional impact of being alone. It is possible for an individual to be alone without feeling lonely, for instance in situations where they prefer solitude or need personal space. Being alone does not automatically result in loneliness. Therefore, among the given options, \\"feel lonely\\" is the most appropriate answer when considering the emotional and psychological ramifications of being without the company of other people. The experience of being alone without a support system or human connection can lead to significant feelings of loneliness, negatively impacting a person's mental health and overall wellbeing."},{"instruction":"Peter: Hi!

Smartphones do make our lives easier . But have you ever thought about what they mean to your eyes? According to a study, half of British people own smartphones and they spend an average of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the UK who suffer from shortsightedness since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring at smartphones for long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink a certain number of times. However, when you look at things closer to your face, the blinking slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes. Another bad habit is using smartphones in dark rooms before going to sleep. If you look at a bright screen while your pupils become larger, too much light enters your eyes. This can do harm to the eyes and cause a disease called glaucoma . While you're probably not going to stop using to your _ , there are a few things you can do to protect your eyes.

A dilapidated school where pupils were forced to have lessons in the corridor because of the decaying classrooms is still in a state of disrepair one year on. Teachers at Richard Lee Primary School, in Wyken, Coventry, have told how nothing has changed. One one occasion in the last twelve months, a corridor was turned into a river after blocked and cracked storm drains overflowed. Bleak outlook: Pupils Georgia Diston and Harvey Billing have to resort to holding an umbrella at Richard Lee Primary School in Coventry because there are so many leaks in their dilapidated classroom. Disrepair: After class, the two youngsters have to then walk along crumbling corridors, one of which became a river when a cracked storm drain overflowed. And in the last two weeks, six leaks have sprung up in classroom roofs, forcing the children to hold umbrellas during lessons. It all adds to a tale of woe at the 509-pupil school - soon to increase to 700 students in September - that includes crumbling walls, moldy carpets, drafty doors, cracked windows, collapsing roofs and freezing classrooms. When Nick Gibb, minister of state for schools, visited he dubbed the conditions the worst he has ever seen. Mr Gibb added: 'I would be very cross about the standard of the building if I was a parent with children at the school. This is clearly a very poor building that was built in the 1950s and needs work. Patch job: Headteacher Nicola Harwood in one of the out-of-bounds classrooms, which have sprung six leaks in the last two weeks. Expensive: Mrs Harwood looks up at one of the large leaks in the corridor. She believes it will revealed that it would cost upwards of £1million to bring the school up to standard. 'Children failed': Schools Minister Nick Gibb (pictured) said they were the worst conditions he had ever seen when he visited the school this week. The run-down primary school hit the. headlines last year when four and five-year-olds were forced to have. lessons in a corridor after their classroom was flooded by a faulty. boiler. And just five months later part of a roof collapsed - again forcing kids out of their classroom. Pupils,. teachers and parents have since campaigned for a rebuild - even taking. their fight to Downing Street and the Department for Education in July. Their. protests prompted a visit from Mr Gibb yesterday, where the minister. praised staff in keeping teaching standards at the school high, even. when the facilities were not. He. said: 'This is a school focused on making sure that children improve. their reading and arithmetic, despite the problems that they labour. under.' The school is now part of seven in Coventry bidding for funding as part of the Priority Schools Building Programme. But headteacher Nicola Harwood said: 'We will have to wait and see if funding materialises. Hopefully our school will be at the top of the list to receive money or a rebuild. Frustrated: Mrs Harwood, pointing out a crack in the food store cupboard, is desperately hoping for funding to materialise before conditions get any worse. 'Children failed': Schools Minister Nick Gibb (pictured) said they were the worst conditions he had ever seen when he visited the school this week. 'For now we will have to keep patching up the school and continue to make sure Richard Lee is fit for purpose.' Nicola revealed that it would cost. upwards of £1million to bring the school up to standard - including a. £40,000 boiler system and £25,000 to install new doors and windows. throughout. The headteacher added: 'Since last year when we moved classes into a corridor, that has been flooded by broken storm drains overflowing. 'It was like a river running down the corridor. We are running out of rooms which don’t have anything wrong with them to be honest. 'It meant we had to take classes into the main hall, which is not ideal. 'I think there are issues over funding for schools. They need to do surveys to make sure schools don’t get to the stage we are at again. 'The most frustrating thing is that the decision on who will receive money keeps on being put back. 'It could be another year before we see any change but I am very optimistic and the minister had nothing but good things to say about the level of teaching. Coventry MP Bob Ainsworth, who has raised the school's plight in parliament, said: 'We made sure the schools minister was aware of the really shocking state of the building and he said it was the worst he had seen. 'I knew that if he came he would be shocked and all we can hope for is that it puts Richard Lee at the centre of minds when it comes to deciding funding allocations for the Priority Schools Building Programme.' Highlights:","output":"- Richard Lee Primary School has old and broken classrooms and is in bad shape. - The school has leaks, mold, and broken windows, and it's hard to learn in. - The school needs lots of money to fix all the problems and make it a good place to learn. - People are trying to get the government to give the school money to fix everything."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Keynoting the Southern Republican Leadership Conference Thursday night, Gingrich used his nearly hour-long address to alternatively slam Pres. Obama while laying out his own vision for the future of the GOP. \\"What the left wants to do is to say we're the 'Party of No,'\\" Gingrich said. \\"I think we should decide we're going to be the party of yes.\\" Gingrich urged SRLC attendees to advocate for common GOP principles that closely mirror the '94 Contract with America. He said the GOP supports balanced budgets, tight controls on spending and what he called \\"the right kind\\" of health care reform. \\"There are many things that we can say yes to,\\" he said. \\"Our first answer should be, 'Let me tell you what I'm for,' and the answer should be first principles.\\" The long-time leader of the GOP's intellectual wing still offers pointed barbs at an admin he sees as \\"the most radical\\" in the nation's history. \\"This is going to be, in economic terms, the worst administration since Herbert Hoover,\\" he said. He offered bullets on his resume intermittently throughout his speech, reminding activists of his central role in crafting the GOP's return to the majority for the first time in 40 years -- and his role in re-electing the first GOP majority in 64 years. His experience will play a role in the GOP's strategy to roll back the health care overhaul. But he spent a chunk of the time discussing the conversation he wants to have with conservatives and Americans over the next three years. \\"I used to be Speaker of the House and I actually understand the legislative process,\\" he said. The \\"repeal and replace\\" message, he noted, might not succeed in '11 -- as Dems have said -- but he said that with a GOP president and a GOP Congress in '13, they will repeal all the \\"radical\\" legislation Obama has gotten through. And given the reaction he's received, it's clear Gingrich will be a major player. He retains an almost cult following among conservative activists. At the SRLC, as he did earlier this year at the Conservative Political Action Committee, he entered from the back of the hall to the '80s power ballad \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" instead of from behind the podium, reveling in the crush of supporters. But major speeches to conservative activists aren't Gingrich's only forays into the WH'12 water. Before delivering his keynote address, Gingrich hosted his fifth campaign-style town hall event at a nearby hotel. He also met with a group of small business owners to hear their concerns over a sagging economy. He has considered running for the WH before, but demurred. This time, Gingrich told an audience member he believes he and his wife will decide whether to make a WH bid in '11. \\"That'll [be up to] God and the American people,\\" he said. If he decides to run, he'll have a fan base. After one event, local Tea Party leader Evan Spiceland said that Gingrich has always been the smartest of the GOP field, and that the rest have to sell themselves to activists. Before his SRLC address, several attendees expressed admiration for ex-AK Gov. Sarah Palin (R), but said they backed Gingrich because he was a more complete package. ||||| AP NEW ORLEANS -- Newt Gingrich made a rock star's entrance at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference Thursday night, entering to a standing ovation as the song \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" blared over the speakers and lights shined out over the crowd. When Gingrich eventually got to the podium, he delivered a self-assured address peppered with historical allusions. Democrats in Washington, he said, had put together a \\"perfect unrepresentative left-wing machine dedicated to a secular socialist future.\\" Mr. Obama is \\"the most radical president in American history,\\" Gingrich said. \\"He has said, 'I run a machine, I own Washington, and there is nothing you can do about it.'\\" \\"What we need is a president, not an athlete,\\" Gingrich said during a question and answer period after his speech. He added: \\"Shooting three point shots may be clever, but it doesn't put anybody to work.\\" Gingrich discussed passage of the health care bill, saying the \\"decisive\\" election of Sen. Scott Brown sent a message that Democrats decided to ignore in order to \\"ram through\\" the bill against the wishes of the American people. \\"The longer Obama talks the less the American people believe him,\\" Gingrich said, citing the decline in poll numbers for the health care bill as the president kept trying to sell it to the public. Gingrich said that when Republicans take back the House and Senate in the midterm elections they should \\"refuse to fund\\" the administration's proposals, drawing huge applause from the crowd. Add a Republican president, he said, and the goal should be to \\"repeal every radical bill\\" passed by the current administration. Gingrich, a potential 2012 Republican presidential candidate, stressed his conception of the current administration as part of \\"secular, socialist machine.\\" \\"On every front,\\" he said, \\"they're increasing government\\" and trying to \\"micromanage our lives,\\" raise taxes, increase government power and strip citizens of their power. \\"This is a fundamental fight over the core definition of America,\\" Gingrich said. He told the crowd they should be talking about culture, not politics. \\"The more we make this a choice about the nature of America, the weaker they are,\\" he said. Gingrich told a story about the Polish people when they were resisting communism, who he said came up with the slogan, \\"two plus two equals four,\\" taking it from the writings of Albert Camus and George Orwell. He said the slogan grew from the fact that the authorities can't handle the truth, tying it to what he suggested were nonsensical numbers offered by Democrats about the health care bill. \\"There are more of us than there are of the government,\\" the former House speaker said, midway through his story about Polish resistance to communism. \\"So why are we afraid of them?\\" Asked if he would run for president, he said he would make a decision in February 2011. He said for the moment it was important for Republicans to \\"get out and campaign this year to win this year's election.\\" The left, Gingrich said, wants \\"to be dishonest about who we are\\" and cast Republicans as \\"the party of no.\\" He said the GOP needs to be the party of yes -- by saying yes to a balanced budget through controlled spending, more jobs through tax cuts, reforming government, stopping people from stealing from Medicaid and Medicare, spending more on getting soldiers better equipment, and \\"the right kind of health reform\\" and energy plan. \\"My point is, there are many things that we can say yes to, and if we would discipline ourselves to start off every conversation with...'let me tell you what I'm for,'\\" Gingrich said, Republicans will be on the right track. Gingrich predicted that \\"this administration is going to be a catastrophic failure,\\" deeming it the worst since Herbert Hoover from an economic perspective. He pushed for small business tax cuts over government spending, \\"Quite frankly, I'm tired of finding new ways to help people who aren't working, I want to find new ways to help people who are working,\\" he said. Gingrich said Americans will choose Republicans in the coming elections if Republicans can frame the discussion between what they offer and what is offered by Democrats. He said President Obama had helped set the stage for a comeback with his \\"incompetence.\\" The debate should be framed, he said, not as \\"Obama vs. Anti-Obama, but America vs. a secular socialist machine.\\" More Coverage from the Southern Republican Leadership Conference: Sarah Palin Fires Back at Obama, Mocks His \\"Experience\\" on Nuclear Issues Jindal Jokes RNC Staffers Should Avoid Bourbon Street Is This How Straw Polls are won? \\"Evangelicals for Mitt\\" Step Into Romney Vacuum Liz Cheney: Obama Putting America on Path to Decline All Hotsheet Coverage of the SRLC ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich made an energetic appearance at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference, positioning himself as a potential 2021 White House contender. Gingrich delivered a keynote address, using the opportunity to criticize President Obama and share his vision for the GOP's future. Gingrich took aim at the Obama administration, which he labelled as \\"the most radical\\" in history, comparing its economic impact unfavourably to Herbert Hoover's administration. He offered his perspective for a GOP-led future, focused on principles akin to the '94 Contract with America, including balanced budgets, tight spending controls and what he referred to as \\"the right kind\\" of health care reform. At his appearance, he advocated for the GOP to position itself as a 'party of yes', emphasizing its support for aforementioned principles. He pledged that under a GOP president and Congress, all \\"radical\\" legislation passed under Obama would be repudiated. Gingrich also hosted a town hall event and met with a group of small business owners to address their economic concerns. Though he had considered running for Presidency before but decided against it, he indicated to an audience member that he might make another bid for the White House. Supporters at the event, including the local Tea Party leader, voiced their admiration and support for Gingrich. The former House Speaker also outlined his perception of the Obama administration as part of a \\"secular, socialist machine\\", suggesting that it was working to increase government power, raise taxes and strip citizens of their autonomy. He emphasized that the ongoing political battle is fundamentally about defending the core principles of America. Ultimately, Gingrich predicted the failure of the Obama administration and urged Republicans to frame the debate not as \\"Obama vs. Anti-Obama, but America vs. a secular socialist machine\\". Overall, Gingrich used the conference to make a strong case for Republican values, champion conservative ideologies, and lay the groundwork for a potential presidential campaign."},{"instruction":"Continue the following story.

What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"This sentence provides valuable information about the Alhambra ship, specifically its beam width and top speed. By analyzing these details, we can gain a deeper understanding of the ship's design, dimensions, and performance capabilities. 1. Beam width: The Alhambra ship has a beam width of 8.3 meters. The beam of a ship refers to the width of the vessel at its widest point. This measurement is a crucial aspect of the ship's design, as it affects the overall stability, maneuverability, and capacity. A wider beam generally implies a more stable and roomier ship, while a narrower beam may allow for a sleeker design and higher speeds. 2. Top speed: The Alhambra ship can reach a top speed of 18.52 knots. This piece of information is essential for understanding the vessel's performance capabilities and determining its suitability for different kinds of missions or transportation purposes. Factors such as the ship's hull design, propulsion system, and overall displacement contribute to its top speed. Further data analysis and implications: Based on this information, several inferences can be made about other aspects related to the Alhambra ship. A. Type and purpose of the ship: The dimensions and speed mentioned in the sentence can provide clues about the ship's classification and intended use. For instance, the given beam width and top speed might indicate that the Alhambra is a relatively smaller and agile vessel. This could suggest that it is more suitable for coastal patrol, tourism, or short-range transportation. B. Hull design and stability: A ship with an 8.3-meter beam is likely to have a fairly shallow draft, meaning it can navigate through shallow waters or access ports that may not be accessible to larger vessels. Additionally, the stability provided by the beam width allows the ship to maintain its course and balance even in rough sea conditions. C. Engine and propulsion system: To achieve a top speed of 18.52 knots, the Alhambra ship must have a powerful propulsion system. This could include multiple engines or advanced propeller designs that contribute to the vessel's efficiency and speed capabilities. D. Passenger and cargo capacity: The ship's beam width can provide an indication of its overall size and, therefore, the amount of passenger and cargo space available on board. Although exact dimensions and capacities of the Alhambra ship are not provided in the sentence, a wider beam may suggest more space on board compared to ships with a narrower beam of similar length. E. Operational Costs and Efficiency: Other factors such as fuel consumption, maintenance, and crew requirements can be indirectly inferred based on the ship's speed and dimensions. Generally, smaller and faster vessels may require less fuel and maintenance compared to larger, slower ships. However, other design and technological features can also impact the operational efficiency of the vessel. In conclusion, the given sentence provides essential data on the Alhambra ship's beam width and top speed. These details can be further analyzed to develop a deeper understanding of the vessel's design, performance, stability, and functionality. Additional research and information would help to paint a more comprehensive picture of the Alhambra ship's overall capabilities, purpose, and potential applications."},{"instruction":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","output":"Question: What are the primary functions of the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells? Detailed answer: Mitochondria, often referred to as the \\"powerhouses\\" of the cell, are critical organelles within eukaryotic cells that serve several essential functions, the most notable of which is the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through cellular respiration. In addition to generating ATP, mitochondria also play a crucial role in several other cellular processes: 1. Energy production: Through a complex process known as oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria convert nutrients, such as glucose and fatty acids, into ATP. ATP serves as an energy \\"currency\\" that cells can use to perform various functions, including protein synthesis, DNA replication, and transportation of molecules across cellular membranes. 2. Calcium regulation: Mitochondria help maintain the optimal concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) within the cell. Ca2+ ions are essential for proper cellular functions, such as signal transduction, muscle contraction, and neurotransmitter release. 3. Fatty acid metabolism: Mitochondria are responsible for the breakdown of long-chain fatty acids through a process called beta-oxidation. This process generates energy in the form of ATP and provides acetyl-CoA molecules required for the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle). 4. Apoptosis regulation: Mitochondria play a vital role in regulating programmed cell death, or apoptosis. When cellular damage occurs due to stress, aging, or other factors, mitochondria can release several pro-apoptotic factors – such as cytochrome c – into the cell cytoplasm, activating specific pathways that lead to the cell's demise. 5. Heat production: Some cells, especially those in brown adipose tissue, can generate heat through a process known as non-shivering thermogenesis. Within these cells, mitochondria uncouple the ATP production process from oxidative phosphorylation, allowing energy to dissipate as heat instead of being captured in ATP molecules. This process is vital for maintaining body temperature in mammals. 6. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production: Mitochondria generate ROS, such as superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, as byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation. While ROS can cause cellular damage, they also serve essential functions in cell signaling and immune responses. Mitochondria must maintain a delicate balance to prevent excessive ROS production, which can lead to oxidative stress and damage cellular components. In summary, mitochondria are vital cellular organelles in eukaryotes responsible for ATP production, calcium regulation, fatty acid metabolism, apoptosis regulation, heat production, and reactive oxygen species production. These critical functions make mitochondria indispensable to the proper functioning of eukaryotic cells."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive?

Why? No, it wasn’t a threat by terrorists, right-wing crazies or rabid fans, but a personal drone. According to NBC News, Obama had just finished playing golf and was heading back to his family’s vacation home when his U.S. Secret Service detail noticed the low-flying drone near the motorcade: The Secret Service quickly intervened and said the pilot of the small, quadcopter-style drone was “completely unaware” that Obama’s motorcade would be traveling through the area on Oahu. The man “immediately complied with law enforcement requests to cease and desist,” the statement added. No charges were filed and the motorcade did not stop or slow down because of the incident. It was just some guy with a personal drone, probably snooping on beach goers with its attached camera’s advanced zoom capabilities. Besides, would someone wearing a muscle t-shirt with the words “Laid Back, Easy Goin'” branded on it mean any ill will towards the president? Trigger-happy survivalists hell-bent on equipping every man, woman and child in America with a gun would probably say yes. But me?

I had no clue who she was, but I thought she was a year younger than me. That’s why I thought it was weird that she said my name. But the “nice sweatshirt” bit was what really got me. I wasn’t even wearing my sweatshirt. So. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don’t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name. “Hey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!” I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike? But my sweatshirt’s gray and purple! Then I remembered our little game of “try not to get caught swapping sweatshirts and giggling”. I wasn’t wearing my sweatshirt. Someone else had it.

Solve -10*k - 1219 = k - 1252 for k.","output":"Okay, little buddy, let's solve this equation step by step! We need to find the value of 'k' that makes the left side of the equation equal to the right side. Here's the equation: -10*k - 1219 = k - 1252 First, let's move the 'k' from the right side of the equation to the left side. To do that, we'll add 'k' to both sides. So, it looks like this: -10*k + k - 1219 = -1252 Now, let's combine the 'k's: (-10 + 1)*k - 1219 = -1252 -9*k - 1219 = -1252 Next, we want to move the -1219 to the right side of the equation. To do that, we'll add 1219 to both sides: -9*k = -1252 + 1219 Now, simplify the right side by adding the numbers: -9*k = -33 Lastly, to find 'k', we'll divide both sides by -9: k = -33 / -9 When we divide, we get: k = 33 / 9 k = 3.67 (approximately) So, the value of 'k' that makes the equation true is about 3.67.

It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

The box was found in 1881 in a hiding place of royal mummies collected and hidden away at the Deir al-Bahari temple about 1,000 metres away from the tomb. Checking all the mummies which might be Hatshepsut's, Yehya Zakariya, a medicine professor, found that the tooth was a perfect fit in a hole in the upper jaw of one of the two females, a fat woman believed to have suffered from cancer and diabetes. \\"The recognition of the tooth with the jaw can show this is Hatshepsut,\\" Hawass said. \\"A tooth is like a fingerprint.\\" Another researcher Elizabeth Thomas _ many years ago that one of the mummies was Hatshepsut's because how the right arm was put over the woman's chest suggested royalty .

Question: Why are proton pumps necessary for nutrient uptake? Context: Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.

The second question pertains to the naming conventions of sports tournaments. These questions touch on different aspects: one is about personal details while the other one is about sports terminology. To approach these questions, here's how I would conduct my research: 1. For the first question: I would look into any available interviews or public statements from Rafael Nadal or Maria Francisca Perello that explain why she does not often attend his matches. They might have shared this info in some of the interviews or on their social media platforms. 2. For the second question: I would delve into the history and reason behind why tournaments in these sports add 'Open' in the title.

Rationale: To answer this question, we should know that: To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. The question and answer:","output":"Question: What themes does Harper Lee explore in her 1960 novel, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\"? Answer: In \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" Harper Lee explores various themes that reflect the social and moral issues present in the 1930s American South. Some of the main themes in the novel include: 1. Racism and social inequality: Lee tackles the issue of racism through the trial of Tom Robinson, an African American man who is wrongly accused of raping a white woman. The novel also highlights the existence of social barriers and prejudices within different societal classes. 2. Morality and empathy: The importance of moral education is emphasized through the character of Atticus Finch, who teaches his children, Scout and Jem, to be empathetic and understanding towards others. This is exemplified in the quote, \\"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.\\" 3. Courage: Characters such as Atticus Finch and Boo Radley demonstrate both physical and moral courage against racism, injustice, and societal expectations. Atticus faces opposition for defending Tom Robinson, while Boo overcomes his reclusive nature to protect Scout and Jem from harm. 4. The loss of innocence: The book portrays the progression of Scout and Jem from childhood innocence to a more mature understanding of the unjust world around them. As they witness racism, violence, and injustice, their idyllic perceptions of their community are shattered. In summary, the themes present in Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" delve into various aspects of human nature, morality, and social constructs in a manner that confronts the harsh realities of 1930s America."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names.

They each eat 3 times a day. How many plates do Tom and his guests use while they are there for the 4 days if each person uses 2 plates per meal? Your thoughts:","output":"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. First, we need to determine the total number of people Tom has invited to his house. Tom has invited his parents and 3 siblings, so counting Tom himself, there are 1 (Tom) + 2 (parents) + 3 (siblings) = 6 people. 2. Next, we need to figure out how many meals are eaten during their 4-day stay. Since each person eats 3 meals per day, and there are 4 days, there are 3 meals/day * 4 days = 12 meals. 3. Now, let's calculate the number of plates used per meal. Each person uses 2 plates per meal, and there are 6 people, so 2 plates/person * 6 people = 12 plates per meal. 4. Finally, we need to determine the total number of plates used during the entire 4-day stay. Since there are 12 meals and 12 plates are used per meal, the total number of plates used is 12 meals * 12 plates/meal = 144 plates. So, Tom and his guests use 144 plates while they are at his house for the 4 days."},{"instruction":"Generate a question that has the following answer: mother not being around and feels alone and abandoned because she went away. for the following movie plot: A Better Life begins with Carlos Galindo (Demián Bichir) waking up and going to work.

By doing so, an individual can access information about the shows, including their scheduling and content. At the theater, the shows and events are typically listed in various formats, including posters, flyers, brochures, and digital displays. Additionally, the theater personnel, such as the box office staff and ushers, can provide valuable information about current and upcoming shows. These sources of information combine to create a comprehensive understanding of the theater's offerings. However, it is important to note that visiting the theater is not the only way to learn what's on. In today's world, there are alternative methods of obtaining this information. Many venues maintain an online presence through websites and social media platforms, where they share information about performances, including dates, times, synopses, and ticket availability. This enables individuals to explore the theater's program from the comfort of their homes or on-the-go. Moreover, theater enthusiasts can subscribe to email newsletters or follow specific theaters on social media to receive updates about the latest shows and events. This helps keep them informed without the need to physically visit the theater every time they want to know what's on. Finally, local newspapers, magazines, and online publications often provide coverage of the arts and theater events, offering another means to acquire information about the performances at a specific theater or within a region. In conclusion, while visiting the theater is indeed an effective way to learn what's on as the shows are listed there, it is not the only method. With advancements in technology and communication, individuals can explore a multitude of resources to gather information about current theater offerings, such as websites, social media, email newsletters, and local publications. These sources should all be considered when looking to uncover the breadth and variety of shows available at a theater or within a community."},{"instruction":"This is a really nice park that is half a mile away from a major freeway.

Over the years, Rebecca had immersed herself in the French way of life, frequenting local cafés, attending cultural events, and building friendships with many French people. As a result, her knowledge and familiarity with the country grew significantly. On the other hand, Erin had not been as fortunate in terms of travel opportunities and had not managed to visit France as often as she would have liked. Consequently, her understanding of the country was more limited, based mainly on what she had read in books or seen in the media rather than on personal experiences. Erin often found herself grappling with the language barrier and adapting to local customs and practices that were different from her own, which made her feel more like a foreigner in an unknown land. Despite these differences in familiarity, both Erin and Rebecca shared a genuine interest in learning about France and its rich and diverse heritage. Erin was eager to improve her French language skills and gain more insight into the country's history and traditions, while Rebecca continued to delve deeper into her passion for the French lifestyle and sought to discover even more hidden treasures in her favorite country. As their friendship grew stronger over time, Rebecca began to share her experiences and travel stories with Erin, and their mutual fondness for France turned into a bond that would knit them together for years to come. They would often dream of the day when they could both roam the streets of Paris, wine and dine in local bistros, and bask in the beauty of the Versailles Gardens, side by side. In anticipation of their future travels, Erin began taking French lessons to be better prepared for her next sojourn to the country, and Rebecca enthusiastically joined her, welcoming the opportunity to refresh her knowledge of the language as well. Through their dedication and shared passion for France, they were able to bridge the gap between their knowledge levels, becoming an unstoppable team of Francophiles. Together, Erin and Rebecca would embark on numerous adventures throughout France, from the medieval streets of Carcassonne to the sun-soaked coast of the Riviera, always with a newfound eagerness to explore, learn, and create lasting memories.

The pitcher should be large enough to hold at least 6 cups (1.5 liters) of liquid. This will include the lime juice, sugar, and ice. Your standard granulated sugar will work just fine, but superfine or castor sugar (not powdered) will work even better because it dissolves easier. Keep in mind that, because you are not cooking the sugar, you may end up with a few un-dissolved grains at the bottom of your pitcher. Be sure to stir the sugar well to help it dissolve. For a twist, try ⅔ cup (150 grams) of white sugar and 2 tablespoons (45 grams) of honey instead.

Add water slowly and taste to find the perfect balance. Don't put ice in the pitcher because it will water down the limeade. Put ice in glasses first, then pour limeade."},{"instruction":"How is \\"The most important thing for me is that working at the radio station helps me improve myself and develop.\\" said in Russian?","output":"In Russian, the sentence \\"The most important thing for me is that working at the radio station helps me improve myself and develop,\\" can be translated as \\"Самое главное для меня, что работа на радиостанции помогает мне совершенствоваться и развиваться.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1.

How to recycle a fire extinguisher Examine the canister for the product manufacturer's name. Look on the label of the fire extinguisher for the name of the manufacturer. This is typically located in large red or black letters.","output":"Step 1: Determine if the fire extinguisher is empty or still contains extinguishing agent. To ensure safety, you must first check if the fire extinguisher is already empty or still has a remaining extinguishing agent. You can do this by looking at the pressure gauge if available or by feeling the weight of the canister. Step 2: Discharge any remaining extinguishing agent. If the fire extinguisher still contains the extinguishing agent, it is crucial to discharge it in a safe and controlled environment. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to safely discharge the extinguisher or consult with the local fire department for assistance. Step 3: Make sure the fire extinguisher is fully depressurized. After discharging the extinguishing agent, ensure that the fire extinguisher is fully depressurized. You can do this by removing the safety pin and pressing the handle or trigger to release any remaining pressure. Step 4: Find an appropriate recycling facility. It is important to recycle fire extinguishers at a designated recycling facility that accepts hazardous materials. Look for facilities in your area that specialize in handling and recycling hazardous materials, such as household hazardous waste (HHW) facilities. Step 5: Contact the facility and inquire about their recycling procedures. Get in touch with the recycling facility to inquire about their specific recycling procedures and requirements for fire extinguishers. Some facilities might require an appointment or specific preparation procedures before drop-off. Step 6: Prepare the fire extinguisher for recycling. Before transporting the extinguisher to the recycling facility, make sure the safety mechanisms are disabled, and the canister is labeled as empty or depressurized. This will help ensure that the recycling facility can safely handle the material. Step 7: Transport the fire extinguisher to the recycling facility Once all necessary steps have been taken, carefully transport the fire extinguisher to the designated recycling facility while following their guidelines and safety requirements.

His father was a sharecropper named Agustin Arango, and his mother was Micaela Arambula. He grew up at the Rancho de la Coyotada, one of the largest haciendas in the state of Durango. Villa was a brilliant tactician on the battle field, which translated to political support. In 1913, local military commanders elected him provisional governor of the state of Chihuahua against the wishes of First Chief Carranza, who wished to name Manuel Chao instead. As Governor of Chihuahua, Villa recruited more experienced generals, including Toribio Ortega, Porfirio Talamantes, and Calixto Contreras to his military staff and achieved more success than ever. Villa's secretary, Perez Rul, divided his army into two groups, one led by Ortega, Contreras, and Orestes Pereira and the other led by Talamantes and Contreras' former deputy, Severianco Ceniceros. Villa's war tactics were studied by the United States Army and a contract with Hollywood was made whereby Hollywood would be allowed to film Villa's movements and 50% of Hollywood's profit would be paid to Villa to support the Revolution. As governor of Chihuahua, Villa raised more money for a drive to the south against Huerta's Federal Army by various methods. He printed his own currency and decreed that it could be traded and accepted at par with gold Mexican pesos. He forced the wealthy to give loans to fund the revolutionary war machinery. He confiscated gold from several banks, and in the case of the Banco Minero he held a member of the bank's owning family, the wealthy Terrazas clan, as a hostage until the location of the bank's hidden gold reserves was revealed. He also appropriated land owned by the hacendados (owners of the haciendas) and redistributed it to the widows and family of dead revolutionaries. Villa's political stature at that time was so high that banks in El Paso, Texas, accepted his paper pesos at face value. His generalship drew enough admiration from the U.S. military that he and Alvaro Obregon were invited to Fort Bliss to meet Brigadier General John J. Pershing. Returning to Mexico, Villa gathered supplies for a drive to the south. With so many sources of money, Villa expanded and modernized his forces, purchasing draft animals, cavalry horses, arms, ammunition, mobile hospital facilities (railroad cars and horse ambulances staffed with Mexican and foreign volunteer doctors, known as Servicio sanitario), and other supplies, and rebuilt the railroad south of Chihuahua City. He also recruited fighters from Chihuahua and Durango and created a large army known as the Division del Norte (Division of the North), the most powerful and feared military unit in all of Mexico. The rebuilt railroad transported Villa's troops and artillery south, where he defeated the Federal Army forces in a series of battles at Gomez Palacio, Torreon, and eventually at the heart of Huerta's regime in Zacatecas. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he accomplish anything important as governor?","output":"Yes, as governor, Pancho Villa accomplished important things. He raised money for the revolution, printed his own currency, forced the wealthy to give loans, and took land from hacienda owners to give to the widows and families of fallen revolutionaries. Villa's actions made him so popular that banks in El Paso, Texas, accepted his paper currency at face value. He also expanded and modernized his army, creating the Division del Norte, which became a powerful and feared military unit in Mexico."},{"instruction":"Review: to forgive that still serious problem Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The given sentence, \\"to forgive that still serious problem,\\" leans towards a negative sentiment, as it implies there is an issue present in the movie that remains unresolved. However, this negativity is slightly mitigated by the use of the word \\"forgive,\\" which implies that the reviewer acknowledges the movie's flaws but might suggest that other elements of the film compensate for this \\"serious problem.\\" To fully ascertain whether the movie review is negative or positive, it would be useful to have more context on the problem mentioned. Knowing its weight in relation to the overall movie experience can help in providing a more definite answer to the sentiment behind the review. In general, though, it is safe to say that the given sentence communicates a negative sentiment but with a possibility of forgiveness or leniency towards the movie's flaws. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the sentence: 1. The phrase \\"serious problem\\" alludes to a significant issue that persists in the movie. This creates a negative impression, signaling that the movie has flaws or shortcomings that impact the overall viewing experience. 2. The word \\"still\\" suggests that this problem has not been resolved, even after a certain period or despite changes made in the film. This compounds the negative sentiment, as it emphasizes that the issue has persisted. 3. The use of \\"forgive\\" implies that the reviewer might be willing to overlook the problem despite its seriousness. This has a slightly positive connotation, as it suggests that other elements in the movie might be strong enough to compensate for the serious problem mentioned. In conclusion, while the sentence primarily has a negative sentiment, there is room for forgiveness and potentially positive elements in the movie. More context would be needed to fully understand the review's overall sentiment."},{"instruction":"Q:What is the question to: \\"Life insurance is a contract between an insured (insurance policy holder) and an insurer , where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money (the \\"benefits\\") upon the death of the insured person.\\"?

I certainly agree with the point you make at the end of your book that in the absence of agreement for controlled testing of claimed paranormal powers, we must make rough and ready judgements analogous (similar in certain respects) with judgements made in court house contexts. Please remove spaces between words.","output":"The analogy you make in the closing of your book is a compelling one. It's a comparison that, while initially might seem unorthodox, provides a fresh perspective on how we should approach evaluating and assessing claims of paranormal phenomena. The absence of consensus towards controlled testing certainly presents a formidable obstacle in making sound and grounded evaluations. In this aspect, we find ourselves sailing in largely uncharted waters of understanding and comprehension. Borrowing from your analogy, we might imagine the inquiry into paranormal claims as something akin to the proceedings of a court case. Just as with disputed claims in a court case, these paranormal claims require meticulous examination and rigorous scrutiny to distinguish hoax from reality. If there is insufficient concrete evidence to prove or disprove these claims, we are left to rely on rough estimations and educated guesses, akin to verdicts made amidst ambiguous or uncertain evidence in court. If we delve deeper into this analogy, it can shed light on some pivotal aspects of the investigation. Take for instance, the claimant in paranormal context, who is the equivalent of the prosecutor in a court case. It's their responsibility to present sufficient and compelling evidence to support their claim. On the other hand, the skeptics and scientific community play a role resembling the jury and the judge, tasked with analyzing the evidence impartially and objectively. An essential principle in courtroom jurisprudence is the presumption of innocence or \\"innocent until proven guilty.\\" Applying this principle to the paranormal context would mean maintaining a skepticism towards unproven claims; these claims remain unaccepted until definitive proof materializes. The absence of consensus on controlled testing is problematic, akin to the absence of established law or legal precedence in a courtroom. In this scenario, we must rely on other means to evaluate and validate the credibility and authenticity of these claims. The decisions we make will largely be based on the evidence presented, our understanding of the paranormal, and the authenticity of testimonies. As such, it becomes vital to ensure a certain degree of rigor in these rough and ready judgements. Inductive and deductive reasoning, correlation, and causation will govern the logic of our deductions. Just like in a court case, this will demand a meticulous and exhaustive examination of all presented evidence. Credibility of witnesses, consistency of testimonies, and the consideration of outside factors and variables all play a role in forming our judgement. The judgement, however, doesn't end the process. In legal context, a verdict could lead to appeals, retrials, or even changes in laws. Literally speaking - it's not the end, but rather a stepping stone in the path towards justice. Similarly, in our paranormal context, a judgement (whether acceptance or denial of a claim) should be seen as an opportunity for further inquiry, research, and understanding, rather than a final verdict. In conclusion, the absence of an agreement for controlled testing of paranormal powers indeed pushes us towards making these seemingly rough and ready judgements. However, paralleling these decisions to those made in court house contexts provides us with a useful framework to consider when facing this challenge. Just as justice strives to be served in each case in a court of law likewise, we must strive to peel back the layers of uncertainty that shroud paranormal claims, inching ever closer towards the light of truth."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you are given an input list A.

He discovered that doubling the pressure of an enclosed sample of gas while keeping its temperature constant caused the volume of the gas to be reduced by half. Boyle’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. An inverse relationship is described in this way. As one variable increases in value, the other variable decreases. Paragraph: Brian has two identical containers of the same gas sitting on his kitchen table. He has a device that allows him to increase the pressure of any container he wants. He brings the device up to container B but decides not to use it.

The two sisters had always been very different, with Erin being the carefree and spontaneous one while Emily tended to worry about every little thing. It wasn't just their personalities that diverged; even their appearances were like night and day. Erin was a natural blonde with long, wavy hair and blue eyes, whereas Emily had always been a brunette with straight, chestnut locks and brown eyes. The hair dying incident wasn't the first time they'd had conversations about aging and appearance. As they entered their late thirties and began to approach their fortieth birthdays, time seemed to be putting its marks on them even further. Erin's face remained relatively unmarked, but Emily's worry lines were becoming more pronounced. Erin, always out to enjoy herself, delved into every new experience with gusto. She saw aging as an opportunity to grow, to become wiser, and to enjoy life's different phases. When she started seeing fine lines around her eyes, she took it as a sign of the constant laughter and joy that had filled her life. She was never shy to share her opinion with Emily, who was much harder on herself when it came to beauty and aging. Their conversation on that sunny afternoon took place in Emily's brand-new house, which she had designed with her husband, Mark. It was a beautiful colonial-style home with white columns and large windows overlooking the lush green backyard. Emily had always been a fan of interior design, and her home was a testament to her impeccable taste and attention to detail. Erin, on the other hand, had settled into a cozy beach bungalow that suited her free-spirited nature. Sitting in the beautifully decorated living room, Emily couldn't help but complain to Erin about the trials of aging. She bemoaned the gray hairs and wrinkles, wishing she could turn back time. Erin, ever the optimist, urged Emily to embrace the changes with grace. She pointed out the positive aspects of growing older, like their expanding families, successful careers, and the wealth of experiences and wisdom they had accumulated over the years. Despite her sister's enthusiasm, Emily remained unconvinced. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was losing something of value by growing older, and she wondered why Erin seemed immune to these insecurities. One evening, after another fruitless conversation with Erin about the importance of acceptance, Emily confided in her husband about her worries. To her surprise, Mark gently reminded her of how beautiful she was and expressed his love and attraction towards her, no matter their age. He shared his admiration for the way her face lit up when she laughed or when she lost herself in deep thought. He confessed that he had fallen in love with her for her soul, her intelligence, her wit, and her warmth, not just her youthful appearance. Inspired by her husband's perspective, Emily finally began to understand Erin's point of view. She started pondering the idea that beauty could go beyond just her physical appearance and that there was something timeless, more meaningful in her experiences, the love of her family, and the comfort of her marriage. As the days and weeks passed, Emily began to embrace this new outlook gradually. When she looked in the mirror, she no longer saw just the gray hairs and wrinkles but a woman who had grown and evolved over time, becoming even stronger and more remarkable in the process. Thanks to Erin and Mark, Emily had learned that true beauty lay in her relationships, experiences, and resilience, something that no wrinkle or gray hair could ever take away."},{"instruction":"Question.

PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive. - FreeDOS (formerly Free-DOS and PD-DOS) is a free operating system for IBM PC compatible computers. It intends to provide a complete DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems. - PTS-DOS is a disk operating system, a DOS clone, developed in Russia by PhysTechSoft. - A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc. A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems. - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system. - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use. - Betrayal at Krondor is a DOS-based role-playing video game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line in the summer of 1993. \\"Betrayal at Krondor\\" takes place largely in Midkemia, the fantasy world developed by Raymond E.

The game is designed to resemble a book, separated into chapters and narrated in the third-person with a quick-save bookmark feature. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation. - A-10 Tank Killer is a flight simulation computer game for Amiga and DOS platforms developed and published by Dynamix.

In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name.

Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement.

An adult entertainment company - with a knack for gimmicky publicity stunts - has offered 'Foxy Knoxy' 20,000 to star in a porn film. Adult film distributor Monarchy Distribution says it's offering Knox the 'unique opportunity' to pay her mounting legal bills and fund her education by getting naked on film. 'Smokin' hot': Amanda Knox has been offered 20,000 to appear in a porn film. Foxy Knoxy: Knox's good looks has been a constant theme as her case worked its way through the Italian legal system. Guilty: Knox was again found guilty of murder in the case of Meredith Kercher - after an appeals court ruled that she was innocent. 'As you may have read, and were most likely well aware of, the general consensus is you are absolutely smoking hot,' company founder Michael Kulich writes in an e-mail to Knox forwarded to the Daily Dot. 'Since you came back into the headlines, our loyal fan base has been e-mailing us non-stop asking about you.' Kulich's email gives Knox the assurance that she would have final say 'over all terms of production' - Kulich says Knox will get to choose which sex acts she performs on film, and which 'talent' she wants to work with. 'This is a great opportunity for you to make some money to put towards. finishing your education and also future legal costs to help with this. unfortunate retrial,' Kulich continues. This is far from the first time Kulich's company has tried to cash in on attractive women who make headlines. In December of 2013, Kulich made a similar offer to shamed former PR executive Justine Sacco. PR Stunt: Monarchy Distribution offered shamed former PR executive Justine Sacco 10,000 to appear in a porn film. Sacco - a former public relations executive with IAC, an Internet company with brands like Ask.com and The Daily Beast - made headlines last year when she posted derogatory, racial remarks on Twitter before boarding a flight to Africa. 'Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!' Sacco tweeted on December 22. Before Sacco's flight touched down in South Africa, news of her offensive tweet had already made headlines across the globe - there were journalists and photographers waiting at the airport for her flight to land. She was promptly fired by IAC CEO Barry Diller. After the incident, Kulich offered Sacco 10,000 to appear in an adult film with the title 'Justine's African Vacation.' For another PR stunt, Kulich used political laughing stock Anthony Weiner's notoriety to push his brand. Weiner: Monarchy Distribution also used the further shaming of former Congressman Anthony Weiner to push his brand. Porn star: Anthony Weiner gal Sydney Leathers appeared in a porn film spoofing her relationship with Weiner. In July of 2013, after it was revealed that Weiner's X-rated social media habits continued well after he was forced to resign from Congress for a series of sexually charged conversations he had with women over social networking sites, Weiner was pressured by many to end his bid to become the Democratic nominee for New York City's mayor. After the scandal broke, Kulich announced that he was producing a movie titled 'Don't Pull Out,' and donating 15 percent of the profits to Weiner's failed mayoral campaign. After news of Weiner's texting made headlines, the woman at the center of the scandal - Sydney Leathers - appeared in a porn film spoofing the Weiner scandal. Leathers' film is titled 'Weiner and Me.' This isn't the first time Knox has been offered a job in the porn industry; in 2011, after winning the appeal of her initial guilty verdict in the Kercher murder case, Vivid Entertainment - which, like Monarch Distribution - has a long history of headline-inspired publicity stunts - offered Knox a job. 'We would like to offer her the opportunity to be our vivid.com spokesperson and represent the studio at trade and retail events.This would involve no nudity or sex. Of course we would welcome talking to her if she wants to pursue this direction, but the decision is totally hers to express,\\" the company said in its publicized offer to Knox.

Enacted in 1972, Title IX is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education and athletic activities. Over the past four decades, the law has successfully produced improvements in educational and athletic opportunities for women and girls in the United States. Female academic enrollment has surged, and girls' athletic participation has increased nearly tenfold. These impressive strides have led to greater social and economic mobility for women, as well as enhanced physical and mental well-being. However, despite the perseverance of Title IX advocates and the improvements made due to the law, minorities—especially African American, Latina, Asian, and Native American women—remain disproportionately underrepresented in education and collegiate athletics. As a result, they experience limited access to the same opportunities as their white counterparts. To begin addressing this disparity, it is essential to recognize the factors contributing to this inequity. For many minority women and girls, limited financial resources are a significant barrier to entry in higher education and sports. Studies have shown that minority households often have lower incomes, which affects their ability to afford tuition and access to resources such as athletic equipment, facilities, and coaching. In addition to financial barriers, minority women and girls face cultural and societal obstacles that deter them from pursuing educational and athletic opportunities. For instance, some may encounter resistance from family members due to cultural beliefs that prioritize traditional gender roles, which often place limited value on women's educational and athletic endeavors. Furthermore, the lack of representation of minority women in higher education and athletics can lead to a discouraging perception that these arenas are not welcoming or supportive environments for them. To address these challenges and create a more inclusive environment under Title IX, the following steps must be taken: 1. Increase financial assistance: Federal, state, and local governments should allocate additional funding to address the financial barriers that prevent minority women from accessing higher education and sports opportunities. This includes expanding scholarship programs, providing more grants, and reducing tuition fees for minority students, as well as ensuring that schools in low-income neighborhoods have access to adequate sports facilities and equipment. 2. Raise awareness and challenge cultural barriers: Schools, community organizations, and parents should collaborate to raise awareness about the importance of education and sports for women of all backgrounds and challenge cultural myths that undermine their participation. This may involve holding workshops, seminars, and mentorship programs for minority parents and girls to educate them about available opportunities and encourage involvement. 3. Increase diversity and representation in coaching and administration: Schools and athletic programs should prioritize the hiring of diverse coaching and administrative staff to ensure that women of all backgrounds feel supported and empowered. Representation matters, and role models from relatable backgrounds can provide guidance and encouragement to minority girls as they pursue their educational and athletic passions. 4. Foster ongoing collaboration and dialogue: Educators, administrators, coaches, and parents should engage in an ongoing dialogue about the unique challenges minority women face when working to achieve equity under Title IX. Open conversations will foster understanding and collaboration, leading to more effective programs and initiatives that support minority women in their academic and athletic pursuits. As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of Title IX and its transformative impact on women and girls, it is crucial that we continue to work together to ensure that every individual, regardless of their race or ethnicity, has an equal opportunity to excel in education and sports. By addressing the disparities that persist for minority women, we can honor the spirit of Title IX and pave the way for a more inclusive and equitable future for all."},{"instruction":"Are these paraphrases?

James Travis Tritt was born on February 9, 1963 in Marietta, Georgia, to James and Gwen Tritt.

At age fourteen, his parents bought him another guitar, and he learned more songs from his uncle, Sam Lockhart. In 1991, Tritt received a second Horizon Award nomination, which he won that year. He also released his second album, It's All About to Change. The album went on to become his best-selling, with a triple-platinum certification from the RIAA for shipments of three million copies. All four of its singles reached the top five on the country music charts. \\"Here's a Quarter (Call Someone Who Cares)\\" and the Marty Stuart duet \\"The Whiskey Ain't Workin',\\" respectively the first and third singles, both reached number two, with the number-one \\"Anymore\\" in between. \\"Nothing Short of Dying\\" was the fourth single, with a peak at number four on Billboard; both it and \\"The Whiskey Ain't Working\\" went to Number One on Radio & Records. \\"Bible Belt,\\" another cut from the album (recorded in collaboration with Little Feat), appeared in the 1992 film My Cousin Vinny (the lyrics for the song, however, were changed for the version played in the movie to match the story line). Although not released as a single, it peaked at number 72 country based on unsolicited airplay and was the b-side to \\"Nothing Short of Dying.\\" \\"Bible Belt\\" was inspired by a youth pastor whom Tritt knew in his childhood. Stuart offered \\"The Whiskey Ain't Workin' Anymore\\" to Tritt backstage at the CMA awards show, and they recorded it as a duet through the suggestion of Tritt's record producer, Gregg Brown. The duet won both artists the next year's Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. Tritt and Stuart charted a second duet, \\"This One's Gonna Hurt You (For a Long, Long Time),\\" which went to number seven in mid-1992 and appeared on Stuart's album This One's Gonna Hurt You. This song won the 1992 CMA award for Vocal Event of the Year. In June 1992, Tritt received media attention when he criticized Billy Ray Cyrus' \\"Achy Breaky Heart\\" at a Fan Fair interview, saying that he did not think that Cyrus' song made a \\"statement\\".

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said.

Rationale: A boat is a watercraft designed primarily for navigating on bodies of water. Its primary use case is to float on water and move from one point to another via propulsion (sailing, rowing, or with an engine). A street, on the other hand, is a paved or otherwise improved public thoroughfare meant for vehicular and pedestrian traffic. It consists of a road or a path with solid ground. Boats and streets serve different purposes and are built for distinct environments. Generally, boats are not designed to operate on land or solid ground. Attempting to use a boat to cross a street would encounter numerous difficulties and inefficiencies. 1. Boats are not designed for land travel: Boats are designed to displace water and float, while vehicles designed for road use have wheels for smooth travel on solid surfaces. 2. Damage to the boat: Dragging a boat across a street could cause damage to the boat's hull or structure, impacting its functionality, and requiring costly repairs. 3. Inefficient and impractical: Without wheels or a proper method for movement on solid ground, trying to move a boat across a street would prove to be highly inefficient and time-consuming.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

But for a certain breed of champion, the desire to conquer new challenges and stake their claim as the best never seems to diminish. This elite group of individuals fully embraces the notion that success is fleeting, and that maintaining their hard-earned position of greatness requires a constant commitment to growth and improvement. One shining example of this mentality is our subject and the focus of this article: a fierce competitor who's not only in it to win it, but is back for the second time, ready to push the envelope with her unwavering, relentless spirit. A thirst for victory There is something almost intoxicating about the taste of victory. When you pour your blood, sweat, and tears into a goal, finally achieving it can bring a sense of euphoria, validation, and satisfaction unlike anything else. For those who experience this victorious high, it can become a driving force, propelling them to continue to chase after that feeling as they take on new challenges and set their sights on even loftier achievements. Our protagonist exemplifies this relentless thirst for victory and continued success, having tasted the sweet nectar of triumph once and now striving for more. Taking the road less traveled The path to greatness is rarely an easy or straightforward one, and our champion's journey is no exception. Rather than coasting along the well-trodden path of mediocrity and settling for just enough, she chose to follow her passion and plant her flag on the summit of excellence. This route is often marked by heartache, setbacks, and failure, but rather than being deterred by these difficulties, she discovered that determination, grit, and resilience are her most powerful weapons.

The ability to defy the odds and overcome adversity doesn't just happen overnight. It takes a steely determination, unwavering self-belief, and a willingness to push past the limits of what's possible in pursuit of greatness.

A lasting legacy For those who witness the incredible journey of this phenomenal competitor, the impact of her relentless drive to succeed is palpable.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question How may I be feeling right now ?","output":"Based on the preceding passage, you may be feeling a mix of emotions right now. Let's break it down and analyze the text to understand your feelings better. 1. Relief: You mention that the keys were found, indicating that you had initially misplaced them or were worried that they were lost. Once the keys were discovered, it is likely that you felt a sense of relief due to the resolution of this problem. 2. Emotional vulnerability: You mention that you sat down and wept. This suggests that you were overwhelmed with emotions, which could be a result of the stress you were experiencing in trying to locate the keys, or perhaps due to the deeper theme of letting go of control. Weeping can be a cathartic release, a way for you to express and process your feelings. 3. Reflective: Throughout the passage, you are looking back on your experiences over the past two years – specifically, the theme of letting go of control. Reflecting on past experiences and personal growth can lead to feelings of nostalgia and contemplation, as you think about how far you have come and the lessons you have learned. 4. Humble: Jayber's joke about God reckoning you needed one final lesson in letting go of control seems to highlight your awareness of your own flaws and imperfections. This self-awareness likely brings forth feelings of humility, acknowledging that you still have room for growth and improvement, especially in the area of relinquishing control. 5. Hopeful or optimistic: Your statement about not throwing things this time and the possibility of a tiny hint of progress suggests that you may feel hopeful or optimistic about your personal growth. You recognize that the lesson is not yet complete, but you seem to be encouraged by the small progress you've made. In summary, you may be feeling relief, emotional vulnerability, reflection, humility, and hope or optimism at this moment. Emotions can often intermingle, and it is understandable that you would experience a complex mix of feelings after such an introspective and challenging experience."},{"instruction":"Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the part of Belton again saw war service during World War II? ? In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish...

Through these experiences, he gained valuable knowledge and skills that would later contribute to his business endeavors. His unique vision and innovative ideas led him to establish the first-ever mail-order business, Montgomery Ward & Company, in 1872. During his time, retail stores were primarily available in urban areas, making it difficult for rural customers to access goods. Aaron Montgomery Ward recognized this gap in the market and aimed to provide a convenient solution. By creating a mail-order catalog, he brought goods directly to the homes of rural Americans, revolutionizing the retail landscape. Montgomery Ward's success laid the foundation for future mail-order businesses and transformed the way goods were consumed and distributed across America. Not only did his company break barriers for rural customers, but it also provided an opportunity for new businesses to thrive within the growing industry.

In contrast to the timid Mary, Paulie is full of life. For example, at Mary's very first day at the school during a quiet afternoon party on the campus thrown by the staff as a welcome back gathering, Paulie turns the events into a loud music-blasting dance party and spikes the punch with hard liquor. In an effort to break Mary out of her shell, Paulie and Tori involve her in their activities, such as running in the morning. When Mary's roommates learn that her mother recently died, Paulie nicknames her \\"Mary Brave\\". Mary observes the intimacy between her two roommates. Peering out a window at night, she sees them kissing on a roof. At first, she thinks that they are practicing kissing in order to prepare themselves for kissing men, but she soon realises the nature of their romance.

For example, Paulie defends Victoria from a frustrated math teacher who unintentionally humiliates her when she does not understand a mathematical equation.

As Paulie's love for Tori remains intense and undimmed, her emotional state suffers greatly from Tori's rejection.

The falcon can be seen as a metaphor for both Paulie's character and the relationship between Paulie and Tori - fierce, wild, and beautiful, but also fragile and unable to fully heal from its wounds. Mary becomes increasingly worried about Paulie as her mental health deteriorates, and she tries to offer support and help her friend regain a sense of stability.

They share many morphological features with the scorpionfish of the family Scorpaenidae. - Cirrhitichthys is a genus of hawkfishes found on tropical reefs in the Indian and western Pacific oceans . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753.

Step 2: Identify the parent taxon - In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. Step 3: Explain the chosen answer - The family Cirrhitidae, which includes hawkfishes, is the parent taxon for the genus Cirrhitichthys.

Movie title: Charlotte's Web Movie plot: With the birth of a new litter of 11 piglets, the farmer must eliminate one so the mother can feed them. The farmer gets his ax and selects the runt of the litter when he is stopped by his daughter, Fern (Dakota Fanning). Fern begins to feed her new piglet and names him Wilbur (voice of Dominic Scott Kay). After Wilbur gets strong enough to be on his own, he is put into the barn across the road. In the new barn, he meets many different animals: cows, sheep, geese, a rat, a horse, and of course a spider named Charlotte (voice of Julia Roberts). Wilbur's friendship with all the animals in the barn brings them all together, and they become one big happy family. There is only one problem that Wilbur doesn't know, he is a spring pig, and they don't usually get to see winter. Charlotte promises Wilbur that she will do something to save his life. Charlotte spins the words \\"some pig\\" in her web to show the farmer a miracle that may save Wilbur's life.

In the programme, which will be screened on BT Sport on Boxing Day, it is revealed: John Fashanu (centre) and Vinnie Jones (right) were central figures in Wimbledon's Crazy Gang Dave Beasant holds the FA Cup on manager Bobby Gould's head after their fairytale victory in 1988 It was refined slightly when he was replaced by OPTIONS: - BT Sport in 1987 but only slightly. - Bobby Gould in 1987 but only slightly. - Boxing Day in 1987 but only slightly. - Club in 1987 but only slightly. - Crazy Gang in 1987 but only slightly. - Dave Beasant in 1987 but only slightly. - FA Cup in 1987 but only slightly. - Fashanu in 1987 but only slightly. - John Fashanu in 1987 but only slightly. - John Scales in 1987 but only slightly. - Lawrie Sanchez in 1987 but only slightly. - Liverpool in 1987 but only slightly. - Manchester City in 1987 but only slightly. - Terry Phelan in 1987 but only slightly. - Vinnie Jones in 1987 but only slightly. - Wally Downes in 1987 but only slightly. - Wembley in 1987 but only slightly. - Wimbledon in 1987 but only slightly. - Wimbledon FC in 1987 but only slightly.","output":"Bobby Gould in 1987 but only slightly. The situation escalated during a training session when one of the team members, Terry Phelan, pushed Fashanu's buttons too far. Fashanu reacted violently, grabbing Phelan and throwing him around the dressing room, slamming him onto the floor multiple times. The other players, including Vinnie Jones, stood by in shock, some attempting unsuccessfully to intervene and break up the fight. After the brutal incident, the team's dynamics were severely affected, and management realized that they needed to take action to address the core issues within the group. The hiring of Bobby Gould in 1987 as the new manager was a crucial turning point for the team, as Gould was determined to maintain a level of discipline and focus while acknowledging the unique personalities and history of the Crazy Gang. Under Gould's management, the team started working together more effectively and took their competitive spirit to the field rather than direct it at each other. While the intensity and craziness of the Crazy Gang were not entirely gone, its members slowly began to trust each other and function as a cohesive unit. Their dedication to improving together paid off when they won the FA Cup in 1988, defeating the heavily favored Liverpool. Despite the dark chapter in their history, the Crazy Gang and that particular FA Cup victory are remembered as a classic underdog story, and the team's journey has since been immortalized through documentaries and interviews. While the incident between Fashanu and Phelan serves as a cautionary tale of unchecked aggression and ego in sports, it also highlights the importance of strong leadership, unwavering team spirit, and the power of change. The story ends on a positive note, with the Wimbledon players and the Crazy Gang healing from their past traumas and learning to grow both individually and as a team. The club moves forward into the future with the hard lessons they've learned etched in their history, and they continue to be an inspiration for teams who dare to dream of achieving great things against all odds."},{"instruction":"Program Modification Sometimes not only virus TrojanWin32AgentK or malware DVD copy Pro but also common softwares possessing the ability to modify the inner functions of Dot4Scansys which means other programs cant find this DLL file again Could you correct the punctuation please?","output":"Program Modification: Sometimes, not only viruses like TrojanWin32AgentK or malware such as DVD Copy Pro, but also common software possesses the ability to modify the inner functions of Dot4Scansys.

Flat-screen displays represent a significant departure from the traditional cathode-ray tube (CRT) technology that dominated the television and computer monitor industry for decades. There are two main types of flat-screen displays: liquid crystal display (LCD) and plasma display panel (PDP). LCD technology was invented by Austrian chemist Otto Lehmann in the late 19th century and was initially used for research purposes. However, it wasn't until 1968 that George H. Heilmeier, an engineer at RCA Laboratories, developed the first LCD display using various liquid crystal structures to control light transmission properties. Working with his colleagues Louis Zanoni and Lucian Barton, Heilmeier unveiled an early prototype in 1970. RCA produced the first commercially available LCD–based display products in the 1970s, which were mostly calculators and digital watches. Meanwhile, plasma display technology was conceived by two researchers at the University of Illinois, Donald Bitzer and H. Gene Slottow, in 1964. The idea behind PDPs is the excitation of plasma gas to create visible light. In 1967, Bitzer and Slottow demonstrated the first monochrome plasma display. However, it would take another two decades for companies to refine and produce full-color PDPs for commercial use. In the early 1990s, flat-screen technology began making its way into the consumer market as laptop computers incorporated LCD screens. Meanwhile, plasma displays started appearing in public spaces, such as airports and sports venues. In 1997, Philips and Sony released the first flat-screen televisions using plasma technology. A year later, Sharp Corporation and Sony released the first large LCD TVs, ranging from 28 to 37 inches. As flat-screen technology continued to develop, both LCD and plasma TVs grew in popularity. In the early 2000s, LCDs began to overtake CRTs as the preferred display technology for computer monitors, and by the mid-2000s, flat-screen TVs became more affordable and commonplace in households worldwide. Their slim and lightweight designs, improved image quality, energy efficiency, and adaptability made them highly attractive to consumers. By the late 2000s, LCD overtook plasma as the leading flat-screen technology due to lower manufacturing costs, better energy efficiency, and a more extensive range of sizes. In recent years, LCD technology has evolved to include LED-backlit displays and OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) panels, offering even better image quality, color accuracy, and energy efficiency. Flat-screen displays have revolutionized the way we consume visual media, and their evolution is a testament to the continuous improvements in modern technology throughout the past few decades."},{"instruction":"Review: When I first started watching this movie I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train.

The development of a game like '10th Frame' entails numerous stages ranging from initial concept development, programming, character design, data input, testing, to the final release. The complexity of the process reflects the technical and creative considerations in game development, highlighting the role of a developer like Access Software. So, based on the information provided and understanding of the video game development process, '10th Frame' holds the 'developer' relationship with 'Access Software'. It's essential to note that Bruce Carver, although a co-founder of Access Software and key figure in its initial development projects, is an individual entity separate from the development company itself. Similarly, Indie Built is Access Software's subsequent name after rebranding, and 'produce' is associated with the process, not the entity. Hence, these choices don't represent the 'developer' relationship with '10th Frame'."},{"instruction":"Q: Is this product review positive?

Although invisible to the naked eye, these deposits could lead to unpleasant odors, inefficient flushing, and overall low performance. Regular toilet tank cleaning is thus essential to ensure a properly functioning and hygienic bathroom environment. This article provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how to effectively clean your toilet tank and maintain its optimal performance. Step 1: Gather necessary materials Before starting the cleaning process, ensure that you have the following items: - Rubber gloves - A commercial cleaner or natural cleaning alternative, such as vinegar - A sponge or scrub brush - A bucket or container to collect dirty water - A cloth or paper towel for drying Step 2: Put on gloves Begin by putting on a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands from the cleaning chemicals and germs in the toilet tank. Make sure the gloves fit well to avoid possible slips during the cleaning process. Step 3: Turn off water supply and flush the toilet Shut off the water supply to the toilet by turning the valve located near the base of the toilet, typically on the left-hand side. Then, flush the toilet to empty the tank and create a conducive environment for cleaning. This will also help you assess the tank for any issues easily. Step 4: Let your cleaner sit in the tank Choose your desired cleaner, either a commercial cleaner designed for toilet tanks or a natural alternative, such as vinegar. If using a commercial cleaner, be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions. Generally, you will need to pour a generous amount of cleaner, approximately 1-2 cups, into the tank. If opting for the natural alternative, pour undiluted white vinegar into the tank until it covers the bottom and reaches about an inch in height. Vinegar is an excellent choice for cleaning, as its acidic properties effectively remove mineral buildup and kill bacteria, mildew, and mold. Allow the cleaner to sit in the tank for at least 10-15 minutes, giving it ample time to break down mineral deposits and sanitize the tank effectively. Step 5: Scrub your cleaner into the tank After allowing the cleaner to sit in the tank, gently scrub the inside of the tank using a sponge or scrub brush. Pay particular attention to areas with visible mineral buildup, staining, and rust, as these require thorough cleansing to prevent recurrent issues. Make sure to scrub the sides, rim, and the bottom of the tank for a comprehensive cleaning. Step 6: Flush out the tank Once you have scrubbed all areas of the tank, use a bucket or container to collect the dirty water and dispose of it appropriately. Turn the water supply back on to refill the tank and then flush it a few times to rinse out any remaining cleaner and loosened deposits. Step 7: Dry the tank Use a clean cloth or paper towel to wipe off any excess water left in the tank after flushing. Ensuring that the tank is not excessively damp will prevent the growth of mold and mildew. Step 8: Check for any leakage or damage Inspect your tank thoroughly, looking for signs of leakage, damage, or wear. Should you discover any issues, address them immediately to prevent further complications. Conclusion Regularly cleaning your toilet tank not only ensures a hygienic environment but also extends the lifespan of your toilet system. This guide aims to help you achieve optimal results effectively and efficiently. By dedicating a few minutes to clean your toilet tank every 3-6 months, you can significantly improve the overall hygiene and functionality of your bathroom."},{"instruction":"How is \\"A verdict by Turkey's State Security Court (DGM) upholding the 15-year prison terms of four Kurdish rights activists has drawn sharp condemnation from the EU, which warned Turkey that its bid to join the Union could be at risk.\\" said in Romanian?","output":"In order to translate the given text into Romanian, I will follow these steps: 1.

Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\". A:","output":"The full name of the person who was a considerable influence on Handel in the three years that he spent in Hamburg is Reinhard Keiser."},{"instruction":"As of the census of 2000, there were 325,957 people, 149,937 households, and 94,460 families residing in the county.

Given the two facts above, being exposed to what can cause erosion of dirt? The answer is:","output":"Being exposed to wind can cause erosion of dirt. It is important to analyze both facts to understand the correlation between soil erosion and its perceived value. Fact 1 highlights that being exposed to wind can cause erosion of soil. Erosion is a natural process in which the earth's surface is gradually worn away by the action of wind, water, or ice. Wind erosion occurs when the wind's force detaches and transports soil particles from one place to another. This process can have significant consequences on the landscape, leading to the loss of valuable topsoil and reduction in soil fertility. Over time, wind erosion can transform lush landscapes into barren land, reducing their capacity to support plant growth and ecosystems. Fact 2 indicates that many people view soil as merely dirt, leading to a lack of appreciation for its true value. Soil is a complex mixture of organic matter, minerals, and microorganisms that support life on Earth. It plays a vital role in agriculture, providing nutrients and a medium for plants to grow. Additionally, soil acts as a natural water filter, regulating the flow of water and helping to prevent floods. By misunderstanding and undervaluing the significance of soil, people are less likely to take actions to protect and conserve it, contributing to issues like erosion and soil degradation. Given these facts, being exposed to wind can cause erosion of dirt, but such a statement oversimplifies the issue. Recognizing that soil is more than just dirt is crucial in understanding the consequences of erosion and the importance of soil preservation. Efforts should be made to raise awareness about soil's true value and implement sustainable practices, such as planting windbreaks or implementing cover crops, to mitigate wind erosion and promote healthy, fertile land for future generations."},{"instruction":"Translate from English to Spanish: So that our Christmas turkey does not dry out, there is a “watering” at certain times during cooking.

Let's analyze the given options: (A) In a log cabin: A log cabin is a man-made structure and might not have the requisite damp, shaded environment or sufficient organic material for the growth of slime molds. However, if there is moisture or humid conditions inside, it might be a suitable place but it's not the most likely one. (B) Swamp vegetation: Swamps are characterized by damp, highly humid conditions and are rich in decaying organic matter. These conditions make swamps an ideal habitat for slime molds. (C) Mouth of rivers: The mouth of rivers is where the river meets the ocean, and the characteristics of these areas do not fit the conditions required for slime mold growth. (D) An area swollen with pus: Pus consists of dead tissue, bacteria, and white blood cells, but the conditions present in a swollen pus-filled region are not suitable for the growth of slime molds. (E) In decomposing matter: Slime molds thrive in environments rich with decomposing organic matter, as they feed on bacteria, fungi, and dead plant material. This option is one of the most likely places to find slime molds. (F) Germy surfaces: While germy surfaces consist of bacteria and other microbes, they may not provide the appropriate damp, shaded environment or sufficient organic material that slime molds require. (G) On a new car: A new car is an unlikely place to find slime mold, as new cars are usually dry and free of the decomposing materials required for these organisms to grow. (H) On a mushroom dish: Though mushrooms are fungi and grow in similar conditions to slime molds, a prepared mushroom dish would not provide the appropriate damp, shaded environment or sufficient organic material needed for slime mold growth. Considering the suitable conditions for slime mold growth, the most likely places to find them would be option (B) swamp vegetation and option (E) in decomposing matter.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"In order to analyze this situation, we must first understand the meanings of the two statements provided: the premise and the hypothesis. The premise, \\"it was that bad huh\\" implies that a situation or an event experienced or discussed might have been unfavorable or undesirable. There is an assumption that it was, in fact, bad. This statement reflects a certain level of subjectivity, as the term 'bad' can depend on individual perceptions and experiences. The hypothesis, \\"It could have been worse right?\\" is a proposition that, while acknowledging the negative aspects of the situation or event, proposes that it could have been even more detrimental or undesirable. This statement introduces an element of speculation; depending on the specific circumstances, the situation could potentially have been worse or not. Now, with the understanding of both statements, we can investigate whether the truth of the hypothesis solely relies on the truth of the premise. Let's analyze this using the concept of logical entailment. Logical entailment is a relationship between statements, where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, it is essential to assess if the truth of the premise directly leads to the truth of the hypothesis. Considering the premise, there is an assumption that a particular situation or event was 'bad' (undesirable). This statement does not provide information about the severity or extent to which it was undesirable. On the other hand, the hypothesis conveys an element of comparison: the idea that the situation could have been worse, or that there were possibilities for even graver consequences. The hypothesis only requires a level of uncertainty that suggests the possibilities for an alternate, more undesirable outcome. Upon analyzing both statements and their logical relationship, it is not possible to conclude definitively that the truth of the premise automatically guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. While it may be true that the situation or experience was 'bad,' this does not necessarily equate to the hypothesis (it could have been worse). The hypothesis, being speculative, depends on a variety of factors, context, comparisons, and what one might consider as the range of worse outcomes. In conclusion, the truth of the premise does not necessarily lead to the truth of the hypothesis. The hypothesis, in this case, is an independent statement that acknowledges the premise but involves an element of speculation and comparison to other possible outcomes. While the premise does influence the understanding of the hypothesis, it does not strictly entail the hypothesis's truth."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

This will provide a strong base for the potential romantic relationship. Step 2: Choose the right moment Look for an appropriate time to discuss the topic, when both of you are comfortable, relaxed, and have some privacy.

Article: Many thousands of Chinese are studying at schools in the United States. And writer Liel Leibovitz says the students are following an example that began in the eighteen seventies. Mr. Leibovitz and writer Matthew Miller joined forces to tell the story of the students in their book, \\"Fortunate Sons.\\" The book says China sent one hundred twenty boys from 1872 to 1875 to America to learn about developments that could help modernize their country. Mr. Leibovitz got the idea for the book about the boys a few years ago when he was traveling with his wife in China. Mr. Leibovitz learned that Qing government sent a whole delegation of boys to learn the ways of the West. The goal was for them to return to China and help their country. The book says the boys received their American training in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It must have been a very good education. Mr. Leibovitz says the first prime minister of the Chinese Republic completed this program. And so did the first engineer to build a large-scale railroad without foreign help. The same was true of the fathers of Chinese education, diplomacy and the Navy. The book-writers had only to open some boxes containing the writings of these men to learn about them. Their notebooks, journals, letters and postcards were in English. Mr. Leibovitz said he was lucky to have so much information from events that took place long ago. The students returned to China after about nine years. They no longer spoke Mandarin well enough to answer questions. Police welcomed them home by putting them in jail. The young men were released after about a week. But they were given low-level jobs. Mr Leibovitz says it took about ten years for them to rise to higher positions. He said their story continues today with large numbers of Chinese studying in the United States. Question: Which of the following is Not true according to the passage? - Many thousands of Chinese are studying at schools in America. - Some of the boys received their American training in California. - Police welcomed the boys home by putting them in jail. - One of the boys became the father of Chinese education.

It is a fundamental aspect of almost all animals, including vertebrates (animals with a backbone) and invertebrates (animals without a backbone). Tortoises (B), crocodiles (C), and elephants (E) are all vertebrates in the animal kingdom. They possess spinal cords, brains, and nerves that make up their respective nervous systems. Insects (H) are invertebrates but also have a nervous system that comprises a dorsal, segmented nerve cord, ganglia (clusters of neurons), and peripheral nerves extending to different body parts. Sponges (D), placozoans (F), and mesozoans (G) are exceptions: as simple multicellular animals, they lack a well-defined nervous system. Sponges have a simple system comprising cells called choanocytes that respond to stimuli, but they do not have nerves and connecting structures. Placozoans and mesozoans are also simple organisms lacking a nervous system altogether.

Questa espressione si riferisce al coraggio e alla perseveranza necessari per superare gli ostacoli nella vita e raggiungere obiettivi importanti, come metaforicamente raggiungere le stelle. Attraverso impegno e tenacia, possiamo affrontare le difficoltà e trovare la forza di superarle, raggiungendo alla fine le nostre aspirazioni più elevate. Da notare che il latino è una lingua morta, tuttavia, è ancora utilizzata in contesti accademici, giuridici e religiosi. La frase \\"Per aspera ad astra\\" è stata anche usata come motto in molte istituzioni e organizzazioni in vari settori, come la scienza, l'esplorazione spaziale, e le arti, sottolineando la comune ricerca dell'umanità per la conoscenza, l'avanzamento, e lo sviluppo. Nel corso della storia, il latino è stato ampiamente considerato una lingua prestigiosa associata all'erudizione e all'alta cultura. Durante il periodo dell'Impero romano, il latino era parlato da milioni di persone in Europa, Asia e Africa. Divenne anche la lingua franca degli intellettuali e delle classi dirigenti in Europa, e rimase in uso come lingua colta fino al XVIII secolo. Anche se il latino è una lingua che non viene più parlata come prima lingua da alcuna comunità, la sua influenza e il suo impatto sulle lingue moderne è ancora evidente. Ad esempio, il latino ha avuto un impatto significativo sulle lingue romanze come l'italiano, il francese, lo spagnolo e il portoghese, che sono tutte derivate in una certa misura dal latino vulgare. Molti termini nelle scienze, nella medicina, nella filosofia, nella religione e nelle arti provengono anche dal latino.

The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (1939). Originally named the \\"Bat-Man\\", the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader, the Dark Knight, and the World's Greatest Detective. The first Batman story, \\"The Case of the Chemical Syndicate\\", was published in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). Finger said, \\"Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps\\", and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals. Batman proved a hit character, and he received his own solo title in 1940 while continuing to star in Detective Comics. By that time, Detective Comics was the top-selling and most influential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company's other major hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success. The two characters were featured side-by-side as the stars of World's Finest Comics, which was originally titled World's Best Comics when it debuted in fall 1940. Creators including Jerry Robinson and Dick Sprang also worked on the strips during this period. Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved. Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character's jawline more pronounced, and lengthened the ears on the costume. \\"About a year later he was almost the full figure, my mature Batman\\", Kane said. Batman's characteristic utility belt was introduced in Detective Comics #29 (July 1939), followed by the boomerang-like batarang and the first bat-themed vehicle, the Batplane, in #31 (Sept. 1939). The character's origin was revealed in #33 (Nov. 1939), unfolding in a two-page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by the death of his parents. Written by Finger, it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. Days later, at their grave, the child vows that \\"by the spirits of my parents [I will] avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals\\". The early, pulp-inflected portrayal of Batman started to soften in Detective Comics #38 (April 1940) with the introduction of Robin, Batman's junior counterpart. Robin was introduced, based on Finger's suggestion, because Batman needed a \\"Watson\\" with whom Batman could talk. Sales nearly doubled, despite Kane's preference for a solo Batman, and it sparked a proliferation of \\"kid sidekicks\\". The first issue of the solo spin-off series Batman was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent enemies, the Joker and Catwoman, but for a story in which Batman shoots some monstrous giants to death. That story prompted editor Whitney Ellsworth to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun. By 1942, the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the Batman mythos. In the years following World War II, DC Comics \\"adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de-emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy\\". The impact of this editorial approach was evident in Batman comics of the postwar period; removed from the \\"bleak and menacing world\\" of the strips of the early 1940s, Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a \\"bright and colorful\\" environment.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was the new direction well received?","output":"The provided information does not contain a direct quote addressing whether the new direction was well received, so I cannot answer the question using a quote from the given text."},{"instruction":"Q:I have a new situation: Jacob and Thomas were conducting an experiment in a chemistry class. The goal of the experiment was to identify the strength of unknown acids by examining the products formed in a chemical reaction. After they completed the experiment, Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid, while Thomas concluded that he was given a weak acid. But I can use this background: The stronger of two acids will have a higher Ka than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for Ka spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, pKa is more frequently used, where pKa = −log10 Ka. Stronger acids have a smaller pKa than weaker acids. Experimentally determined pKa at 25 °C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material. What is an answer for this question: Which person's acid, Jacob's or Thomas's, will have a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Jacob's acid will have a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid. This is because Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid, which means it has a higher Ka (acid dissociation constant) compared to the weak acid that Thomas concluded he has. A higher Ka indicates a greater tendency for the acid to lose a proton (H+) and form the conjugate base. Since a stronger acid has a higher Ka, it also has a smaller pKa value (pKa = -log10 Ka). Therefore, the stronger acid (Jacob's) will have a greater concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) relative to the acid molecule itself, resulting in a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid when compared to the weaker acid (Thomas's)."},{"instruction":"Write a text based on this summary: dumped nz bowler tuffey facing misconduct charge Text:","output":"Title: Dumped New Zealand Cricketer Tuffey Faces Misconduct Charge In a recent development, twenty-nine-year-old New Zealand cricketer Daryl Tuffey, who was recently dropped from the national squad, is now facing a misconduct charge. The fast bowler, who has represented the Black Caps in 26 Test matches and 94 One-Day Internationals (ODIs), has had a rocky career with a series of injuries and disciplinary issues. This recent charge is only the latest in a long line of controversies and issues plaguing the star bowler's career. The New Zealand Cricket (NZC) organization has not made any specific comments regarding the nature of the alleged misconduct incident; however, it has been speculated that Tuffey was involved in inappropriate behavior during a recent training session. This incident appears to be the final straw for NZC, who is taking swift and decisive action to address the situation. Consequently, NZC has decided to drop Tuffey from the team and is currently investigating the misconduct allegations further. The decision to drop Tuffey comes at a difficult time for the player, as well as the team. The Black Caps have been struggling to find a winning formula in the recent past, with a string of poor performances in both Test matches and ODIs. By all accounts, the team is currently in desperate need of experienced players to turn its fortunes around. Tuffey, despite his various disciplinary issues, was still considered an essential part of the squad and his dismissal from the Black Caps is being viewed as both a loss and a setback for New Zealand cricket. Throughout his career, Daryl Tuffey has shown moments of brilliance, but at the same time, a lack of discipline and professionalism on and off the field has continued to tarnish his image. There have been numerous incidents in the past where Tuffey has been disciplined and subsequently reinstated, but it seems that the NZC has run out of patience with his ongoing antics; a fact highlighted by the organization's decision to not only sideline him but also investigate the misconduct allegations in earnest. This recent controversy has led experts to consider whether Tuffey's New Zealand cricket career is facing its final curtain. With a reputation as a troubled and unreliable player, it is increasingly unlikely that he will ever don the Black Caps jersey again. Tuffey's teammates and supporters were undoubtedly saddened by this latest development but are also recognizing the need for the team and the NZC to move forward without distraction. Despite the ongoing investigations, Daryl Tuffey has maintained a low profile and has not released any public statements regarding his dismissal from the team or the subsequent misconduct allegations. It is unclear whether any further action will be taken against the bowler, but should any new evidence of misconduct emerge, there is little doubt that the consequences for Tuffey's cricket career will be severe. In conclusion, the recent developments involving Daryl Tuffey have created shockwaves throughout the New Zealand cricket community. The dismissal and misconduct charges against Tuffey have raised a series of questions about the core values and ethics that define the character of the game and its players. As the NZC continues to investigate the allegations against Tuffey, it is hoped that this matter will serve as a stark reminder of the responsibility that comes with being in the international spotlight and the consequences of failing to uphold the highest standards of professionalism and discipline."},{"instruction":"What type of details about eric lucero can be gathered from the following bio?

It's ultimately what you want it to be and achieves what you want it to. But let's also be honest: Yoga's arrival into the mainstream has also come with less-than-beneficial undercurrents. For many, the practice of yoga has come to mean spending exorbitant amounts of money on classes in upscale studios and outfitting oneself with the latest name-brand apparel. For many besides, it’s also come to mean body shame. The message that “your body isn't right for yoga” isn’t just the product of advertisements depicting unattainable ideals and the sight of your classmates striking impossible-looking poses. It comes from on high. Following last year’s recall of too-sheer yoga pants, Lululemon’s founder and then-CEO, Chip Wilson, told Bloomberg, “Frankly some women’s bodies just actually don’t work for [our pants].” (He resigned soon after the comments.) This followed a July 2013 post on Lululemon’s Facebook page: “Our product and design strategy is built around creating products for our target guest in our size range of 2-12. While we know that doesn't work for everyone and recognize fitness and health come in all shapes and sizes, we've built our business, brand and relationship with our guests on this formula.” In light of all this, it can seem that the central spiritual elements of yoga have taken a backseat to commercialism and striving for “perfect” bodies. It’s certainly easy to see yoga simply as a form of exercise. It looks like exercise, it feels like exercise, and it provides all the attendant boons of a dynamic and rigorous workout. The hard work, though, is in dialing back those familiar patterns to make room for the deeper, longer-lasting blessings yoga brings. Of course, no one is qualified to tell others what personal practice should amount to. If a “better” body is your goal, go for it. If a yoga studio is your favorite place to pick up dates, so be it. The following slideshow simply trains the lens on what yoga could be: A means for self-acceptance; for taking a holistic approach to your health; for retaining composure in the face of everyday stress. Here are 10 tips for tuning out the noise and keeping your yoga practice grounded. Remember: The breath is your lodestar. When the connection slips, gets strenuous or choppy, back off. Take the pose back to its basic root, fold to child’s pose -- whatever is needed to recover a smooth, deep, controlled breath. Without absolute attention on the breath -- an endeavor that for most requires the full breadth of one’s will -- it's not yoga. It's calisthenics. Many poses are enhanced with a specific Dristhi, or a soft, focused gaze. For example, in triangle pose, the Dristhi is optimally on the skyward hand. Respect these nuances. Remove the urge to check out your neighbor, the pretty painting on the wall, or anything else besides the small space you embody. Recognize that limberness, flexibility, strength, endurance—all forms of physical gain -- are only stepping stones to the potential returns of a regular practice. This means abandoning false standards, such as placing strictures on yourself to meet every practice with advanced poses, or to 'get better.' That, too, will simply come. Cultivate acceptance, nurturing, and surrender while you still have a choice. We all age, after all. Though you may be capable of more, if an easy pose feels good sometimes it’s best just to enjoy it. Respect savasana, or corpse pose. Some see the typical ending pose as a formality, something to be breezed through or ignored. Stay in as long as you can. (Be honest and take stock: Will 15 extra minutes truly throw your day out of whack?) The stillness that one gathers while in corpse pose seals the entire preceding practice; it’s the true and subtle reward for all the hard work of strenuous sequences. At its best, it’s an observation of and conversation with one’s inner thoughts and intentions. It's much more than the roughly 60 minutes' mat time. It’s approaching daily interactions and decisions with calm, calculated, compassionate measure. It's not about removing passion and becoming totally even-keeled (although some argue it is). Take an extra half-minute to chat with your barista or pay an old friend a call. Connect with others. When possible (that is, when you can comfortably move in and out of a pose), close your eyes. This keeps your precious energy focused inward rather than on others. Without the balance-boosting benefits of sight, the mind creates fresh pathways to calibrate the body as it moves through space. Over time, you can begin to truly listen to your joints, ligaments, tendons, fascia, and muscles -- all the minute firings that happen when balancing or holding a pose. The benefits for this one are enormous. Use the positive influence of your practice to bring real change to unhealthy habits, detrimental relationships, destructive thought patterns. The net here is so wide it's almost silly trying to cast it. We’re all so different, as are our goals and setbacks. But everyone could gain from counting their blessings; and yoga cultivates self-trust, as well as inner voice. Be brave when that voice speaks up and strive to act on bringing about the kind of life you want to live. For the complete list of tips on Keeping Your Yoga Grounded, go to TheActiveTimes.com.

The sentence reads: \\"The woman tried to put the books on the couches but the...\\" Let's examine both options: 1. \\"couches were too large\\" - A large couch would actually provide more surface area to put books. So saying the couches were too large that prevents her from putting books on it doesn't really make sense in this context. 2. \\"books were too large\\" - Now, this does make more sense. If the books were too large, then it would logically explain why the woman had difficulty in placing them on the couches. The large size of the books could cause instability or could simply be too big to fit comfortably on the couch without falling off. Based on these considerations, the sentence should correctly end as follows: \\"The woman tried to put the books on the couches but the books were too large.\\" This makes most sense, providing a logical reason as to why the woman was unable to put the books on the couches."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Mark: We just got to Malaga, 24 degrees and sunny!

Liz asks how long the travel took, showing her curiosity and concern about Mark and his journey. 3. The conversation order seems slightly jumbled, as we see Mark's reply \\"about 6 hours\\" after Liz comments on the view. This could be due to delays in responses or a simple misordering. 4. Liz asks if the view is from his balcony, indicating she sees something that Mark might have shared—maybe a photo of the view. 5. Mark confirms and also shares about the amenity his hotel provides, namely the shampoo things in the bathroom. This gives an impression that Mark is having a good time already. 6. Liz jokingly asks Mark to bring back some shampoos for her. 7. Mark tells Liz that there aren't dressing gowns at the hotel, demonstrating more about his stay at the hotel. 8. Liz reacts humorously by suggesting he find a new hotel due to the lack of dressing gowns, showing their playful sibling relationship. 9. Mark dismisses Liz's joke and then makes a promise to get Liz a dressing gown for her birthday, indicating his affection for his sister. 10. Liz responds by pointing out that a dressing gown in June would be unnecessary due to warm weather, maintaining the humorous tone. 11. There's further light-hearted teasing between them. 12.

Let me address them separately and provide you with the necessary information. 1. What happens if I change my android's MAC address to an existing one? Step 1: Identification of the issue Changing your Android device's MAC address to an existing one can cause IP and network conflicts. Step 2: Analyzing possible outcomes When two devices on the same network share the same MAC address, it may lead to following issues: a. Both devices could have erratic network connectivity. b. One device might not be able to connect to the network at all. c. The network router may repeatedly switch between both devices causing frequent disconnections. d. In some cases, it can lead to security concerns if the existing MAC address belongs to a device with access to sensitive information. 2.

The problems made it difficult for them to grow and be healthy. But don't worry, my little friend! We will learn how to help these plants, so they can be happy and healthy again. Let's solve their problems one by one! 1. Helping the Water Flow In this garden, sometimes the water didn't go away because the soil was not very good at letting it through. The plants didn't like this because their roots got too wet. To help them, we need to make the soil better by adding drainage. Drainage is like a secret path for the water, so it can go away easily and keep the plants' roots dry and strong. 2. Give Your Plants Space The plants in this garden were also feeling a bit crowded, like when you have too many friends over for a playdate. When plants are too close together, they can't grow big and strong. So, we need to move some of the plants to give them more space to play and grow. 3. Don't Over-Mulch The garden's caretaker wanted to keep the plants warm and cozy, so they added lots of mulch. Mulch is like a blanket that keeps the plants warm and prevents weeds from growing. But too much mulch can be a bad thing! It's like having too many blankets on your bed making you hot and sweaty. We need to remove some of the mulch so the plants can breathe and feel comfortable. 4. Say Goodbye to Dead or Sick Plants Sometimes plants can get sick or die, which makes the other plants in the garden very sad. To help the other plants stay healthy, we need to cut off the dead or sick plants and take them away from the garden. 5. Water Wisely The plants in this garden were sometimes given too much water, which made their roots soggy and sad. Just like you don't want to drink too much water all at once, the plants need the right amount of water too. Remember to water your plants carefully, so they can stay happy and hydrated. 6. Plant Properly The garden's caretaker sometimes planted the plants too deep in the ground. The plants didn't like this because they couldn't reach the sunlight and air. To help the plants, make sure you don't plant them too deep, so they can grow tall and strong towards the sun. And so, my little friend, by following these tips, we can help the plants in the garden be happy and healthy again. When we take good care of them, they will grow strong, beautiful, and bring joy to everyone who visits the garden."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Question: what is the book of verses james frey reads in his book?

It was one of the greatest achievements in Agassi's long and successful career. Andre Agassi turned professional in 1986 at the age of sixteen. His career soon took off, and in 1990, Agassi was famous around the world, though never having won an important tennis championship. Many people thought he was famous more for his long blond hair and colorful tennis shirts than for his tennis skills. They wondered if he could really win an important tournament. In 1992, Agassi proved _ wrong by winning one of the greatest prizes in world tennis--the Wimbledon singles final. His first attempt to win this tournament had been in 1987, but he lost his opening game. He then refused to take part in Wimbledon for the next three years. He said his reason for not playing was that the officials refused to allow him to wear his colorful shirts, but some people said it was because he was afraid to lose. After several more championship victories, Agassi's luck began to run out. By 1997, the year of his marriage to a movie actress--- Brooke Shields, Agassi's ranking had dropped to 141stin the world. Many people thought his career was over. Agassi and Shields divorced two years later, and Agassi made a comeback with a new trainer, a new hairstyle, and new determination. In 1999, he won both the French Open and the U.S. Open and ended the year back as the world's number one. By 2003, he had earned more than 27 million in prize money, making him one of the most successful tennis players of all times.

USA TODAY Red Sox right fielder Mookie Betts battles fans in the right field seats for a ball hit by the Astros' Jose Altuve. Umpires ruled the fans interfered with Betts and Altuve was called out. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports) HOUSTON -- He won't hide in anonymity like Steve Bartman, or be famous like Jeffrey Maier, but Troy Caldwell certainly will be forever known in Houston if the Astros don't reach the World Series. The Boston Red Sox made Caldwell infamous overnight Wednesday by knocking off the Astros, 8-6, and taking a commanding 3-1 lead in the American League Championship Series, with a replay review that may be debated forever in Texas. Caldwell was just an anonymous Astros fan sitting in the first row of Section 152 in the right-field seats at Minute Maid Park. Jose Altuve hit a drive deep to right field. Caldwell jumped up and stuck out his hand, hoping to catch the ball. Red Sox right fielder Mookie Betts jumped high, trying to catch it himself. Caldwell's hand knocked against Betts' glove. No one caught the ball. The sellout crowd of 43,277 went wild, believing it was a homer, and Caldwell started cheering himself. Only for the stadium to watch in disbelief as right-field umpire Joe West shot his arm up in the air. Out! Caldwell stood in horror, screaming along with everyone else as they waited 3 minutes, 13 seconds - which seemed like an eternity - for the replay review. The decision came. The call was confirmed: Spectator interference. Out. Here's Troy Caldwell. He was the fan who was ruled to have interfered with the Astros potential home run ball. “I'm going to need security to escort me out of here if the Astros don't come back to win this.” pic.twitter.com/IXE2uEzSoW — Matt Young (@Chron_MattYoung) October 18, 2018 Replay after replay was shown on the huge scoreboard, and on TV sets across America, but it was virtually impossible to tell if the ball was over the fence or just short. There was no conclusive evidence. The call stood, and the sellout crowd went berserk. “After viewing all relevant angles,'' MLB said in a statement, “the replay official could not definitely determine that the spectator failed to reach out of the stands and over the playing field, clearly preventing the fielder from catching the ball. “The call stands, the batter is out.'' The Astros were livid, with George Springer, who had been standing on first base, slamming his helmet to the ground. “I'm not sure if Mookie makes that catch,'' Astros manager A.J. Hinch said during an in-game interview on TBS. “He's a great athlete, but how it's an assumed out is unbelievable. … “Jose paid kind of (the) ultimate price for something out of his control.'' Caldwell, who did round after round of interviews for the next few innings, spent the rest of the game praying. “I'll need security to escort me out of here,'' Caldwell told reporters, “if the Astros don't come back to win this. … I promise you I didn't do anything wrong.'' MORE MLB: Dodgers learn valuable lesson - they can win big without long ball Clayton Kershaw dominates as Dodgers move to brink of World Series Then again, neither did Bartman, who simply was trying to catch a foul ball in the stands in the eighth inning of Game 6 of the 2003 NLCS between the Cubs and Marlins, only to keep left fielder Moises Alou from catching the ball. The Cubs blew the lead, lost the game, and the series. Bartman, who was escorted from Wrigley Field and received death threats, was never again seen publicly, living his life in anonymity. Maier, just a 12-year-old in 1996, reached over the wall in right field at Yankee Stadium in Game 1 of the ALCS. He snared Derek Jeter's fly ball just as Baltimore Orioles right fielder Tony Tarasco waited at the wall to catch it. There was no replay then, and right-field umpire Richie Garcia called it a homer. The Yankees won the game, the ALCS, and the World Series. It was the start of a Yankees dynasty, and Maier became a hero in the Bronx. The Astros did everything possible to make sure that Caldwell was neither hero nor goat in their zany back-and-forth game. The teams scored in every inning, and three times in the same inning, trading jabs like pugilists in a prize fight, with five different lead changes and ties. The Red Sox know they will be facing Cy Young candidate Justin Verlander on Thursday for Game 5, while the Red Sox have no idea who they'll be starting. They were scheduled to start ace Chris Sale, but he's still weak, having lost weight after being hospitalized with stomach problems. “He's feeling better compared to [Tuesday],'' manager Alex Cora said, “but physically he's not there yet. So I think if necessary, he'll pitch Game 6. He feels that he'll be ready for that one.'' And for Game 5? “I'm learning very, very quick that in the playoffs,'' Cora said, “you live for today.'' Then again, the Red Sox may not even need Sale to pitch again until Tuesday, Oct. 23: Game 1 of the World Series, at Fenway Park, against the National League champions.

Then, he noticed that crew chief Joe West, who was manning the right-field line in Wednesday's critical Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, had called fan interference and ruled Altuve out. COLUMNIST: Astros wronged by call on fan interference, only on HoustonChronicle.com As a lengthy review dragged on, Caldwell had a sinking feeling that he might be in trouble. The review upheld West's original call that Caldwell interfered with Red Sox rightfielder Mookie Betts. Just like that, a potential game-tying home run was ruled an out. Two batters later, the Red Sox got out of the inning without suffering any damage except for what Caldwell was experiencing in the front row of Section 152. \\"I'm going to need security to escort me out of here if the Astros don't come back to win this,\\" said Caldwell, who grew up in Houston but currently lives in Atlanta and flew to town just for this game. NOT ESPIONAGE: Astros were doing surveillance against Indians, Red Sox, MLB says West said neither the ball nor Betts' glove had crossed the railing when the interference took place. \\"Here's the whole play,\\" West said. \\"They hit the ball to right field, he (Betts) jumped up to try to make a catch, a fan interfered with him over the playing field.

At least early in Wednesday's game, Caldwell had the support of Astros fans sitting around him, who were busier yelling at West than they were bothering Caldwell.

A month; (B). not enough information; (C). A day; (D). A hour; Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. Question: Puskas's daughter's soccer game probably lasted Answer: A:","output":"C. A day; Since soccer games typically last around 90 minutes, and considering the options given, a day seems to be the most appropriate answer. It doesn't take a month, and an hour would be slightly shorter than the usual length of a soccer game. \\"Not enough information\\" could be a tempting choice; however, given the context, a day is a reasonable estimate for the duration of a soccer game."},{"instruction":"Q:I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

While in New York, she discovers that Wilson is also living there. Instead of staying in Glenoak for the summer like she originally planned, she breaks up with Robbie and moves back to New York and starts dating Wilson. After getting advice from the Colonel, she decides to get a job in public service. When she ca n't become a police officer because she is not old enough, she applies for a position as a firefighter, and, after the Colonel pulls some strings, she gets into the firefighter program. When she starts training, she meets Ben Kinkirk, who is also in training. He comes over to her place and they kiss, which Wilson walks in on. The two break up and she returns home to California for a time, but on a trip to New York with Lucy, she reveals that she is moving back to New York to train to be a flight attendant. She begins dating a pilot, Jack, who is the same age as her father, though this does not last. She moves to Florida for a time to get away from her family. While in Florida, Mary runs into Carlos Rivera, a man she had met while volunteering at a homeless shelter years earlier, and who the Camdens took in during the holiday season. Carlos and Mary get married shortly after Lucy, and they reveal her pregnancy and the marriage to her family at that time. Her parents visit at the birth of her son, Charles Miguel \\"Charlie\\", named in honor of her and Carlos' late grandfathers. They eventually divorce and Carlos takes Charlie back to Puerto Rico when Mary gives her parental rights up. It is announced by Carlos when he attends Simon's wedding that the two are back together and that Mary is expecting twin girls.

Identify if any events support the fact of Mary's marriage to Carlos. - We have: \\"Carlos and Mary get married shortly after Lucy.\\" 4. Look for information confirming the marriage. - The passage continues with events in their life together, such as: \\"They reveal her pregnancy and the marriage to her family at that time.\\" 5. Check if they had children, further solidifying the marriage. - Mary and Carlos do have children: \\"Her parents visit at the birth of her son, Charles Miguel \\"Charlie\\", named in honor of her and Carlos' late grandfathers.\\" - They also eventually have twin daughters: \\"It is announced by Carlos when he attends Simon's wedding that the two are back together and that Mary is expecting twin girls.\\" Based on the information in the passage, we can conclude that Mary Camden marries Carlos Rivera in 7th Heaven."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Picture a wasteland of computer monitors and TVs, stretching as far as the eye can see. Imagine towers of boxes, all of them filled with broken glass and old electronic devices. Technology graveyards like this can be found in communities across the country. Experts say that landfills and warehouses will overflow unless a plan for the disposal and reuse of electronics is put into place. \\"We can't put electronics and glass aside and tell ourselves we'll deal with them later,\\" Lauren Roman, managing director of Transparent Planet said. Roman's group works to improve the disposal of electronic waste. She says about 660 million pounds of tech trash is produced each year in the US. What's behind the tech trash pile-up? About ten years ago, major advances were made in computer and television technology. Manufacturers began producing devices like flat-paneled LCDs and plasma screen monitors. These new products provide a clearer image and take up less space than older models. It goes without saying that consumers choose them rather than heavy, glass-based technologies. The new electronics are built with materials that are difficult to recycle. In addition, the new products have decreased the demand for recycled parts from the older monitors and screens. Older, heavier computer monitors and TVs used glass-based components called CRTs. CRTs have a high lead content and can be environmentally risky if not recycled properly. If crushed and put in landfills, the lead from CRTs could seep into groundwater and rivers, harming the water supply. For many years, plants and recycling programs safely processed CRTs. The recycled CRTs were reused in the construction of new monitors. Monitors being made today do not use glass tubes. \\"People are returning old-style TVs with CRTs, but no new ones are being made,\\" said Linnel. This is creating an imbalance in the amount of glass being disposed of and recycled properly. Many recycling companies have shut down. Others no longer have the resources or space to process... Question: What is the main idea of the passage? - New technologies cause trouble for recyclers. - Experts are trying to solve the tech trash problem. - New technology has both advantages and disadvantages - CRTs from old computer monitors harm the earth.
