Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"France, a country in Western Europe, is well-known for its rich history, culture, and global influence. It is one of the largest countries in Europe, sharing borders with eight neighboring countries, including Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Italy, Monaco, Spain, and Andorra. France’s capital, Paris, serves as the country's political, cultural, and economic hub, while other major cities such as Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Nice also play significant roles. France is a key member of international organizations such as the European Union (EU) and the United Nations (UN), as well as being one of the founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The leader mentioned with respect to France is François Hollande, who served as the 24th President of the French Republic from 2012 to 2017. Hollande was born in Rouen, France, on August 12, 1954, and was educated at the prestigious National School of Administration (ENA), where some of the top French civil servants, politicians, and business leaders have been trained. Before becoming the President, Hollande had an active political career as a member of France's Socialist Party, holding various positions. He was the First Secretary of the Socialist Party from 1997 to 2008, Mayor of Tulle from 2001 to 2008, and President of the General Council of Corrèze from 2008 to 2012. In 2012, Hollande competed in the presidential race against the incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy, who was representing the center-right Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party. With the French economy struggling at that time and increasing dissatisfaction among the population, Hollande centered his campaign on the promise of combating unemployment, reducing the national deficit, and boosting economic growth. After two rounds of voting, Hollande emerged as the winner with 51.6% of the vote, becoming the first socialist president of France since François Mitterrand, who served from 1981 to 1995. During his presidency, Hollande faced several significant challenges, such as the rise in terrorist incidents in France, for which he implemented state-of-emergency measures and reinforced French military efforts. Some of his major accomplishments include legalizing same-sex marriage and adoption, introducing labor and tax reforms, as well as participating in global efforts towards addressing climate change by hosting the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, where the Paris Agreement was signed. François Hollande served a single term as president, and in 2017, he chose not to seek re-election, making him the first incumbent president not to stand for re-election in France's Fifth Republic. Emmanuel Macron, his former economic minister, succeeded him as the President of France. In summary, the data given pertains to France, a key nation in Western Europe, and its leader François Hollande, who was the President of the country from 2012 to 2017. Hollande's presidency was marked by efforts aimed at stimulating economic growth, enacting social reforms, and ensuring national security amidst the rise of terrorist attacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She is best known as the lead character Dawn O'Keefe in the comedy-horror film \\"Teeth\\" and the comedy \\"The Big Bad Swim\\".  - A feature film is a film (also called a movie, motion picture or just film) with a running time long enough to be considered the principal or sole film to fill a program. The notion of how long this should be has varied according to time and place. According to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the American Film Institute, and the British Film Institute, a feature film runs for 40 minutes or longer, while the Screen Actors Guild states that it is 80 minutes or longer.  - Horror film is a film genre that seeks to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on their fears. Inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror films have existed for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction and thriller genres.  - An independent film or indie film is a feature film that is produced outside of the major film studio system, in addition to being produced and distributed by independent entertainment agencies.  - Teeth is a 2007 black comedy horror film written and directed by Mitchell Lichtenstein . The movie stars Jess Weixler , Hale Appleman , and John Hensley , and was produced by Lichtenstein on a budget of US  2 million . The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19 , 2007 , and was distributed by Roadside Attractions for a limited release in the United States . Despite being positively received by critics , the film had an international box office gross of  2,340,110 , barely earning back its budget . At Sundance , Weixler received the Grand Jury Prize for Acting .  - The Big Bad Swim is a 2006 American independent film about a group of adults who enroll in an adult education beginner's swim class.

During his lifetime, he was better known as the personal assistant of actor Henry Irving and business manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London, which Irving owned.  - A film festival is an organised, extended presentation of films in one or more cinemas or screening venues, usually in a single city or region. Increasingly, film festivals show some films outdoors. Films may be of recent date and, depending upon the festival's focus, can include international and domestic releases. Some festivals focus on a specific film-maker or genre (e.g., film noir) or subject matter (e.g., horror film festivals). A number of film festivals specialise in short films of a defined maximum length. Film festivals are typically annual events. Some film historians do not consider Film Festivals as official releases of film, like Jerry Beck. The best known film festivals are the Venice Film Festival, the Cannes Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, and the Berlin International Film Festival, the latter being the largest film festival worldwide, based on attendance. The Venice Film Festival is the oldest major festival. The Melbourne International Film Festival is the largest film festival in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the oldest in the world.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the European honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea, presently considered as a clade Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven to nine recognized families, though many are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.  - A gill is a respiratory organ found in many aquatic organisms that extracts dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide. The gills of some species, such as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment.  - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans.  Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments.  - The Chalcididae are a moderate-sized family within the Chalcidoidea, composed mostly of parasitoids and a few hyperparasitoids. The family is apparently polyphyletic, though the different subfamilies may each be monophyletic, and some may be elevated to family status in the near future. As presently defined, there are over 85 genera and over 1455 species worldwide. They are often black with yellow, red, or white markings, rarely brilliantly metallic, with a robust mesosoma and very strong sculpturing. The hind femora are often greatly enlarged, with a row of teeth or serrations along the lower margin.  - A proleg is a small, fleshy, stub structure found on the ventral surface of the abdomen of most larval forms of insects of the order Lepidoptera, though they can also be found on other larval insects such as sawflies and a few types of flies. In all the orders in which they appear, mainly Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera, prolegs of any form evolved independently of each other by convergent evolution.  - Arachnids are a class (Arachnida) of joint-legged invertebrate animals (arthropods), in the subphylum Chelicerata. All arachnids have eight legs, although the front pair of legs in some species has converted to a sensory function, while in other species, different appendages can grow large enough to take on the appearance of extra pairs of legs. The term is derived from the Greek word (\\"aráchn\\"), meaning \\"spider\\". Spiders are the largest order in the class.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.  - The mesosoma is the middle part of the body, or tagma, of arthropods whose body is composed of three parts, the other two being the prosoma and the metasoma. It bears the legs, and, in the case of winged insects, the wings.  - The ovipositor is an organ used by some animals for the laying of eggs.  In insects an ovipositor consists of a maximum of three pairs of appendages. The details and morphology of the ovipositor vary, but typically its form is adapted to functions such as transmitting the egg, preparing a place for it, and placing it properly. In some insects the organ is used merely to attach the egg to some surface, but in many parasitic species (primarily in wasps and other Hymenoptera) it is a piercing organ as well.  - The Archaeognatha are an order of wingless insects, also known as jumping bristletails. They are among the least evolutionarily changed insects, appearing in the Middle Devonian period along with the arachnids. They are known from both body and trace fossils (the latter including body imprints and trackways) throughout the remainder of the Paleozoic Era. The name Archaeognatha is derived from Greek, \\"archaeos\\" meaning \\"ancient\\" and \\"gnatha\\" meaning \\"jaw\\". This refers to the articulation of the mandibles, which has a single condyle, where all higher insects have two. An alternative name, Microcoryphia, comes from the Greek \\"micro\\", meaning \\"small\\", and \\"coryphia\\", meaning head.  - A wasp is any insect of the order Hymenoptera and suborder Apocrita that is neither a bee nor an ant. The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a clade; wasps as a group do not form a clade, but are paraphyletic with respect to bees and ants.  - A carapace is a dorsal (upper) section of the exoskeleton or shell in a number of animal groups, including arthropods, such as crustaceans and arachnids, as well as vertebrates, such as turtles and tortoises. In turtles and tortoises, the underside is called the plastron.  - The metasoma is the posterior part of the body, or tagma, of arthropods whose body is composed of three parts, the other two being the prosoma and the mesosoma. In insects, it contains most of the digestive tract, respiratory system, and circulatory system, and the apical segments are typically modified to form genitalia. In a few of the most primitive insects (the Archaeognatha), the metasomal segments bear small, articulated appendages called \\"styli\\", which are often considered to be vestigial. There are also pre-apical appendages in most insect orders, called cerci, which may be multi-segmented and almost resembling a posterior pair of antennae; these may be variously modified, or lost entirely. Otherwise, most adult insects lack appendages on the metasoma, though many larval insects (e.g., caterpillars) have some form of appendages, such as prolegs or, in aquatic insects, gills.  - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.  - The Leucospidae ( sometimes incorrectly spelled Leucospididae ) are a small , specialized group within the Chalcidoidea , composed exclusively of ectoparasitoids of aculeate wasps or bees . They are typically mimics of bees or stinging wasps , often black with yellow , red , or white markings , sometimes metallic , with a robust mesosoma and very strong sculpturing . The hind femora are often greatly enlarged , with a row of teeth or serrations along the lower margin as in Chalcididae . The female ovipositor is sometimes short , but if not , it is recurved and lies along the dorsal side of the metasoma , a unique feature . The males are also unusual , in the fusion of many of the metasomal segments to form a capsule - like \`\` carapace '' . Leucospids are generally rarely encountered except in areas where their hosts are abundant ; in the United States , the most common species is Leucospis affinis , which attacks nests of leafcutter bees .

What an incredible experience we had dining at the Culinary Gem! Right from the moment we walked through the door, we were greeted with warm smiles and an inviting ambiance that we knew meant we were in for an extraordinary meal. Our server, James, was an absolute delight. He was knowledgeable, attentive, and genuinely passionate about the food being served. You could feel the pride he had in presenting each and every dish. We started off with a complimentary amuse-bouche, which was a delightful surprise and began our gastronomical journey on a fantastic note. Our appetizers were nothing short of perfection. The beef tartare was impeccably seasoned and paired with thinly sliced baguette that had just the right crunch. The seared scallops, served on a bed of creamy cauliflower puree with a drizzle of truffle oil, were incredibly tender and bursting with flavor in each bite. Choosing our main courses proved to be difficult, as every dish sounded divine, but we finally settled on the pan-seared salmon and the lamb tagliata. The salmon had a beautiful crispy skin, while the moist, tender interior simply melted in our mouths. A beautiful medley of oven-roasted heirloom tomatoes and basil pesto completed the dish, resulting in a symphony of flavors and textures that pleased our palates immensely. The lamb tagliata truly stole the show, though. Each slice of succulent lamb was cooked to perfection and served with a side of creamy polenta and a delectable reduction sauce that brought everything together impeccably. We were truly in awe of the chef's ability to execute such brilliantly composed dishes. For dessert, we indulged in the most heavenly chocolate souffle we have ever had. The warm, gooey interior combined with a scoop of silky, rich vanilla ice cream was an absolute treat for our taste buds. The perfect finale to our unforgettable dining experience! Throughout our entire meal, James made sure our water and wine glasses were never empty, and his recommendations for each course were spot-on. We truly felt like royalty during our time at the Culinary Gem.

The restaurant's tastefully decorated interior was a breath of fresh air. With its warm lighting, comfortable seating, and lively atmosphere, it provided a perfect setting for a memorable dining experience. The menu presented an enticing array of dishes, and I was particularly delighted to see several vegetarian options that catered to different tastes and dietary preferences. Choosing from their extensive selection was quite a challenge, but with the knowledgeable and patient assistance of our server, Lisa, we managed to make our selections from their range of delicious appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Our appetizers, the crispy artichoke hearts and the seared sea scallops, set high expectations for the rest of the meal. The artichoke hearts were beautifully cooked, well-seasoned and served with a tangy dipping sauce that elevated the dish even further. The scallops were a divine combination of tender, succulent seafood with crispy, caramelized exterior. For the main course, I ordered the spinach and ricotta stuffed ravioli, and my dining companion opted for the pan-seared salmon. The ravioli was cooked to perfection, with delicate pasta encasing a flavorful blend of spinach and ricotta, all covered in a creamy garlic sauce that was simply heavenly. The salmon was equally impressive: fresh, flaky, and brilliantly complemented by a citrus beurre blanc sauce and roasted baby potatoes. Dessert was the pièce de résistance - a warm chocolate lava cake accompanied by a dollop of velvety vanilla bean ice cream. The combination of rich, molten chocolate and cool, sweet ice cream created a symphony of flavors and textures that left us speechless. Throughout the evening, the staff members demonstrated attentive professionalism, ensuring that our water glasses were always refilled, and our needs anticipated. Their genuine enthusiasm for their work and the food made us feel like honored guests. In conclusion, The Gourmet Garden exceeded all my expectations and has truly earned this five-star review.

The original text suggests that Rana communicated with a delegation of the Nepal Trans-Himalayan Trade Association, which is the only non-governmental organization that has trade relations with China. The main purpose of this conversation was for the delegation to inform Rana, who is most likely a minister, about the existing problems in the bilateral trade sector between the involved parties.

Once is a 2007 Irish romantic musical drama film written and directed by John Carney. The film stars Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova as two struggling musicians in Dublin, Ireland. Hansard and Irglova had previously performed music as the Swell Season, and composed and performed the film's original songs. Once spent years in development with the Irish Film Board and was made for a budget of EUR112,000. Once was met with extremely positive reviews from critics. Upon its March 2007 release in Ireland, RTE's Caroline Hennessy gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and termed it \\"an unexpected treasure\\". About the acting, this Irish reviewer commented, \\"Once has wonderfully natural performances from the two leads. Although musicians first and actors second, they acquit themselves well in both areas. Irglova, a largely unknown quantity alongside the well-known and either loved or loathed Hansard, is luminous.\\" Michael Dwyer of The Irish Times gave the film the same rating, calling it \\"irresistibly appealing\\" and noting that \\"Carney makes the point - without ever labouring it - that his protagonists are living in a changing city where the economic boom has passed them by. His keen eye for authentic locations is ... evident\\".  In May, on Ebert & Roeper, both Richard Roeper and guest critic Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave enthusiastic reviews. Phillips called it, \\"the most charming thing I've seen all year\\", \\"the Brief Encounter for the 21st century\\", his favorite music film since 1984's Stop Making Sense and said, \\"It may well be the best music film of our generation\\". Roeper referred to the film's recording studio scene as \\"more inspirational and uplifting than almost any number of Dreamgirls or Chicago or any of those multi-zillion dollar musical showstopping films. In its own way, it will blow you away.\\" Once won very high marks from U.S. critics; it is rated 97% \\"fresh\\" by the film review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes and scored a grade of 88 (\\"universal acclaim\\") according to Metacritic.  In late 2007, Amy Simmons of Time Out London wrote, \\"Carney's highly charged, urban mise-en-scene with its blinking street lamps, vacant shops and dishevelled bed-sits provides ample poetic backdrop for the film's lengthy tracking shots, epitomised in a sequence where the Girl walks to the corner shop in pyjamas and slippers while listening to one of the Guy's songs on her personal stereo. With outstanding performances from Hansard and new-comer Irglova, Carney has created a sublime, visual album of unassuming and self-assured eloquence.\\" The Telegraph's Sukhdev Sandhu said, \\"Not since Before Sunset has a romantic film managed to be as touching, funny or as hard to forget as Once. Like Before Sunset, it never outstays its welcome, climaxing on a note of rare charm and unexpectedness.\\"  The film appeared on many North American critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2007:  In 2008, the film placed third on Entertainment Weekly's \\"25 Best Romantic Movies of the Past 25 Years\\".","output":"This text is about the 2007 Irish romantic musical drama film \\"Once.\\" It was written and directed by John Carney, and stars Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova as two struggling musicians in Dublin, Ireland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima was born on 22 September 1976 in a poor suburb of Rio de Janeiro. Like most of his childhood friends, Ronaldo began his soccer career playing barefoot in the streets of his neighborhood. At the age of 14, he joined SCristovo soccer club and only two years later became the star of Cruzeiro Belo Horizonte scoring a total of 58 goals in 60 matches and earning himself a reputation for his explosive pace and outstanding finishing skills. His goal-scoring record and unusual _ led him to be included in the Brazilian World Cup winning team the following year. After the World Cup, many top European football clubs were trying to sign him. Many people, including Brazilian football legend Pele, referred to him as the most promising footballer of his generation. Since his transfer to Dutch team PSV Eindhoven, Ronaldo's biography is one of success after success. Two Copa America s, a UEFA Cup, a Dutch Cup, a Spanish League Cup, and two awards as best player in the world, all in the space of two years, are some of Ronaldo s impressive achievements. On arrival to Inter-Milan in 1997, Ronaldo became the idol of the local fans who refer to him as \\"il Fenomeno.\\" Since the 98 World Cup he has suffered two serious knee injuries that have severely limited his appearances. Just when people began to wonder whether Ronaldo would be able to continue with his football career, he proved to the world that he still could play. In the World Cup held in Korea and Japan, the magical striker won the Golden Shoe award and tied Pele's Brazilian record for career World Cup goals with 12. He helped Brazil capture its fifth World Cup championship on June 30 with a 2-0 win over Germany. It was the third time that Ronaldo has ever played in the World Cup. Question: We can infer from the passage that Ronaldo   _  . Options: A: comes from a rich family B: began to play soccer at 14 C: won a total of 58 goals at 14 D: became a star of Cruzeriro Belo Horizonte in 1992","output":"First, I will identify key information in the text relevant to the options provided.  1. \\"Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima was born on 22 September 1976 in a poor suburb of Rio de Janeiro.\\"  2. \\"At the age of 14, he joined SCristovo soccer club and only two years later became the star of Cruzeiro Belo Horizonte.\\" 3. \\"scoring a total of 58 goals in 60 matches\\" Now, I will go through each option and compare it to the key information found in the text. A: comes from a rich family - The text clearly states that Ronaldo was born in a \\"poor suburb,\\" so this option is false. B: began to play soccer at 14 - Ronaldo joined SCristovo soccer club at the age of 14, so it could be seen as the beginning of his formal soccer career. This option is true. C: won a total of 58 goals at 14 - Ronaldo scored 58 goals for Cruzeiro Belo Horizonte, but this happened \\"two years later\\" after joining SCristovo soccer club at the age of 14. Therefore, he achieved this when he was 16. This option is false. D: became a star of Cruzeriro Belo Horizonte in 1992 - We can estimate that this happened in 1992 (1976 + 16 years = 1992) for Ronaldo, so this option is true. There are two valid inferences from the passage: Ronaldo began to play soccer at 14 (B) and became a star of Cruzeriro Belo Horizonte in 1992 (D)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I hadn't heard from him for ages.  W: Well, I've been out of touch with most of my old friends. Only one or two still drop me a line occasionally.  Question: What does the woman mean?   - She has lost contact with most of her old friends.  - Letter writing is going out of style.  - She keeps in regular touch with her classmates. A:","output":"The woman means that she has lost contact with most of her old friends. In the dialogue, she mentions that she's been \\"out of touch\\" with the majority of them, which implies that they haven't been communicating for some time now. She does, however, note that there are one or two individuals who still send her messages occasionally. It's not uncommon for people to lose touch with friends from their past as they move on to different stages in their lives – engaging in new careers, relocating to various places, or starting families. The relationships we form during our school years, while significant and meaningful at that time, may not always be maintained at the same level of closeness or frequency when we encounter changes in our personal lives and priorities. Moreover, the woman does not suggest that letter writing is going out of style or that she keeps in regular touch with her classmates. While it's true that traditional letter writing might be less common nowadays due to advancements in technology and the prevalence of digital communication, this isn't the primary message conveyed by the woman in the dialogue. Her point is focused on the fact that she's lost contact with most of her old acquaintances and doesn't communicate with them regularly anymore, regardless of the mode of communication being used. To sum up, the woman's statement in the dialogue highlights her realization that she has lost contact with a majority of her old friends, with only a few exceptions who still reach out to her on occasion. This underscores the reality that it can be challenging to maintain relationships from the past when individuals are faced with new experiences and circumstances in their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Definition: Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Threat is a statement that someone will be hurt or harmed, especially if the person does not do something in particular. Q: Comment: Just look at Colorado's leftist leadership and their accomplishments, from useless magazine capacity limits, preventing the execution of a mass murderer, protecting foreign criminals, making the police department politically correct, and many others, all of those moves encouraged more crime, so why is this a surprise? A:","output":"To classify the given comment, let's break down its content and analyze its message. The comment discusses several actions or characteristics of Colorado's leftist leadership: 1. Useless magazine capacity limits 2. Preventing the execution of a mass murderer 3. Protecting foreign criminals 4. Making the police department politically correct The comment then states that these actions have encouraged more crime and questions why this result is surprising. Now, let's determine whether the comment is a threat or a non-threat. A threat involves expressing an intention of inflicting harm or causing some kind of danger on a person or group. In the provided comment, there is no direct intention to cause any harm or inflict danger on anyone. The message is expressing dissatisfaction with the political and legal decisions made by Colorado's leftist leadership and asserting that these decisions have led to increased crime rates. However, there is no statement suggesting that the commenter or someone else will harm anybody if certain actions are not taken. Based on this analysis, I would classify this comment as a non-threat since it does not contain any intentions to harm or inflict danger on others. It criticizes and questions political decisions but does not pose a direct threat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers.

Answer a question about this article: The greatest mosaic work of the Palaeologan renaissance in art is the decoration of the Chora Church in Constantinople. Although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except three panels, the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in Constantinople after the Hagia Sophia. They were executed around 1320 by the command of Theodore Metochites. The esonarthex has two fluted domes, specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of Christ. The southern one is called the Dome of the Pantokrator while the northern one is the Dome of the Theotokos. The most important panel of the esonarthex depicts Theodore Metochites wearing a huge turban, offering the model of the church to Christ. The walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ.

In 1998,on a three-week vacation journey in Nepal,Wood met a local headmaster who invited him to visit his school in a far mountain village.The experience changed Wood's life. \\"This headmaster had 450 students at the school,but he didn't have any books,\\" Wood said.\\"He had a library that was empty.\\" Wood promised to fill the library shelves and returned to the village one year later with some of his friends with 3000 books.And that was just the start.Later,Wood used some of his personal money to start Room to Read. He believes that world change begins with educated children.Today,the programme can be found in10 countries across Asia and Africa. Wood believes the key to the program's success is local support.While Room to Read gives away money and provides books,communities offer land and parents help build the school.Agnes,a Room to Read teacher in Zambia who also runs the library,is proud to say the literacy' at her school has improved.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art.

Definition: In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity. The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer. Input: Passage: Little documentary evidence of the games remains; contemporary and near-contemporary writings mostly record the major details and concentrate on the opening days. The poet Martial gives the most complete and only truly contemporary account in the form of his De Spectaculis (\\"On the Spectacles\\"), a somewhat sycophantic series of epigrams detailing the individual events of the games as an illustration of Titus' power and benevolence. Much of the work is concerned with praising Titus, and there have been difficulties with authenticating, dating and translating various portions, but Martial does give details of events not covered by other sources and the only known surviving complete record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena.The historian Suetonius was born in about AD 70, and started writing around AD 100. He was a child at the time of the games, but it is possible that he was born and raised in Rome, so he may have witnessed the inaugural games first-hand. His De Vita Caesarum (Lives of the Caesars, known also as The Twelve Caesars or Lives of the Twelve Caesars) probably completed around AD 117 to 127, includes some detail on the opening days of the games. Later in his history of Titus he reveals further information about the games. Suetonius' histories of the early Caesars have been criticised for being based on rumour and gossip rather than accurate historical sources, and he often reports from sources which contradict each other without attempting to analyse their quality or accuracy. However, he is generally regarded as a thorough scholar and has been praised for his balanced treatment of his subjects.The only other major source of information on the games is Cassius Dio who lived in the latter second and early third centuries. His History of Rome spans 80 books written in 22 years, but much of which are only fragments. He is noted for his attention to detail in administrative affairs, but for major events his writing can be merely impressionistic, with a greater emphasis put on his interpretation of the events' significance within the wider historical context rather than reporting details. His sources are varied: he relies on many of the major commentators but also seems to have paid close attention to public records. His account of the Titus games is not sourced.  Question: What is the full name of the person whose account of the Titus games is not sourced?

Question: \\"What might you have heard in Kazakhstan before the spread of Arabic?\\"  Context: \\"The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus.

Comet A enters the inner solar system on February 10, 2022, and leaves on February 20, 2022. This means that it would be within the inner solar system on February 19, 2022. However, Comet A is described as being very faint. Faint comets are generally not visible to the naked eye, as they do not emit or reflect enough light to be perceived without the aid of telescopic equipment. Comet B enters the inner solar system on February 18, 2022, and leaves on February 26, 2022. This also means that it would be within the inner solar system on February 19, 2022. However, Comet B is described as being very bright, which means it is likely to be visible to the naked eye. Bright comets emit or reflect a significant amount of light and are thus more easily observed without the need for telescopic equipment. Comet A's faint nature, along with it being within the inner solar system on February 19, 2022, suggests that it will not be visible to the naked eye on this date.

Article:","output":"Title: Roma Stumble in Serie A Title Race with Goalless Draw at Empoli Roma's hopes of catching up with Serie A leaders Juventus took a big hit after a disappointing goalless draw away against lowly Empoli on Saturday. This result leaves the Giallorossi four points behind the defending champions, and allowed the chasing pack to close in on the second place. Heading into the match, Roma were expected to secure a comfortable victory against the relegation-threatened Empoli. The home side had failed to register a point in their three previous fixtures, and currently sit in the relegation zone. However, the stubborn defensive display from Empoli proved to be enough to deny the title contenders as they were unable to break the deadlock throughout the 90 minutes. Roma came into the game in a rich vein of form, having won their previous four league encounters, including an emphatic 4-1 victory over Torino just a week earlier. Their attacking prowess was undermined by the suspension of in-form striker Edin Džeko, who picked up four yellow cards in the season and was ruled out for the match. In his absence, Roma struggled to create any clear-cut chances, with Empoli's defenders putting up a brave fight. From the outset, the visitors controlled possession and territory, but Empoli's resolute defending and well-organized formation presented a challenge for Roma's attacking players. The Giallorossi were unable to exploit any gaps in the home side's backline and much of the match played out in the midfield. Despite the pressure, Empoli's goalkeeper, Luigi Sepe, was rarely troubled throughout the game, with the best of Roma's chances coming in the 25th minute when Stephan El Shaarawy was denied in spectacular fashion. The Egyptian winger unleashed an ambitious long-range effort that seemed destined for the top corner, but Sepe flung himself across the goal to make a magnificent one-handed save. In the second half, Roma's manager, Paulo Fonseca, introduced his captain, club legend Daniele De Rossi, in a bid to inspire his team to victory. However, Empoli's commitment to solid defending remained unwavering, and the breakthrough continued to evade the visitors. As the game entered the final 10 minutes, the frustration began to show in the faces of Roma's players. Empoli cranked up their physicality, determined not to concede after surviving the majority of the contest without being breached. Although they had only managed a few shots on target at the other end, Empoli fans grew increasingly excited at the prospect of securing an unlikely point. The final whistle finally blew, and Empoli's heroic defensive display was rewarded with a point. For Roma, it was a case of two points dropped in the race for the Scudetto. While Juventus were held to a 2-2 draw away at Atalanta earlier in the day, which could have seen Roma make up some ground, they failed to capitalize. The result leaves Roma sitting on 65 points, four points behind Juventus, and just two points ahead of third-placed Napoli. With only six games remaining in the season, the Giallorossi will have to hope for a slip-up from the Old Lady to harbor any hopes of securing their first Serie A title since 2001. Empoli, on the other hand, have reason to be optimistic after their gritty performance against a top side. They will carry their fighting spirit into their remaining games, as they look to climb out of the relegation zone and secure their Serie A status for another season. In the end, it was an enthralling defensive display that drew headlines, with Roma's misfiring attack unable to make a decisive impact. The Serie A title race may not be over just yet, but the Giallorossi have to ensure that they capitalize on any future slip-ups from Juventus to remain in contention."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They often open very early and sometimes people wait in line all night to get good deals on things they want to buy. The day is called \\"Black\\" because in the past, when people kept their accounts on paper, a black ink meant profit for the stores. So, Black Friday is a day when stores make a lot of money because many people go shopping. A man named Earl Apfelbaum, who was a stamp dealer in Philadelphia, is often said to be the person who came up with the term \\"Black Friday\\" in the 1960s.

Please answer the following question: This week I shot my Interview with Claire Bridge. Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were. Overall the experience was also, I have a lot of friends who are artists so I hope to do more artist portraits in the future. Who conducted the interview - The author and Riah - Claire's favorite artist - Claire - not enough information Answer:","output":"The author of the passage conducted the interview with Claire Bridge alongside their colleague, Riah. They both traveled to Wheelers Hill, where Claire's studio is located. The interview went smoothly due to their well-planned questions and prior experience from helping with other interviews. It can be inferred that Claire enjoys living in Wheelers Hill due to its semi-suburban, peaceful atmosphere, abundant with nature, which complements her passion for the environment. The author and Riah had the opportunity to talk to Claire about the experience of being a woman in Melbourne's art scene and her favorite artists. However, the passage does not provide sufficient information to identify Claire's favorite artist(s).

Priscilla was nervous about the test but not the quiz because the","output":"test was a significant milestone in her academic journey, weighing heavily on her final grade. The quiz, on the other hand, was just a small portion of her overall evaluation, and she was confident about the material it would cover. The test was for her Advanced Calculus class, which she had been struggling with for the past few weeks. The time-consuming calculations, along with the complex theorems and structures, made it challenging for her to grasp the intricate concepts. Priscilla knew that the outcome of this test could potentially impact her chances of maintaining a desirable grade point average and, consequently, her scholarship. In contrast, the quiz was for her Creative Writing elective, a subject she excelled in and enjoyed immensely. Writing had always come naturally to her, and she found solace in expressing her thoughts and feelings through words. It was an activity that allowed her creativity to thrive and provided an escape from the highly analytical nature of her primary field of study. The night before the test, Priscilla found herself wide awake, her mind racing with thoughts about the upcoming evaluations. The looming challenge of the calculus test had consumed her, with reminders of theorems and formulae flitting through her mind like hyperactive butterflies. On the other hand, the quiz seemed like a distant and insignificant concern as she thought about her well-prepared responses to potential writing prompts. Determined to push through her anxiety, Priscilla devised a strategy to tackle the calculus test. She began by organizing a well-paced study plan that entailed reviewing previous lessons and completing practice questions. She made a conscious effort to clear her mind and focus on understanding each individual concept rather than becoming overwhelmed by the test as a whole. In addition, she sought help from her classmates and her professor, attending study groups and office hours to clarify any misconceptions she had. Priscilla realized that by addressing her weaknesses head-on, she could transform them into strengths. By the time the test arrived, Priscilla felt as prepared as she possibly could be, given her struggles with Advanced Calculus. She took a deep breath before entering the exam room, reminding herself that she had done everything within her power to prepare for this moment. And despite the uncertainty she felt, Priscilla took solace in the fact that she still had the creative writing quiz to look forward to, as a reprieve from the rigors of her mathematical coursework. After the test, Priscilla discovered that her diligent preparation had paid off; she had performed better than she initially anticipated. While not acing the test, she earned a respectable grade that allowed her to maintain her desired GPA. As expected, the creative writing quiz was a breeze for her, and she enjoyed crafting a beautifully written short story based on the provided prompt. Ultimately, Priscilla's experience brought forth an important lesson in perseverance and self-awareness. She realized the importance of facing her fears, challenging her inadequacies, and utilizing her strengths to overcome obstacles. This period of growth and self-discovery equipped her with valuable tools she would carry with her as she continued to navigate the turbulent waters of academia and life in general."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: [-] Place 2 eggs in a cup, add some salt and veggies, beat with a fork and cook it [-] Place 2 lemons in a cup, add some salt and veggies, beat with a fork and cook it","output":"The more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning for making an omelet is: Place 2 eggs in a cup, add some salt and veggies, beat with a fork and cook it. Here's a detailed and long answer on how to make an omelet using this method: Ingredients: - 2 large eggs - Salt, to taste - Black pepper, to taste - 1 tablespoon butter or oil - 1/4 cup chopped vegetables of your choice (onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, etc.) - Optional: 1/4 cup shredded cheese or crumbled feta cheese - Optional: Fresh herbs (parsley, chives, cilantro) Instructions: 1. Prepare the ingredients: Finely chop your chosen vegetables, grate or crumble the cheese if using, and chop the fresh herbs. 2. Crack the eggs: Crack the 2 eggs into a cup or a bowl. This allows you to ensure that there are no shells in your eggs. 3. Whisk the eggs: Add a pinch of salt and black pepper to taste, and beat the eggs with a fork until they are well-mixed and slightly frothy. This step is essential for creating a light and fluffy omelet. 4. Mix in the vegetables: Stir your chosen chopped vegetables into the egg mixture. If you're using cheese or fresh herbs, add them to the mixture as well. 5. Preheat the pan: Place a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of butter or oil and let it melt, ensuring it coats the bottom and sides of the pan evenly. This prevents the omelet from sticking to the pan. 6. Pour the egg mixture into the pan: Once the butter or oil is hot and slightly sizzling, pour the egg and vegetable mixture into the pan. Gently spread the mixture evenly in the pan using a spatula if needed. 7. Cook the omelet: Allow the eggs to cook undisturbed for a few minutes, until the bottom of the omelet is set and lightly golden brown. You can gently lift the edge of the omelet with a spatula to check for doneness. 8. Flip or fold the omelet: If you prefer, you can carefully flip the omelet over using a spatula to cook the other side for another minute or two. Alternatively, you can fold one side of the omelet over onto the other, creating a half-circle shape, and then cook for an additional minute to ensure the eggs are cooked through. 9. Serve the omelet: Use a spatula to gently slide the cooked omelet onto a plate. If desired, garnish with additional fresh herbs, salt, and pepper. Serve immediately. Using eggs in an omelet recipe is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because eggs serve as the primary ingredient that forms the omelet's structure upon cooking. Lemons, on the other hand, cannot replace eggs in an omelet recipe since they do not possess the same properties as eggs, such as coagulating upon heating, which is essential for forming an omelet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rothstein (born June 10, 1962) is a disbarred lawyer and the former managing shareholder, chairman, and chief executive officer of the now-defunct Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler law firm. He was accused of funding his philanthropy, political contributions, law firm salaries, and an extravagant lifestyle with a 1.2 billion Ponzi scheme, one of the largest such in history. On December 1, 2009, Rothstein turned himself in to authorities and was subsequently arrested on charges related to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Although his arraignment plea was not guilty, Rothstein cooperated with the Government and reversed his plea to guilty of five federal crimes on January 27, 2010. Debra Villegas, who handles his money, is the law firm's chief operating officer. She is co-owner with Rothstein in a home at 2307 Castilla Isle, as of May 2009. According to records, Rothstein originally purchased the property in September 2007, for 1.75 million, and sold it for 10 to a shell corporation in September 2009.  In 2005, the year the Ponzi scheme allegedly began, Villegas earned 80,000 a year. In 2007, her salary had increased to 145,000. Villegas received two Swiss watches -- a Rolex and a Breitling -- from her \\"employer\\". Rothstein paid off her couch and a bedroom set and held title to her two Honda water scooters. Villegas was living in a 475,000 Weston home that Rothstein signed over to her in July 2009 for 100 and \\"love and affection,\\" according to the deed. Villegas registered a 2009 100,000 Maserati GranTurismo at the home in January, 2009. In November 2009, Federal prosecutors seized the home, alleging that it was among Rothstein's ill-gotten assets.  Villegas' estranged husband, Tony Villegas, was charged on circumstantial evidence in the March 2008 murder in Plantation, Florida of Melissa Britt Lewis, a partner in Rothstein's firm. Although early news reports wondered at whether the evidence was substantial, according to New Times, \\"Nine days later, forensic testing revealed that Tony's DNA had been found on Melissa's suit jacket - the same jacket she wore on the day she died.\\"  Police sealed the arrest affidavit. As a result of the homicide and the nature of the legal business, Rothstein has a team of \\"executive protection specialists\\" to guard the firm and his family, his teen-aged daughter. The prosecutor who had first worked on the Villegas case, Howard Scheinberg, went to work for Rosenfeldt Rothstein Adler. Villegas, a train conductor, remains in jail awaiting trial. The motive was supposedly revenge for Lewis's closeness with Debra. Debra and Melissa share a therapist: Ilene Vinikoor, whose husband, David represents general counsel, David Boden in the Ponzi scheme investigation.  \\"You get anger from people...

It's like they help keep the city's big family happy and organized. Now, let's talk about the stages of evolution of public administration. This means how the \\"big team\\" and the way they work changed over time to become better. We can think of four main stages: 1. Traditional stage: This is like when the big team was very small and they did simple tasks, like just making sure people are following the rules. 2. Progressive stage: Here, the big team grew a bit bigger and started thinking about how to make things better for everyone, like making sure all children can go to school. 3. Modern stage: This is like now, where the big team is even bigger and smarter. They use computers and other tools to help make their jobs easier and to ensure that everything works well for people living in the city or country. 4.

This helps make sure that everyone can have a nice life, with good schools, safe roads, and other things that make people happy.

Police identified three children Robert McGregor, 36, raped from among child pornography that officers found during a search of his home in Inverness. The identified victims were boys aged three, six and 12. Police officers investigating the case described McGregor's actions as \\"abhorrent and unforgivable\\". The High Court in Edinburgh heard that he had groomed and exploited children for 13 years. Sentencing McGregor, judge Lady Carmichael said he had formed relationships with families in order to gain access to children, who he then subjected to abuse. She said that his youngest victim was \\"extremely vulnerable\\". The judge said that the material recovered in the case not only demonstrated what he had done but that he had persisted in it despite the obvious distress of victims. Lady Carmichael told McGregor that she would have jailed him for 15 years but for his early guilty pleas to the catalogue of offences. The judge also ordered that he be kept under supervision for a further five years on his release. Lady Carmichael said she was not satisfied that the risk criteria were met for imposing a life sentence on McGregor under an Order for Lifelong Restriction. One man in court called McGregor an \\"animal\\" as he was led off to start his sentence. The child abuser's home in Inverness, was raided by police in May last year and laptops and other items were seized for analysis. Advocate depute Jo McDonald, prosecuting, said a search warrant was granted to police after intelligence was received from the National Online Child Abuse Prevention Agency. More than 2,000 indecent photographs and 899 videos were recovered, many of which were found to contain materiel at the most extreme level of abuse. The prosecutor told the court: \\"Some of the images showed children who appeared to be as young as 12 months old.\\" Some of the videos were found to feature McGregor raping and sexually abusing three victims who were later identified by police. In one case, officers produced stills of a child from video footage and images were shown to a staff member at an Inverness school who identified the boy. They traced the ex-pupil and the man broke down when they asked if he had suffered abuse from McGregor, the court heard. McGregor had uploaded five videos to a peer to peer internet app which allowed others to view the footage of his abuse of one of his victims. Police computer experts found that the files had been accessed by users in America, Germany and in the Czech Republic. McGregor, a delivery driver, made an initial court appearance charged with possessing indecent images of children and was freed on bail but was then assaulted. Following further police investigations it became possible to identify one of his victims and he appeared again in court facing further charges, including child rape. Bail was then refused by a sheriff. McGregor subsequently pleaded guilty to six offences when he appeared at the High Court admitting three charges of raping three boys, sexually assaulting one youngster, making indecent photos of children and distributing or showing indecent photos. His sex assaults on children spanned more than a decade between 2001 and 2014 and all the attacks occurred in the Inverness area. His youngest identified victim was aged three. Another boy was subjected to nearly a decade of abuse from the age of six and the third child victim was 12 when McGregor assaulted him. The child pornography offences took place between 2011 and March last year. The advocate depute said that McGregor's offending had had a profound effect on some victims. She said that the scale and nature of his crimes has \\"scarred families for life\\". Defence solicitor advocate John Keenan said: \\"On any view this is an extremely serious catalogue of offences in a variety of different ways.\\" Mr Keenan said that it had to be acknowledged that McGregor's crimes had had \\"a significant impact\\" especially on his two older victims. He added that \\"mercifully\\" the youngest victim appeared to have no recollection of what happened. The defence lawyer said McGregor seemed willing to take part in programmes to address his behaviour and it was considered that if that happened it would lessen the risk he posed. McGregor was told he would be on the sex offenders register indefinitely. Following the sentencing, Det Insp Mark Lambley, of the National Child Abuse Investigation Unit, described McGregor's actions as \\"abhorrent and unforgivable\\". He said: \\"Firstly I want to acknowledge the courage shown by the victims and their families by coming forward and then throughout this investigation, which resulted in the conviction and today's sentencing of Robert McGregor. \\"Officers will continue to support the families, working alongside local partner agencies and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.\\" The officer added: \\"Robert McGregor preyed on young children and abused the trust of the families involved through his abhorrent and unforgivable offending. \\"A case this harrowing is rarely seen in Scotland and will understandably send shockwaves through our local communities. \\"It is hoped, however, that today's sentencing sends out a clear message that Police Scotland will robustly and sensitively investigate all reports of sexual abuse - regardless of when the abuse took place - helping to ensure we keep everyone safe.\\" Andy Shanks, Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service Procurator Fiscal for Sexual Offences, said McGregor's offending had a \\"devastating impact on his victims and their families\\". What was that article about?","output":"The article is about the sentencing of Robert McGregor, a 36-year-old man who was convicted of sexually abusing and raping three young boys, aged three, six, and 12, in Inverness. McGregor engaged in these activities for thirteen years, forming relationships with families to gain access to children. Over 2,000 indecent photographs and 899 videos were found on his devices, and he had distributed some of the materials online. McGregor was sentenced to 15 years in prison, to be followed by five years of supervision upon release, and will be on the sex offenders register indefinitely.

After sleeping with Vicki, Walter tells her that he molested little girls, but rationalizes his crimes by saying \\"I didn't hurt them.\\" Vicki is clearly shocked and disturbed by this new information, but before she can consider how to respond to it, Walter tells her to leave his apartment. Walter receives frequent visits from a suspicious, verbally abusive police officer named Lucas (Mos Def). Lucas makes it clear that he is waiting to catch Walter reoffending. Watching the school, Walter sees a man offering candy to little boys in an apparent effort to gain their confidence. He realizes that this man, whom he nicknames \\"Candy\\" (Kevin Rice), is another child molester. Walter also meets an apparently lonely young girl named Robin (Hannah Pilkes) who is a bird watcher. Walter sees Candy abduct a boy; however, he does not report this to the police. Walter's life takes a further downturn when a suspicious co-worker, Mary-Kay (Eve), learns of his conviction and alerts the entire mill. Some of the employees attack Walter, but Vicki and the boss of the mill come to his defense. Ostracized and frustrated, Walter leaves his workplace and goes to the park. Vicki, fearing the worst, begins to search for him. Walter ends up meeting with Robin at the park. As they talk, he begins to succumb to his desires and invites Robin to sit on his lap. She politely refuses, but then begins to confide in him. As she begins to cry, Walter realizes that she is being molested by her father. In her anguish, and sensing a similarity between her father and Walter, she offers to sit on Walter's lap, wanting his...","output":"Insufficient information to provide an answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Text: In recent years a lower level resolution of offences has often been used by police forces in England and Wales instead of a caution. This is usually called a 'community resolution' and invariably requires less police time as offenders are not arrested. A community resolution does not require any formal record but the offender should admit the offence and the victim should be happy with this method of informal resolution. Concerns have been expressed over the use of community resolution for violent offences, in particular 'domestic violence'. Question: can you be given a police caution without being arrested?

Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

Answer with text (not indexes). Context: A historian is a person who researches, studies, and writes about the past, and is regarded as an authority on it. Historians are concerned with the continuous, methodical narrative and research of past events as relating to the human race; as well as the study of all history in time. If the individual is concerned with events preceding written history, the individual is a historian of prehistory. Although \\"historian\\" can be used to describe amateur and professional historians alike, it is reserved more recently for those who have acquired graduate degrees in the discipline. Some historians, though, are recognized by publications or training and experience. \\"Historian\\" became a professional occupation in the late nineteenth century as research universities were emerging in Germany and elsewhere., The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula which forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian., Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla., Prehistory means literally \\"before history\\", from the Latin word for \\"before,\\" ', and Greek '. Human prehistory is the period from the time that behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appear until the appearance of recorded history following the invention of writing systems. Since both the time of settlement of modern humans and the evolution of human civilisations differ from region to region, prehistory starts and ends at different moments in time, depending on the region concerned., Septimania (  ) was the western region of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis that passed under the control of the Visigoths in 462, when Septimania was ceded to their king, Theodoric II. Under the Visigoths it was known as simply Gallia or Narbonensis. It corresponded roughly with the modern French region of Languedoc-Roussillon. It passed briefly to the Emirate of Córdoba in the eighth century before its conquest by the Franks, who by the end of the ninth century termed it Gothia or the Gothic March (\\"Marca Gothica\\")., Al-Andalus (trans.   Berber: \\"Andalus\\"), also known as Muslim Spain or Islamic Iberia, was a medieval Muslim territory and cultural domain occupying at its peak most of what are today Spain and Portugal. At its greatest geographical extent in the eighth century, southern FranceSeptimaniawas briefly under its control. The name more generally describes parts of the Iberian Peninsula governed by Muslims (given the generic name of Moors) at various times between 711 and 1492, though the boundaries changed constantly as the Christian Reconquista progressed., A Muslim is someone who follows or practises Islam, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion. Muslims consider the Quran (Koran), their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. They also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (\\"sunnah \\") as recorded in traditional accounts (\\"hadith\\"). \\"Muslim\\" is an Arabic word meaning \\"one who submits (to God)\\"., The (Spanish and Portuguese for the \\"reconquest\\") is the period of history of the Iberian Peninsula spanning approximately 770 years between the Islamic conquest of Hispania in 710 and the fall of the last Islamic state in Iberia at Granada to the expanding Christian kingdoms in 1492. The \\" ended just before the European discovery of the Americasthe \\"New World\\"which ushered in the era of the Portuguese and Spanish colonial empires., History (from Greek , \\"historia\\", meaning \\"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\\") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians., Portugal (Portuguese: ), officially the Portuguese Republic (Portuguese: ), is a country on the Iberian Peninsula in Southwestern Europe. It is the westernmost country of mainland Europe. To the west and south it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and to the east and north by Spain.

The republic also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, both autonomous regions with their own regional governments., Ab Marwn ayyn ibn Khalaf ibn usayn ibn ayyn al - Qurub ( 987 -- 1075 ) , usually known as Ibn Hayyan , was a Muslim historian from Al - Andalus . Born at Córdoba , he was an important official at the court of the Andalusian ruler al - Mansur and published several works on history which have only survived in part . His books constitute one of the most important sources for the study of the Andalusian history , especially the history of Córdoba and the kings of the taifas .

Given the question: In September, a new and widely advertised school opened its doors in the capital city - the Part-time Evening Elementary School. You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.

In photography, shutter speed or exposure time is the length of time when the film or digital sensor inside the camera is exposed to light, also when a camera's shutter is open when taking a photograph. The amount of light that reaches the film or image sensor is proportional to the exposure time. ​⁄ of a second will let half as much light in as ​⁄. Is the following statement correct based on the text are exposure and shutter speed the same thing","output":"Yes, according to the given text, exposure and shutter speed refer to the same concept in the context of photography. However, it's essential to understand their relationship and how they are interconnected with other elements of photography, such as aperture and ISO. Shutter speed, also known as exposure time, is the length of time the camera's shutter remains open to allow light to reach the film or digital sensor when capturing an image. The shutter speed can vary from fractions of a second to minutes and even hours in certain cases. Shutter speeds are typically represented in seconds or fractions of a second (e.g., 1/60, 1/125, 1/250, etc.). A fast shutter speed (e.g., 1/1000) is used to freeze motion and is ideal for capturing action shots, while a slow shutter speed (e.g., 1\\") can create an intentional blur in the image for creative purposes. Exposure is the term used to describe the overall amount of light that reaches the camera's sensor or film. It is influenced by three main factors — shutter speed, aperture, and ISO — collectively known as the \\"exposure triangle.\\" Adjusting any of these three factors will affect the overall exposure, thus impacting the final photograph. Aperture refers to the size of the lens opening, which controls the amount of light that enters the camera. Aperture is expressed in f-numbers (e.g., f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, etc.), and a lower f-number indicates a larger lens opening and more light entering the camera, whereas a higher f-number indicates a smaller lens opening and less light. ISO is a measurement of the sensor's sensitivity to light. A lower ISO (e.g., 100 or 200) means the sensor is less sensitive to light and produces a cleaner image. In contrast, a higher ISO (e.g., 1600 or 3200) makes the sensor more sensitive to light, allowing you to capture images in low light situations; however, this can result in a noisier or grainier image. In summary, while exposure and shutter speed are often used interchangeably in the context provided, it is important to understand that they are part of a larger system that includes aperture and ISO, which all work together to control the amount of light that reaches the sensor or film and determines the overall exposure and final outcome of the photograph. Understanding the relationship between these factors will help you better control the outcome of your photos and achieve the desired creative effects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

Self-consciousness and body image issues: The person indicates that they are fearful of wearing a bathing suit in front of other people, which suggests that they might be struggling with self-consciousness and body image issues. This can be a significant hurdle for many people who feel insecure about their physical appearance. The idea of being seen in swimwear by others can evoke intense anxiety and discomfort. 2. Exposed surgical incisions (Choice B): If the person has recently undergone surgery, they may be worried about exposing their surgical incisions to the water and other people's eyes. The potential health risks associated with swimming soon after surgery include infection, the healing process being disrupted, and exacerbating any existing pain or swelling. Additionally, they might also be self-conscious about the appearance of their healing wounds. 3. Medical advice against swimming (Choice A): Another concern could be that their doctor has advised them to avoid swimming in the near term. Sometimes, doctors might recommend avoiding certain activities like swimming in a pool while recovering from various medical procedures. This is to ensure proper healing and prevent complications. 4. Discomfort with social situations (Choice C): The person might also be concerned about going to the pool if they generally don't like going outside or being in social situations. Social anxiety or agoraphobia can cause people to feel nervous and fearful about venturing into public spaces or interacting with others. In this case, the swimming pool may represent a stressful setting that exacerbates these feelings. 5. Physical ability to swim after surgery: If the person has recently had surgery, they may be worried about their ability to participate in pool activities while recovering. Depending on the nature of the surgery and the specific advice from their healthcare provider, they might need to avoid strenuous exercise or certain movements until they have sufficiently healed. In conclusion, though exposed surgical incisions (Choice B) seem to be one of the concerns, it is important to acknowledge that this person might be dealing with a combination of self-consciousness, medical restrictions, and possible mental health issues influencing their hesitation toward going to the pool. Each of these factors should be considered when addressing and supporting their concerns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. We went to Long Animal Hospital for a couple of years and had to stop going over a series of really bad encounters and mishaps.   They are a well-established clinic in a good location; however, it is a bit run-down and you'll definitely see rusting, paint chipping and questionable cleanliness if you go often enough. We haven't been there in a few years, however, Dr. Killough, Sr stands out as a vet we would never go to again after the very rough handling we experienced with our older, very sweet and gentle, greyhound. He treated her like she was a truck on an assembly line and after that visit alone, she started getting panic attacks everytime we would go thereafter (it was her first time seeing Dr. Killough, Sr after going to the practice for over 3 years).   Second, they \\"forgot\\" to give her a Bordatella vaccination (for over 3 years) even though we saw them regularly, we had her original paperwork/vaccination schedule sent when we first got her and they did her vaccinations each year. We were going on a weekend trip and keeping her at a boarding facility, had their vaccinations sent over and the facility promptly called us to tell us she didn't have her Bordatella - kind of important.  Third, they prescribed incorrect dosages to our 2nd greyhound who had heart issues. In fact, they diagnosed him with all his heart issues and kept putting him on different meds - each time we would go in, their diagnosis would change (his heart murmur went from a grade 2 to a grade 6, then to a 5) - he had high blood pressure, then he didn't, then he did again. He had an enlarged heart, then it was normal (ex-racers are naturally larger) and then it was again. Get the picture? We took him to NCSU vet school and they said it was around a grade 4 and that his medication strengths were all off. They sent all the results and paperwork back to Long's. I am guessing they didn't read it, because our next visit to Long's, they re-upped his medications (he was on 3 different medications). He started having kidney issues (and what dog wouldn't on all those meds?) and the prescription bottle dosage changed *again* -- I called them and they had no idea what dosage he was on, or what he should be on or why this bottle was different than the last. I asked them to review what NCSU sent over, which they did, and I had to go back, again, to get his \\"true\\" medications and dosages. What a mess. We later took him to a canine cardiologist in Charlotte (she had just started practicing here) and she was appalled at all the changes in his diagnoses, medications and dosages. His health definitely suffered as a result of inadequate care and he died, of heart failure, when he was barely 8 years old. Long's just wasn't capable of treating his condition.  By the time we were forced to leave, both our dogs were having panic attacks when going there (something they didn't have at first, and didn't have at the next vet clinic we went to). We didn't have a regular vet, we saw all of them there and perhaps that is why they never seemed to know what the heck had gone on with our dogs before that visit (we ended up having to tell them our dogs' histories, which sucks, since THEY had their records). Maybe they were too busy to read charts, maybe we got them on bad days, I don't know - but I believe a vet should at least skim an animal's record before walking in and seeing them again. Why should I have to tell you what meds my dog is on? Why should I have to tell them what they diagnosed last time?   Finally, we never used them for boarding, but the boarding conditions are insanely bad. They are outdoor cages attached to the main clinic building. Dogs were completely exposed to the elements AND to anyone walking to the backside of the clinic. Perhaps they've upgraded in the last couple years, but even if they have, I find it pretty bothersome that dogs would sit in a cage in winter, the dead of summer, through rainstorms and potentially have some random person do something to them because they are in outdoor cages. I could never understand how anyone could leave their dog in those conditions.  We didn't try them one time, have one bad experience, and leave - we went there for over three years and it was one headache after another. I will say that the front office staff were all incredibly nice. They knew our dogs by name within a visit or two and were very welcoming when we came. We also had some good experiences with the vets there, which is why we went there for so long -- but the bad experiences, in the end, outweighed the good and we left. We aren't looking for anything fancy-schmancy (as another reviewer mentioned) - but we expect them to know what's going on with our dogs, diagnose them correctly, give them correct meds with correct doses, have a clean practice and humane boarding conditions -- oh, and maybe be gentle with the animals when necessary.

Using accounting software offers numerous benefits as compared to relying on a service. In today's fast-paced business environment, leveraging technology to manage your finances helps save time, reduce errors, and make financial management more efficient. Here's a closer look at the reasons why accounting software is not only easy to use, but also advantageous for businesses. 1. Easy to learn and understand: Accounting software is designed to make the process of managing finances easier, even for users with minimal accounting knowledge. Most programs come with step-by-step tutorials, online help, or in-software guidance, making it simple for users to become proficient within a short time. 2. User-friendly interface: Modern accounting software features a user-friendly interface that streamlines navigation and allows for easy data entry. Intuitive layouts and clear visual displays make it simple for users to input financial transactions, generate reports, and analyze data with ease. 3. Automation: One of the biggest advantages of using accounting software is its ability to automate repetitive tasks, such as data entry, calculations, and report generation. This automation not only saves time but also reduces the risk of human error, ensuring accuracy and reliability in your financial management. 4. Integration with other tools: Accounting software often integrates seamlessly with other business tools and systems, such as payroll, invoicing, or inventory management. This compatibility streamlines processes and eliminates the need for manual data transfers, further simplifying financial management. 5. Real-time financial data: With cloud-based accounting software, businesses can access their financial data in real-time, from anywhere, at any time. This allows for more informed decision-making, a better understanding of your company's financial health, and quick access to crucial information when needed. 6. Customization: Many accounting software programs offer customization options, enabling users to tailor the software to their specific needs. This lets businesses create templates and reports that fit their unique processes, ensuring the software remains relevant and useful as the company changes and evolves. 7. Cost-effective: Accounting software is often less expensive than outsourcing your financial management to a service. This cost savings allows businesses to allocate resources to other essential areas, such as marketing, product development, or staff training. In conclusion, accounting software is not only easy to use but also offers a host of benefits that can save time, reduce errors, streamline processes, and improve decision-making for businesses. By opting for software over a service, companies can enjoy a greater level of control over their financial management while still ensuring accuracy and efficiency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process:  - The nuclei of some atoms have too few or too many neutrons - The atoms become unstable - The atoms split - In alpha decay, two protons and two neutrons are released from the atom - In beta decay, a neutron changes into a proton and an electron - The proton joins the nucleus of the atom - The electron is released -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are less nuclei of some atoms happens, how will it affect less atoms split.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of atomic decay. If there are fewer unstable atomic nuclei, this will directly result in fewer atoms splitting due to the decreased number of unstable atoms available. Additionally, it can also indirectly affect the process through secondary effects in the surrounding environment, as well as the overall behavior of the atomic system being considered. Let's explore these direct and indirect effects in more detail. Direct Effects: 1. Lower Decay Rate: When the number of unstable atomic nuclei decreases, the overall decay rate of the system will be reduced. This is because there will be fewer unstable nuclei present that are prone to undergo alpha or beta decay. 2. Less Radioactive Material: With fewer unstable atomic nuclei, the amount of radioactive material in the system will decrease. Consequently, the overall energy released due to the decay process, as well as any potential harm caused by the radioactive material, will be reduced. Indirect Effects: 1. Alteration of Decay Chains: In certain situations, the decay of one atom generates a product that is also unstable and undergoes further decay. This process is referred to as a decay chain. A reduction in the number of unstable nuclei would result in fewer decay chains and potentially alter the balance of isotopes in the system. 2. Changes in Nuclear Reactions: Nuclear reactions, such as those occurring in a nuclear power plant or a star, depend on the presence of certain atomic nuclei. If the number of unstable nuclei in a system is altered, it may affect the rate or nature of nuclear reactions taking place. 3. Impacts on Particle Interactions: Particles released during alpha or beta decay, such as alpha particles, positrons, or electrons, can interact with atoms in the surrounding environment, resulting in further decay processes or the creation of new radioactive isotopes. A decrease in the number of unstable nuclei can lead to fewer particle interactions, potentially altering the overall behavior of the atomic system. 4. Effects on Radiation Levels and Detection: The reduction of unstable nuclei will also result in lower levels of radiation emitted by the system. This can have implications for radiation detection and monitoring, as well as any potential impact on living organisms in the vicinity of the system. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of having fewer unstable atomic nuclei can directly affect the process by reducing the number of atoms that split through alpha and beta decay. Furthermore, indirect effects include alterations in decay chains, changes in nuclear reactions, impacts on particle interactions, and effects on radiation levels and detection. Overall, the perturbation hypothesis can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process of atomic decay."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Getting ready to go on to stage, Robert was sweating whereas William was whistling because","output":"Getting ready to go on stage, Robert was sweating profusely from a combination of nerves, anxiety, and the bright, hot stage lights directly on him; the anticipation of performing in front of a large audience, where expectations were high, had his heart rate accelerating faster with each passing second, and his hands shaking uncontrollably with involuntary jitters. The blend of countless hours of preparation, sleepless nights, and the unwavering desire to deliver an exceptional performance weighed heavily on Robert's demeanor, making him prone to stress-induced perspiration. On the other hand, William was whistling a carefree, jaunty tune while he waited for his turn to step into the spotlight, because, unlike his anxious counterpart, William had an uncanny ability to remain composed under pressure, embracing the thrill of performing and basking in the excitement of the moment. Having performed on numerous stages throughout his life, perhaps owing to his early introduction to the arts by his nurturing and supportive family, William possessed an innate confidence that enveloped him with an air of serenity, enabling him to effortlessly maintain his equanimity amidst the nerve-wracking moments leading up to a pivotal performance. Moreover, William had cultivated an unwavering trust in his preparation, knowing that he had done everything possible to hone his skills, making him capable of handling any unforeseen challenges or obstacles that might arise during the show. His meticulously rehearsed routines, coupled with his natural aptitude for improvisation when needed, served to fortify his self-assurance, enabling him to whistle nonchalantly as he eagerly awaited the curtains to rise. Indeed, this striking contrast between Robert's nervous, sweat-drenched demeanor and William's calm, whistling presence painted a vivid image of two individuals with vastly different experiences and emotional responses when faced with the pressure of performing in front of an eager and expectant audience.

Article:","output":"Title: The Art of Success: Persistence, Patience, and Keeping Your Fans in the Loop Introduction We live in an incredibly competitive world, powered by advances in technology and the ever-growing impact of social media. As we strive to make a name for ourselves, it's easy to get caught up in the whirlwind and lose sight of the essential ingredients that drive success and personal fulfillment. In this article, we will unravel the powerful trio - persistence, patience, and keeping your fans in the loop - that every aspiring individual should embrace to achieve their goals. The Power of Persistence The road to success is often filled with obstacles, but the relentless pursuit of goals can help us push through and emerge victorious. Thomas Edison famously said, \\"Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.\\" Indeed, persistence is the key ingredient that separates successful individuals from quitters. To cultivate persistence, experts recommend setting realistic goals, breaking them down into smaller tasks, and celebrating progress along the way. By focusing on achieving one small task at a time, we develop the mental resilience needed to tackle more significant challenges. Moreover, overcoming setbacks and learning from them fosters a growth mindset that ultimately leads to success. The Virtue of Patience In a world where instant gratification is the norm, patience has become a scarce commodity. We often compare ourselves to others who seem to have achieved success overnight and feel impatient with our own progress. However, lasting success rarely happens overnight. It takes years of hard work, dedication, and patience. The stories of some of the most successful people highlight the importance of patience. J.K. Rowling, for example, faced multiple rejections before Harry Potter became a worldwide phenomenon. Likewise, Colonel Sanders of KFC fame achieved most of his success later in life, proving that it's never too late to make your mark. To develop patience, it's crucial to maintain a long-term perspective and manage expectations. Surrounding yourself with supportive people who believe in your potential is an effective way to keep your spirits up, even when things don't seem to be going according to plan. Keeping Your Fans in the Loop Whether you're an entrepreneur, an artist, or a content creator, the support of your fans and followers plays a crucial role in your success. As you work tirelessly towards your goals, it's important not to forget those who believe in your vision and are eager to see you succeed. Keeping your fans informed about your progress and achievements not only maintains their interest but also serves as a reminder of why they chose to invest their time and energy in your journey. Actively engaging with your audience – be it through social media, newsletters, or personal interactions – establishes trust and loyalty. Being transparent about the highs and lows of your journey also fosters a sense of authenticity and relatability, which further strengthens the bond between you and your fanbase. Conclusion In conclusion, the art of success lies in a harmonious blend of persistence, patience, and keeping your fans in the loop. Embracing these principles fosters a winning mindset and an unbreakable support network, both of which will pave the way to a fulfilling and rewarding journey. So, tell all your friends and family, and be prepared to weather the storms with persistence and patience. Remember, every successful story comes with its fair share of setbacks, but it's how you handle them and move forward that truly sets you apart from the rest."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Man stabs 29 children, 3 adults at kindergarten in China in 2nd attack this week TAIXING, China (AP) — The screams of the children inside the kindergarten could be heard out in the street. When people ran in to investigate, they found what one witness said was a scene \\"too horrible to imagine\\" — blood everywhere as a knife-wielding man slashed 29 children, two teachers and a security guard Thursday in the second such school attack in China in two days. Experts called it a copycat rampage triggered by similar incidents Wednesday and last month. They said the wave of school attacks falls amid poor care for the mentally unstable and growing feelings of social injustice in the fast-changing country. All the students were aged 4 or 5 years old. Thursday's attack at the Zhongxin Kindergarten left five students badly injured, two of them in critical condition, in the eastern city of Taixing, said Zhu Guiming, an official with the municipal propaganda department. Two teachers and the security guard were also hurt. Initially officials had reported that 28 children had been hurt but they later realized they had miscounted. The official Xinhua News Agency identified the attacker as Xu Yuyuan, a 47-year-old unemployed man. He pushed his way into the classroom with an eight-inch (20-centimeter) knife after two teachers and a security guard failed to stop him. No motive was given. Xu had been a salesman in a local insurance company until he was fired in 2001. Since then, he has remained jobless, Xinhua said. A witness to the early morning attack said people outside heard screams coming from the three-story building and rushed inside. \\"It was too horrible to imagine. I saw blood everywhere, and kids bleeding from their heads,\\" a visibly shaken Hu Tao told The Associated Press hours later. \\"Some of them could not open their eyes because of the blood,\\" he said. Hu, who owns a small restaurant across the street from the school, said a delivery man used a fire extinguisher to knock Xu down. Set in a side street off the main avenue of the heavily industrialized city, the kindergarten has a whimsical European-style castle turret rising above its gate and a cartoon-like bunny by the entrance, which was sealed off by police tape. Most of the recent school invasions have been blamed on people with personal grudges or suffering from mental illness, leading to calls for improved security. Accounts in China's state-owned media have glossed over motives and largely shied away from why schools have so often been targets. Yet experts say outbursts against the defenseless are frequently due to social pressures. An avowedly egalitarian society only a generation ago, China's headlong rush to prosperity has sharpened differences between haves and have-nots, and the public health system has atrophied even as pressures grew. China likely has about 173 million adults with mental health disorders, and 158 million of them have never had professional help, according to a mental health survey in four provinces jointly done by Chinese and U.S. doctors that was published in the medical journal The Lancet in June. \\"We must create a more healthy and just society,\\" said Zhou Xiaozheng, a sociology professor at Renmin University in Beijing. While it's not known if Thursday's attacker knew about previous school stabbings, Zhou said such sensational, violent acts often draw copycats. \\"Normally, with these kind of violent events we hope the media won't blow them up too much, because that tends to make it spread,\\" Zhou said. On Wednesday, a man in the southern city of Leizhou broke into a primary school and wounded 15 students and a teacher in a knife attack. The suspect, Chen Kangbing, 33, was a former teacher who had been on sick leave since 2006 for mental health problems. That attack came the same day a man was executed for stabbing eight children to death outside their elementary school last month in the southeastern city of Nanping. The attack in March shocked China because eight children died and the assailant had no known history of mental illness. At his trial, Zheng Minsheng, 42, said he killed because he had been upset after being jilted by a woman and treated badly by her wealthy family. He was executed Wednesday, just a little over a month after his crime. A fourth attack earlier this month occurred when a mentally ill man hacked to death a second grader and an elderly woman with a meat cleaver near a school in southern Guangxi, and wounded five other people, including students. After a 2004 attack at a school in Beijing that left nine students dead, the central government ordered tighter school security nationwide. Regulations that took effect in 2006 require schools to register or inspect visitors and keep out people who have no reason to come inside. The man in Wednesday's attack managed to slip into the school with a group of visiting teachers, Xinhua reported. Chen Kangbing had been a teacher himself. Xinhua said he suffered from mental illness and had been on sick leave since February 2006. The attack left fourth and fifth graders with stab wounds on their heads, backs and arms, but none was in life-threatening condition. The Ministry of Education did not immediately respond to a fax Thursday asking whether this week's attacks would lead to changes in school security. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a knife-wielding man who attacked and slashed 29 children, two teachers, and a security guard at a kindergarten in Taixing, China.

For example, the word \\"d’intendance\\" uses an apostrophe, and words like \\"éthique\\" and \\"rétablissement\\" have acute accent marks, which is a characteristic of the French language. 4. French prepositions: The use of French prepositions such as \\"du\\", \\"de\\" and \\"au\\" in the text indicates a French context.  Therefore, considering these aspects, it is justified to infer that the text provided is in French."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

By 1208, the Germans were strong enough to begin operations against the Estonians, who were at that time divided into eight major and several smaller counties led by elders with limited co-operation between them. In 1208-27, war parties of the different sides rampaged through the Livonian, Northern Latgallian, and Estonian counties, with Livonians and Latgallians normally as allies of the Crusaders, and the Principalities of Polotsk and Pskov appearing as allies of different sides at different times. Hill forts, which were the key centres of Estonian counties, were besieged and captured a number of times. A truce between the war-weary sides was established for three years  and proved generally more favourable to the Germans, who consolidated their political position, while the Estonians were unable to develop their system of loose alliances into a centralised state. The Livonian leader Kaupo was killed in battle near Viljandi  on 21 September 1217, but the battle was a crushing defeat for the Estonians, whose leader Lembitu was also killed. Since 1211, his name had come to the attention of the German chroniclers as a notable Estonian elder, and he had become the central figure of the Estonian resistance. The Christian kingdoms of Denmark and Sweden were also greedy for conquests on the Eastern shores of the Baltic. While the Swedes made only one failed foray into western Estonia in 1220, the Danish Fleet headed by King Valdemar II of Denmark had landed at the Estonian town of Lindanisse  in 1219. After the Battle of Lyndanisse the Danes established a fortress, which was besieged by Estonians in 1220 and 1223, but held out. Eventually, the whole of northern Estonia came under Danish control.

I have been looking for a pattern such as this for some time and was really considering buying one or two sets until I read the reviews. Yikes..how does anyone arrive at a decision based on these reviews...they are all over the place! Since most of these reviews have been done over the period 2008-2011, it would be helpful if anyone who has purchased this set recently could give an updated review. There also seems to be some confusion as to where they are manufactured--USA or overseas. As I have discovered, the quality diminishes with most products manufactured overseas so I definitely don't want to waste my money. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the purpose of the review The user has submitted a review that's more focused on asking for information rather than providing their own opinion. Step 2: Determine the sentiment The reviewer expresses confusion and concern about the quality of the product due to mixed reviews and the possibility of overseas manufacturing. They haven't purchased the product yet and therefore do not provide any personal experience or direct comments about the product's quality. Step 3: Analyze the tone The tone of the review is neutral, with a hint of seeking assurance. The user is looking for recent and updated information before making their decision. Step 4: Reach a conclusion Based on the steps above, the product review primarily conveys a neutral sentiment, as the reviewer is neither praising nor criticizing the actual product. However, there is a slight negative undertone due to the concerns expressed about the quality and manufacturing location."},{"instruction":"Information:  - JURIST is an online legal news service hosted by the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, powered by a staff of more than 60 law students working in Pittsburgh and other US locations under the direction of founding Publisher & Editor-in-Chief Professor Bernard Hibbitts, Acting Executive Director Andrew Morgan, Research Director Jaclyn Belczyk, Technical Director Jeremiah Lee, Managing Editor Joseph Macklin and Chief of Staff Steven Wildberger.

He was an immensely influential philosopher, theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism, within which he is also known as the Doctor Angelicus and the Doctor Communis. The name \\"Aquinas\\" identifies his ancestral origins in the county of Aquino in present-day Lazio.  - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).  - Scholasticism is a method of critical thought which dominated teaching by the academics (\\"scholastics,\\" or \\"schoolmen\\") of medieval universities in Europe from about 1100 to 1700, and a program of employing that method in articulating and defending dogma in an increasingly pluralistic context. It originated as an outgrowth of and a departure from Christian monastic schools at the earliest European universities. The first institutions in the West to be considered universities were established in Italy, France, Spain, and England in the late 11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology, such as Schola Medica Salernitana, the University of Bologna, and the University of Paris. It is difficult to define the date at which they became true universities, although the lists of studia generalia for higher education in Europe are a useful guide, held by the Catholic Church and its various religious orders.  - Adam Pulchrae Mulieris , also called Adam de Puteorumvilla , was a Paris master who studied under Peter of Lamballe , who flourished in the first half of the 13th century . Little is known of his life . He has been described as one of the \`\` metaphysicians of light '' ( Robert Grosseteste was another ) . He was a contemporary of William of Auvergne , Bishop of Paris , and his works are cited by Richard de Fournival , Gerard of Abbeville and Thomas Aquinas . The origin of his name is unknown . The only book seriously attributed to him is Memoriale Rerum Difficilium , also known as De Intelligentiis . This was originally attributed to Witelo . It was published as Adam 's in 1908 but in the 1930s the question of this attribution was re-opened .  - Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies.  - Canonization is the act by which the Catholic Church and Anglican Communion declare that a person who has died was a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the canon, or list, of recognized saints. Originally, people were recognized as saints without any formal process. Later, different processes, such as those used today in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church, were developed.  - Robert Grosseteste (   9 October 1253) was an English statesman, scholastic philosopher, theologian, scientist and Bishop of Lincoln. He was born of humble parents at Stradbroke in Suffolk. Upon his death, he was almost universally revered as a saint in England, but attempts to procure a formal canonization failed. A. C. Crombie calls him \\"the real founder of the tradition of scientific thought in medieval Oxford, and in some ways, of the modern English intellectual tradition\\".  - Mendicant orders refers primarily to certain Christian religious orders that have adopted a lifestyle of poverty, travelling, and living in urban areas for purposes of preaching, evangelization, and ministry, especially to the poor. At their foundation these orders rejected the previously established monastic model of living in one stable, isolated community where members worked at a trade and owned property in common, including land, buildings and other wealth. By contrast, the mendicants avoided owning property, did not work at a trade, and embraced a poor, often itinerant lifestyle. They depended for their survival on the goodwill of the people to whom they preached.  - Gerard of Abbeville (1220-1272) was a theologian from the University of Paris. He formally became a theologian in 1257 and from then was known as an opponent of the mendicant orders, particularly in the second stage of the conflict, taking part in a concerted attack that temporarily affected their privileges.  - The Bishop of Lincoln is the ordinary of the Church of England Diocese of Lincoln in the Province of Canterbury.  - The University of Paris, metonymically known as the Sorbonne (its historical house), was a university in Paris, France. Appearing around 1150 as a corporation associated with the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral school, it was the second-oldest modern university in Europe. Chartered in 1200 by King Philip II (Philippe-Auguste) of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was often nicknamed after its theology collegiate institution, College of Sorbonne, founded about 1257 by Robert de Sorbon.  - Doctor of the Church (Latin \\"doctor\\" \\"teacher\\") is a title given by the Catholic Church to saints whom they recognize as having been of particular importance, particularly regarding their contribution to theology or doctrine.  - Richard de Fournival or Richart de Fornival (1201  ?1260) was a medieval philosopher and trouvère perhaps best known for the \\"Bestiaire d'amour\\" (\\"The Bestiary of Love\\").  - Oxford is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire. With a population of 159,994 it is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom, and one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse. The city is situated from London, from Bristol, from both Southampton and Birmingham and from Reading.  - A friar is a member of one of the mendicant orders founded since the twelfth or thirteenth century; the term distinguishes the mendicants' itinerant apostolic character, exercised broadly under the jurisdiction of a superior general, from the older monastic orders' allegiance to a single monastery formalized by their vow of stability. The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites.

Answer with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. <sep>Who had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships?<sep>Tun Perak Output:","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: (i) no. (ii) yes.","output":"(ii) yes. Hair fall is a common concern affecting both men and women and can be attributed to several factors. The reasons for hair fall can be broadly classified into internal and external causes. Here is a detailed explanation of these factors: 1. Genetic predisposition: A strong family history of hair loss can make you more susceptible to hair fall. Genetics can play a significant role in determining the pattern and progression of hair loss, male and female pattern baldness being prime examples. 2. Hormonal imbalances: Hormones are essential regulatory substances that control various body functions, including hair growth. Abnormal levels of hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone can cause hair fall. Hormonal fluctuations related to pregnancy and menopause also contribute to hair loss in women. 3. Nutritional deficiencies: A well-balanced diet is crucial for maintaining healthy hair. Malnutrition and deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals such as iron, biotin, vitamin D, and zinc can lead to hair fall. Inadequate protein intake can also weaken hair follicles and contribute to hair loss. 4. Stress: Physical and emotional stress can have a significant impact on hair health. The body's response to stress leads to hormonal changes that can cause hair to enter a resting phase, resulting in increased hair fall. Chronic stress can even lead to long-term hair loss. 5. Medical conditions and medications: Certain medical conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders, and autoimmune diseases like alopecia areata can cause hair fall. Furthermore, treatments for cancer, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can lead to hair loss. Steroids, blood thinners, antidepressants, and some blood pressure medications may also contribute to hair fall. 6. Scalp infections: Infections of the scalp, including ringworm and bacterial infections, can negatively impact hair follicles, leading to hair loss. 7. Hair styling and excessive grooming: Frequent use of hair styling tools such as flat irons and curling irons, along with harsh chemical treatments like coloring, perming, and hair straightening, may damage hair follicles and weaken strands. Even tight hairstyles like ponytails, braids, and buns that put excessive tension on hair roots can cause a hair fall condition known as traction alopecia. 8. Environmental factors: Exposure to harsh weather, pollution, and excessive sun can damage the hair shaft and contribute to hair fall. It is essential to protect your hair from environmental aggressors by wearing a hat or using a serum with UV protection. 9. Aging: As we age, the natural hair growth cycle begins to slow down, and hair follicles become weak, resulting in thinner hair and increased hair fall. 10. Smoking: Smoking has been linked to hair loss, as it can lead to poor circulation and a reduction in the amount of oxygen reaching the hair follicles, weakening them and causing hair fall over time. To reduce and manage hair fall, it is crucial to address any underlying issues that may be contributing to hair loss, maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle, and minimize exposure to environmental and chemical factors that damage hair. Should hair fall persist or worsen, it is advisable to consult a dermatologist or a trichologist – a specialist in hair and scalp disorders – for an accurate assessment and appropriate treatment plan."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the other hand, the sentiment takes a turn towards the negative when the reviewer claims that the book doesn't contain any new updates, even though it was marketed as such. Referencing it as a \\"replacement\\" for a previous work (Elysium), they assert that this claim is essentially not true as they believe it is the same book. This paints the marketing of the book in a misleading light which creates a negative perspective. The reviewer appears disappointed with the lack of fresh content, a sentiment that may cause prospective readers who already own one or both of the previous books to reconsider their purchase. In conclusion, while the review has elements of praise for the book, the negative elements seem to overshadow them, making the overall tone of the review generally negative. The reviewer criticises the book for a lack of new material and for being falsely marketed as a \\"replacement\\" or update. These aspects may impact potential readers more than the acknowledged value for those who don't already own the original books, consequently shaping the review as primarily negative. Regardless, the effectiveness of this viewpoint primarily depends on the individual reader's perspective—more specifically, whether they already own the previous books or not."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Living With Cancer: Being Mortal Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer. Like many people with advanced-stage cancer, I wonder when I will decide about treatment, “Enough is enough.” In helping me formulate an answer to this question, Atul Gawande’s latest book, “Being Mortal,” will now play an indispensable part. A bestselling doctor-writer, Dr. Gawande has received praise from reviewers better able than I am to assess his judgments on the shortage of geriatric physicians; the damages done by nursing homes that don’t feel like homes; the benefits of experiments in assisted living to alleviate boredom, loneliness and helplessness; and the positive effects of palliative care with respect to the quality and also the quantity of life. But too few cancer patients know how useful his book can be for those dealing with the difficult decisions presented by incurable disease. Dr. Gawande has faced this situation with patients and with someone he loved. From the start of “Being Mortal” to its close, Dr. Gawande highlights the problem of terminal cancer care through poignant case studies that encourage people like me to formulate priorities. He is astute about the financial costs of that care: “25 percent of all Medicare spending is for the 5 percent of patients who are in their final year of life, and most of that money goes for care in their last couple of months that is of little apparent benefit.” And about how the cost pertains to individuals: metastatic breast cancer treatment amounts to “an average of 94,000 during the last year of life.” With respect to the people whose stories he recounts, Dr. Gawande wants us to consider when it is best to stop treatment — not for the pocketbook, but for the patient’s well-being. His opening account about a man with widely metastatic prostate cancer serves as an admonition. The patient he calls Joseph Lazaroff opted for dangerous surgery, and he ended his life in intensive care. Here, as throughout, Dr. Gawande emphasizes his own learning curve. Although at the time he believed that “Mr. Lazaroff had chosen badly,” now he feels that he and his fellow physicians failed to talk honestly about “the larger truth about his condition or the ultimate limits of our capabilities, let alone what might matter most to him as he neared the end of his life.” Another case history, about a new mother with inoperable lung cancer, bears out the view that too many oncologists overestimate their patients’ survival time, remain reluctant to specify a prognosis, and offer treatments unlikely to work. Sara Thomas Monopoli underwent a series of protocols that failed to produce anything except debilitating side effects which, in turn, led to her death in the hospital. The narrative about the decline of Dr. Gawande’s father, a physician, from a slow-growing spinal cancer proves that even doctors need guidance in making complicated decisions when the medical “pressure remains all in one direction, toward doing more.” After surgery, when an oncologist concluded a list of chemotherapy options by promising the senior Dr. Gawande that he could return to the tennis court, his son erupted in rage at such a “daffy” idea. With the help of hospice, the family eventually witnessed the benefits “of living for the best possible day today instead of sacrificing time now for time later.” In “Being Mortal’s” final story about a woman with advanced ovarian cancer, Dr. Gawande dramatizes his own evolution from an informative to an interpretive physician. He expresses his worries, instead of listing the choices she could make, and asks about her fears, concerns and goals. Their collaborative decision to go ahead with surgery, but without taking risks, leads to the insertion of drainage tubes that relieve her nausea and pain when she returns home to die. Dr. Gawande sets out to teach doctors not to try to fix what may be unfixable but to engage in helping patients conclude their life stories in a manner congruent with their values and with a full understanding of the risks and costs of the trade-offs they are willing to make. He has taught me as a patient that even though I have expressed my desire to die at home with hospice, I really have no idea how I will die. I need to ask my oncologist what problems I may encounter when malignancies grow and which methods will be tried to alleviate discomfort. This will not be an easy conversation, but focusing on comfort when cure is impossible may make the rest of my life and my family’s existence less difficult. Like Dr. Gawande senior, I doubt that a few added months of an incapacitated existence would constitute a sufficient trade-off for my going through the pain, debilitation and expense of aggressive end-of-life measures. I am grateful that his son is helping to usher in more humane registers of care that will enable patients to contemplate and decide what we want and don’t want while we are dying. Though few of us can control our ultimate fate, one of the rare benefits bequeathed by cancer is the opportunity it gives us — albeit in grim circumstances — to author our sense of an appropriate ending, whether or not it occurs the way we imagine it.

I got out of bed knowing I am going to commit suicide.I don't know where, but I do know how. I didn't want to do it at home. I printed out my suicide notes for everybody and hid it somewhere in my room. As I got ready, I took one last glanced to my dad. I gathered all my medications shoved it in to my bag and went out outside caught the bus that goes to college. I had no plans on going into my classes; I sat onto the college bus stop contemplating if I am going to do it. I did it. I chugged down the whole bottle of my anti-depressant. I closed my eyes for a brief moment, I felt like I was about to faint; I checked my phone to see what time was it and I saw my daughter's face on my home screen.

Movie title: Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy Movie plot: In October 1973, \\"Control\\", head of British intelligence (\\"the Circus\\"), sends agent Jim Prideaux to Budapest to meet a Hungarian general wishing to defect. Prideaux is shot and captured. Amid the international incident that follows, Control and his right-hand man George Smiley are forced into retirement. Control dies of illness. Percy Alleline becomes the new Chief, with Bill Haydon as his deputy, and Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase as key lieutenants. Despite Control and Smiley's misgivings, their successors had already begun a secret operationâ\\"Witchcraft\\"âto obtain Soviet intelligence, which is being exchanged with the CIA for US intelligence. Smiley is brought out of retirement by Oliver Lacon, the civil servant in charge of intelligence, to investigate a claim by Ricki Tarr, a British spy, that there has been a long-term mole in a senior role in the Circus, as Control had suspected. Smiley chooses a trustworthy agent, Peter Guillam, and retired Special Branch officer Mendel to help him. He interviews Connie Sachs, who was sacked by Alleline after deducing that Alexei Polyakov, a Soviet cultural attachÃ© in London, was a spy. Tarr tells Smiley that, on a mission to Istanbul, he had had an affair with Irina, a Soviet agent. She wanted to reveal the name of a mole in the top ranks of the Circus, but when Tarr reported this to London, they ignored him and ordered him straight home, whereas Moscow immediately kidnapped Irina. Tarr concluded that the mole had intercepted his message, and went into hiding, suspected of defecting and murdering the British station chief. Smiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr called: he finds the pages for that night are cut out, suggesting that Tarr's story is true. Smiley interviews Prideaux, who after brutal interrogation was exchanged by the Soviets but sacked from the service. Prideaux says the purpose of the mission to Hungary was to get the name of the mole. Control had codenamed the suspects \\"Tinker\\" (Alleline), \\"Tailor\\" (Haydon), \\"Soldier\\"...

The premise \\"yeah oh that's outstanding\\" implies a highly positive response, and it may be related to an event, achievement, or situation that exceeds expectations. The speaker seems to be expressing their admiration, approval, and perhaps even a sense of amazement. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"That's great to hear!\\" indicates a positive and supportive response from the listener, expressing happiness and possibly relief in response to good news. While both statements involve a positive reaction, they don't necessarily entail one another. The premise \\"yeah oh that's outstanding\\" may occur independently and doesn't automatically guarantee the presence of the hypothesis' response. Similarly, someone could say \\"That's great to hear!\\" in reaction to various positive news or updates, not specifically related to the premise. However, it is important to note that even though it is not possible to tell with absolute certainty whether the premise entails the hypothesis, there is a possibility that they could be connected in a conversational context. If someone were to respond, \\"Yeah oh that's outstanding,\\" to shared news or information, another individual might reply with the hypothesis, \\"That's great to hear!\\" in response to the positive reaction. In such a situation, the two statements are related, although not entailing each other directly. In conclusion, while both the premise and the hypothesis share a positive sentiment, one cannot conclusively determine that the presence of the premise automatically entails the hypothesis. They may or may not be related in a specific context, but there is no logical basis to assert that the premise \\"yeah oh that's outstanding\\" necessarily leads to the hypothesis \\"That's great to hear!\\" Thus, the correct answer is that it is not possible to tell."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Use evidence from the fact that natural magnetism is used for pointing north by a compass to answer this question: \\"What force causes a compass in Illinois to point towards Wisconsin?\\"","output":"The force causing a compass in Illinois to point towards Wisconsin is primarily the Earth's magnetic field. This detailed and long answer will cover the principles of magnetism, the Earth's magnetic field, and how a compass works to ultimately explain why a compass in Illinois points towards Wisconsin. 1. Principles of Magnetism: Magnetism is a fundamental force in nature, and it occurs due to the movement of charged particles, generally electrons. All magnets have two poles: the north pole and the south pole. By convention, the north pole of a magnet is the one attracted to Earth's geographic North Pole, while the south pole is attracted to the Earth's geographic South Pole. As a general rule, opposite magnetic poles attract each other, while like poles repel each other. 2. Earth's Magnetic Field: The Earth itself acts as a giant magnet, primarily due to its core, which consists of an inner solid core and an outer liquid core. The outer core is composed mainly of molten iron and nickel, which are conductive materials. As the Earth rotates and the liquid core moves, it generates electric currents, producing a magnetic field around the planet. The Earth's magnetic field resembles that of a bar magnet, with imaginary lines of magnetic force connecting the magnetic North and South Poles. However, it is essential to note some differences between Earth's magnetic poles and geographic poles. The geographic poles mark the axis around which the Earth rotates, while the magnetic poles are where Earth's magnetic field lines converge. These magnetic poles do not align precisely with the geographic poles, and their positions shift over time. As of 2021, the Earth's Magnetic North Pole is located at approximately 86° N latitude and 160° E longitude, near Ellesmere Island in Canada. 3. How a Compass Works: A compass is a navigational tool used to determine a direction relative to the Earth's magnetic field. It consists of a small magnetic needle on a free-moving pivot, allowing it to move and align itself with the Earth's magnetic field. The needle of a compass has a north pole (usually the red tip) and a south pole. When exposed to Earth's magnetic field, the south pole of the compass needle is attracted to the magnetic north pole, while the north pole of the compass needle is attracted to the magnetic south pole. 4. Why a Compass in Illinois Points Towards Wisconsin: Now, let's consider the specific case of using a compass in Illinois. A person located in Illinois, United States, would be in the northern hemisphere, which means that the south pole of the compass needle would be attracted to Earth's magnetic north pole. Since the Earth's magnetic north pole is near Ellesmere Island in Canada, and Wisconsin is to the north of Illinois, the south pole of the compass needle would align itself with the Earth's magnetic field lines, pointing towards the magnetic north pole. As a result, when using a compass in Illinois, the needle would naturally point towards Wisconsin, as it is the direction closer to Earth's magnetic north pole in the region. However, keep in mind that magnetic declination, the angle between geographic north and magnetic north, does vary by location, and may cause deviations from the true geographic north. This factor should be taken into account when using a compass for navigation purposes. In conclusion, the force causing a compass in Illinois to point towards Wisconsin is the Earth's magnetic field, which results from the movements of the molten materials in the Earth's outer core. The compass aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field lines, ultimately pointing in the direction of the magnetic north pole, which in the context of Illinois, is towards Wisconsin."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  Magma comes up to the surface of the earth - The magma cools - Particles inside the magma move closer together - Crystals are formed A:","output":"The final step of the process is: The formation of igneous rocks. To recap the entire process: 1. Magma rises to the Earth's surface due to buoyancy forces and pressure from tectonic activity or volcanic eruptions. 2. As the magma reaches the surface or near the surface, it starts cooling down. 3. As the magma cools, particles within it move closer together, causing them to solidify. The rate of cooling can have a significant impact on the size and structure of the crystals formed. 4. During this cooling process, mineral crystals form due to the arrangement and bonding of these particles. 5. When all the magma has cooled and solidified with the mineral crystals formed throughout, the end result is the formation of igneous rocks. There are two types of igneous rocks depending on where the magma cools and solidifies: intrusive (when the magma solidifies beneath the Earth's surface) and extrusive (when the magma solidifies on the Earth's surface, usually after a volcanic eruption). The size and structure of the crystals can differ depending on the rate of cooling and the composition of the magma, giving rise to the variety of igneous rocks that exist."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pick a tall plant so they have plenty of room to climb. Stick to a small pot, however, so they can find their food at the base more easily.  Choose a plant with plentiful wide leaves so the mantis has adequate shade to escape the sun. Since your mantis won’t be enclosed, be sure to select a breed that doesn’t develop wings so it doesn’t fly away and escape!  If the pot is circular, the diameter of the surface area should be at least three times wider than the mantis’s body length. If the pot is box-shaped, it should be twice as wide as the mantis’s body length and three times as long. Place it on a windowsill so the plant receives direct sunlight and remains healthy. If your windowsill is too narrow, place your plant where sunlight can reach it. Be sure to keep it out of reach of other pets, since dogs or cats may eat your mantis. Collect or purchase other insects with soft bodies to use as pet food. Be sure to use live prey that is only a quarter of the size of the mantis itself. If possible, feed them insects that don’t fly so they don’t escape.  When using a caged enclosure to house your mantis, it’s recommended to keep a continuous supply of food. But since you’re not using a cage, be vigilant with feeding to make sure the mantis is eating regularly. Keep the soil free of fallen leaves or other obstructions where prey can hide. Try using tweezers to offer food. This way you can gauge how hungry your mantis is as well as use prey that is able to fly or otherwise escape. Fruit flies are a popular food for smaller mantises, and crickets for larger ones. Keep the room temperature warm. Mist the leaves and soil regularly to maintain proper humidity. Since you’re keeping your mantis in the open instead of an enclosure, keep a sharp eye on the soil to make sure it doesn’t dry out.  If prolonged sunlight dries your plant quickly on a regular basis, rotate the plant between direct sunlight (for the plant’s health) to other areas in the room where the sun doesn’t reach (to maintain moisture). Between regular misting and the moisture received from eating prey, the mantis shouldn’t need another water source. However, for your own peace of mind if this is a concern, go ahead and give it a small water bowl. Summary:","output":"To care for a mantis without a cage, give each mantis a tall plant with wide leaves in a small pot, make sure they can't fly away, feed them live insects, and keep the plant in sunlight while maintaining the right temperature and humidity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fossils can be used to match up rock layers. As organisms change over time, they look different. Older fossils will look different than younger fossils. Some organisms only survived for a short time before going extinct. Knowing what organisms looked like at certain times also helps date rock layers. Some fossils are better than others for this use. The fossils that are very distinct at certain times of Earths history are called index fossils. Index fossils are commonly used to match rock layers. You can see how this works in Figure 2.30.

The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal. Their style drew from a wide variety of influences, including blues, psychedelia, and folk music. In November 1978, the group recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The resulting album, In Through the Out Door, featured sonic experimentation that again drew mixed reactions from critics. Nevertheless, the album reached number one in the UK and the US in just its second week of release. With this album's release, Led Zeppelin's entire catalogue returned to the Billboard Top 200 in the weeks of 27 October and 3 November 1979.  In August 1979, after two warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing to a crowd of approximately 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert came to an abrupt halt in the middle of the third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.  A North American tour, the band's first since 1977, was scheduled to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24 September, Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (from 16 to 24 US fl oz (470 to 710 ml)), with a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll he said to his assistant, \\"breakfast\\". He continued to drink heavily after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's house--the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor.  After midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45 pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was asphyxiation from vomit; the finding was accidental death. An autopsy found no other recreational drugs in Bonham's body. Although he had recently begun to take Motival (a cocktail of the antipsychotic fluphenazine and the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline) to combat his anxiety, it is unclear if these substances interacted with the alcohol in his system. Bonham's remains were cremated and his ashes interred on 12 October 1980, at Rushock parish church, Worcestershire.  The planned North American tour was cancelled, and despite rumours that Cozy Powell, Carmine Appice, Barriemore Barlow, Simon Kirke, or Bev Bevan would join the group as his replacement, the remaining members decided to disband. A 4 December 1980 press statement stated that, \\"We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were.\\" The statement was signed simply \\"Led Zeppelin\\".

The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Answer:","output":"The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) invented the biological system of nomenclature used to classify plants and animals. He developed a hierarchical system of classification, called the Linnaean System, which is based on the morphological similarities and differences among organisms. This system is still the foundation of modern taxonomy. In the Linnaean System, organisms are classified into a series of increasingly specific categories, starting from the broadest category called \\"Kingdom\\" and moving to the more specific categories such as \\"Phylum,\\" \\"Class,\\" \\"Order,\\" \\"Family,\\" \\"Genus,\\" and \\"Species.\\" These groups are known as taxa (singular: taxon). Each organism is assigned a unique scientific name, which consists of the genus and species names, in a naming convention known as binomial nomenclature.

Answer the following question: Background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  Paragraph: Two friends studied permaculture together. Bill studied about mycorrhiza, while Red studied about hugel kultur.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend learned less about surface areas of root systems? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided paragraph, Red, who studied hugelkultur, learned less about surface areas of root systems compared to Bill, who studied mycorrhiza. Hugelkultur is a permaculture technique that involves building raised garden beds filled with rotting wood, which helps retain moisture and improve soil fertility as the wood decomposes. While hugelkultur is an excellent method for improving soil health and promoting plant growth, it does not specifically focus on the surface area of plant root systems. On the other hand, Bill studied mycorrhiza, which is a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and the roots of a plant. This association directly affects the surface area of the plant's root system, as the mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area, allowing for better absorption of water and nutrients from the soil. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that Bill learned more about surface areas of root systems compared to Red, who learned less about that specific topic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There was to be a good deal of dancing, and before it had gone very far, Marian Almond came up to Catherine, in company with a tall young man. She introduced the young man as a person who had a great desire to make our heroine's acquaintance, and as a cousin of Arthur Townsend, her own intended.  Marian Almond was a pretty little person of seventeen, with a very small figure and a very big sash, to the elegance of whose manners matrimony had nothing to add. She already had all the airs of a hostess, receiving the company, shaking her fan, saying that with so many people to attend to she should have no time to dance. She made a long speech about Mr. Townsend's cousin, to whom she administered a tap with her fan before turning away to other cares. Catherine had not understood all that she said; her attention was given to enjoying Marian's ease of manner and flow of ideas, and to looking at the young man, who was remarkably handsome. She had succeeded, however, as she often failed to do when people were presented to her, in catching his name, which appeared to be the same as that of Marian's little stockbroker. Catherine was always agitated by an introduction; it seemed a difficult moment, and she wondered that some people--her new acquaintance at this moment, for instance-- should mind it so little. She wondered what she ought to say, and what would be the consequences of her saying nothing. The consequences at present were very agreeable.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many fewer Chinese residents were there in Spain compared to German?","output":"Title: A Comparative Analysis of Chinese and German Residents in Spain Introduction Over the past few decades, immigration has been a central topic in the European Union, as people from different countries seek better opportunities and quality of life. In Spain, one of the member countries of the European Union, the demographic landscape has been reshaped by thousands of immigrants from all over the world, including China and Germany. This article aims to explore and compare the number of Chinese and German residents in Spain, providing an understanding of the scale of immigration from these two countries. Chinese Residents in Spain China has seen a boom in the number of its citizens migrating to other countries in search of better living standards, education, and job opportunities. Spain has been one of the go-to destinations for Chinese immigrants in Europe, mainly due to its pleasant weather, cheaper living costs, and business opportunities. According to the Spanish National Institute of Statistics (INE), as of January 2021, there were approximately 215,196 Chinese residents in Spain. The Chinese community is predominantly represented in major cities like Madrid and Barcelona. Chinese immigrants are engaged in various sectors, such as trade, catering, and other small- to medium-sized businesses. The number of Chinese residents has grown rapidly over the years, making them one of the most significant communities of immigrants in Spain. German Residents in Spain Germany, as a fellow European Union member state and one of the most prominent countries in terms of economic strength, has a different immigration pattern with Spain. Traditionally, the migration from Germany to Spain has been mainly prompted by the search for a warmer climate and a more relaxed atmosphere, particularly among retirees. According to INE data from January 2021, there were around 138,141 German residents in Spain. These numbers have been relatively stable over the past few years. Unlike Chinese immigrants, Germans in Spain are more dispersed throughout the country and can be found mainly in coastal regions and tourist areas, such as Mallorca, the Costa del Sol, and the Canary Islands. Many Germans in Spain are also engaged in the tourism sector, owning vacation properties or investing in local businesses. Comparative Analysis Based on the aforementioned data, the difference in the number of Chinese and German residents in Spain is evident. As of January 2021, there were approximately 77,055 fewer Chinese residents in Spain compared to German residents. This disparity can be attributed to several factors, including cultural, historical, and economic reasons.  China's rapid economic growth and vast population have fueled the migration of many Chinese citizens to European countries, including Spain. As mentioned earlier, the increase in Chinese residents in Spain can be mainly attributed to significant investments in trade, businesses, and seeking a better lifestyle. On the other hand, German residents in Spain are driven more by the quest for a relaxed atmosphere, typically for retirement purposes, and warmer climates. Many Germans find the Spanish lifestyle appealing, and the tourism industry in Spain has been significantly shaped by German investments. Conclusion Spain has become a melting pot of diverse cultures and communities, thanks to the influx of immigration from different parts of the world. While many factors have led Chinese and German residents to look for better opportunities and lifestyles in Spain, as of January 2021, there were significantly fewer Chinese residents (around 77,055) in comparison to their German counterparts. Understanding the reasons and patterns of immigration from these two countries is important as it helps the Spanish government and policymakers devise suitable strategies for integration and investment policies that cater to the unique needs of each community and, overall, contribute positively to the Spanish economy and society."},{"instruction":"Q:Information:  - The University of Southern California (USC or SC) is a private research university founded in 1880 with its main campus in Los Angeles, California.

Researchers have found that those who eat a handful of peanuts every day significantly decrease their risk of dying from all causes compared to those who do not eat nuts. A new study concludes that all types of nuts seem to be protective. Researcher Ying Bao is with the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. She and her colleagues looked at the impact of nut consumption by analyzing two huge studies that began in 1980 - the Nurses' Health Study, which tracks the of more than 76,000 women, and 42,000 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Among the questions asked at the beginning of the studies was, 'how frequently do you eat nuts?'  The information was updated every two to four years. Bao says the participants were followed for three decades. \\"What we observed is that people who eat more nuts are less likely to die over the next 30 years,\\" said Bao. \\"So, for example, if a person eat(s) nuts once per day, that person has a 20 percent lower risk of dying.\\" Bao says eating a handful of nuts five or more times per week was associated with a 29 percent reduced risk of dying from heart disease and an 11 percent lower risk of cancer death.  A serving size is 28 grams. Nuts contain nutrients, including high quality proteins, vitamins and minerals, all of which have anti-cancer effects and may help protect the heart. Bao says researchers are planning studies to find out how nuts are beneficial to human health.

As the muggers check their seemingly unconscious victim for cash, The Man regains consciousness and brutally kills them. Around that time, Inspector Peter Neilson is investigating the apparent murder scene of the young Melissa and Nikki. In a flashback, the two girls are shown in a goth club looking to pick up men. Melissa spotted The Man and took him home. After spending the night with him, she began hallucinating about the people around turning to her with monstrous faces and voices. Melissa went to Nikki's house to seek help, then a creature burst out of Melissa's womb and attacked Nikki, killing both. Sophie and Emma break into a house in a burglary attempt. When Emma finds a box of money under a bed, a bony old man pops up from the bedcovers and attacks her. The girls stab and bludgeon the old man multiple times before he finally dies. Intending to keep the loot to herself and seeing Emma as a liability for revealing their plan to her sister, Sophie kills Emma and runs home. There, the re-animated bodies of Emma and the old man appear and stab Sophie to death. As the dead bodies are identified, Inspector Neilson links them to an earlier case he had solved in the past.

As Beshraavi's men search for David, Beshraavi demonstrates to one of Yasmin's employees, Hemsley, that he can buy people for their loyalty or else exact extreme revenge.  Forced to show himself, David seemingly abducts Yasmin. They flee from one of Beshraavi's henchmen, Mustapha. In the course of the chase, Mustapha and David struggle at the zoological gardens, when another man intervenes and kills Mustapha. He identifies himself as Inspector Webster with CID. When a guard approaches, Webster kills him before revealing that he is working with Yasmin. Webster knocks David unconscious. Answer:","output":"Hemsley is employed by Nejim Beshraavi. In the article, it mentions that Beshraavi demonstrates to one of Yasmin's employees, Hemsley, that he can buy people for their loyalty or else exact extreme revenge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose baton Monteux studied under?, using the article: Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The last name of the person whose baton Monteux studied under is Nikisch. In the text, it is mentioned that \\"As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Huge shock waves radiate out from the blast site. On board the USS Excelsior, Captain Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) makes an official entry in his log, noting that his mission of \\"cataloging gaseous anomalies in Beta Quadrant\\" is over and they are returning to Earth. The ship is suddenly struck by one of the shock waves from the explosion. Sulu orders his crew to restore control to the ship, which is done quickly. Looking over their scanning equipment, the crew determines that the shock wave originated at the location of the Klingon moon Praxis. Sulu remarks that Praxis is the primary source of energy for the Klingon Empire, and orders a message be sent stating he and his crew will assist if necessary. They receive an emergency transmission from Praxis showing a Klingon worker consumed in flames. A second message comes from Brigadier General Kerla (Paul Rossilli) that acknowledges the explosion (he calls it \\"an incident\\") and that they do not require assistance from the Federation. He also commands them to stay out of the Neutral Zone. When one of the crew asks if they should report the incident, Sulu replies \\"Are you kidding??\\"On Earth two months later, Captain James Kirk (William Shatner), Dr Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) and Engineer Montgomery Scott (James Doohan) attend a top-level meeting of Starfleet.

He tells the committee that the explosion of Praxis two months earlier has caused an environmental catastrophe on the Klingon homeworld of Q'ono'S (Kronos). Pollution of the planet's ozone layer has left Klingon civilization with only 50 Earth years of oxygen. The Klingon Empire, due to its enormous military budget, is unable to reverse the devastation and has turned to the Federation for assistance. However, as Spock notes, assistance cannot begin until a treaty...

Afterward all the local newspapers carried many human-interest stories featuring some of the families who suffered the hardest. One Sunday, a particular picture especially touched me. A young woman stood in front of an entirely shattered mobile home, a depressed expression twisting her features. A young boy, seven or eight years old, stood at her side, eyes downcast. Clutching     at her skirt was a tiny girl who stared into the camera, eyes wide with confusion and fear. The article that went with the picture gave the clothing sizes of each family member. With growing interest, I noticed that their sizes closely matched ours. This would be a good opportunity to teach my children to help those less fortunate than themselves. I taped the picture of the young family to our refrigerator, explaining their difficulty to my seven-year-old twins, Brad and Brett, and to three- year-old Meghan. \\" We have so much. And these poor people now have nothing,\\" I said.\\"We'll share what we have with them.\\" I brought three large boxes down from the room upstairs and placed them on the living room floor. Meghan watched seriously, as the boys and I filled one of the boxes with canned goods and foods. While I sorted through our clothes, I encouraged the boys to go through their toys and donate some of their less favorite things. Meghan watched quietly as the boys piled up discarded toys and games. \\"I'll help you find something for the little girl when I'm done with this,\\" I said. The boys placed the toys they had chosen to donate into one of the boxes while I filled the third box with clothes. Meghan walked up with Lucy, her worn, faded, much-loved rag doll hugged tightly to her chest. She paused in front of the box that held the toys, pressed her round little face into Lucy's flat, painted-on-face, gave her a final kiss, then laid her gently on top of the other toys. \\"Oh, Honey,\\" I said.\\"You don't have to give Lucy.

Apply the dry mixture to your toothbrush.\\"","output":"Title: Embrace the Benefits of Tooth Powder: A Wholesome and Natural Alternative for Oral Care Introduction In a world where oral care products are abundant, finding the right one for your needs can be a daunting task. However, you don't always have to rely on commercial toothpaste. Tooth powder, an eco-friendly alternative, has been gaining popularity for its potential benefits and easy DIY approach. This article seeks to explore the benefits of tooth powder ingredients while providing a simple guide on how to mix and apply it for daily oral care. Step 1: Recognize the benefits of tooth powder ingredients To create an effective tooth powder, it's essential to understand the benefits of each ingredient. By recognizing their individual properties, you can combine just what you need to ensure a well-rounded oral health routine. Here are a few common ingredients found in tooth powder and their benefits: 1. Baking soda: Baking soda is a gentle abrasive that helps to remove plaque and surface stains, making it perfect for cleaning and whitening teeth. It also neutralizes acids responsible for bad breath and balances the mouth's pH levels to maintain optimal oral hygiene.    2. Calcium carbonate: This natural compound found in rocks, shells, and pearls helps remove stains, strengthen tooth enamel, and promote overall dental health. 3. Bentonite clay: Bentonite clay is a powerful detoxifier that binds to toxins and absorbs harmful bacteria, providing an extra layer of protection for your teeth and gums while gently polishing away stains. 4. Activated charcoal: Activated charcoal is known for its potent detoxifying, deodorizing, and stain-removing properties. When used in tooth powder, it can help whiten teeth by lifting external stains from coffee, tea, and red wine. 5. Essential oils: Essential oils, such as clove, peppermint, and cinnamon, provide many oral care benefits. They possess antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that can help fight off harmful bacteria, reduce plaque buildup, and alleviate bad breath while adding a pleasant flavor to your tooth powder. Step 2: Combine ingredients and mix thoroughly Once you've chosen the ingredients suitable for your needs, follow these simple steps to create your own tooth powder: 1. Measure out the desired amounts of each ingredient. A basic recipe could be 3 parts baking soda, 2 parts calcium carbonate, 1 part bentonite clay, and a small amount of activated charcoal. Essential oils can be added as desired, typically around 10-20 drops. 2. Combine all the measured ingredients in a non-metallic container, such as glass or ceramic. 3. Mix thoroughly to ensure a consistent blend. You can use a spoon, whisk, or shake the container with a lid. 4. Store the mixture in an airtight container, away from heat and moisture. Your tooth powder should last for several months. Step 3: Apply the dry mixture to your toothbrush Using tooth powder is as easy as commercial toothpaste. Follow these steps for optimal application and clean teeth: 1. Wet your toothbrush with water. 2. Dip the bristles of your toothbrush into the tooth powder or tap a small amount onto the toothbrush. 3. Brush your teeth as you would normally do with toothpaste, moving in small circular motions for at least two minutes, ensuring all surfaces are covered. 4. Rinse your mouth and toothbrush with water thoroughly, removing any residual powder and debris. Conclusion Tooth powder offers a natural, environmentally friendly, and customizable alternative to traditional toothpaste. By understanding the benefits of each ingredient and learning how to mix and apply the powder, you can create a personalized oral care routine tailored to your needs. Embrace tooth powder, and enjoy the path towards improved dental health and a more sustainable lifestyle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Oystein Aarseth (Norwegian: ['oystein 'os@t]; 22 March 1968 - 10 August 1993), better known by his stage name Euronymous, was a Norwegian guitarist. Euronymous was a founder of and central figure in the early Norwegian black metal scene. He was a co-founder of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem. He was also founder and owner of the extreme metal record label Deathlike Silence Productions and record shop Helvete. In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes, and between Euronymous and the Swedish black metal scene.  On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous' apartment at Toyengata in Oslo. Upon their arrival a confrontation began and Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found on the stairs outside the apartment with 23 stab wounds - two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back. Euronymous' murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media.  It has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at \\"outdoing\\" the stabbing in Lillehammer. Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up and torture him to death while videotaping the event. Vikernes explains: \\"If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me\\". He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him. Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes climbed the stairs to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor. Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous \\"panicked\\" and kicked him in the chest. The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes defends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle. After the murder, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes. The self-defense story is doubted by Faust and other members of the scene.  According to Vikernes, Blackthorn only came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs and was \\"in the wrong place at the wrong time\\". Blackthorn claims that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost committed to a mental hospital but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. He said Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. Blackthorn said of the murder, \\"I was neither for nor against it. I didn't give a shit about Oystein\\". Vikernes called Blackthorn's claims a \\"defense [...] to make sure I couldn't blame him [for the murder]\\".  Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were also taken in for questioning. The trial began on 2 May 1994. At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn and another friend had planned the murder. The third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi. To make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card. On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, \\"presumably as a statement of symbolic support\\". Blackthorn was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice.  At Euronymous' funeral, Hellhammer (Mayhem's then-drummer) and Necrobutcher (Mayhem's former bassist) decided to continue with the band and worked on releasing the De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas album. Before the release, Euronymous' family asked Hellhammer to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: \\"I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did\\". The album, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar, was finally released in May 1994.  A part of the Norwegian scene considered Vikernes a traitor for murdering Euronymous and turning his back on Satanism in favor of nationalism and Odinism, although Vikernes claims he was never a Satanist and had only used 'Satan' to provoke. They saw Euronymous' death as a significant loss to the scene, and some black metallers \\"have sworn to avenge Aarseth's death\\". A few years after the murder, Ihsahn of Emperor said \\"There's no discipline in the scene anymore, like earlier on around the shop\\". After his death, a new generation of musicians tried to gain credibility by 'hyping-up' Euronymous, although he was also hailed as \\"the King\\" or \\"Godfather of Black Metal\\" by bands that had emerged before this new generation. However, many of Euronymous' friends and bandmates \\"speak of the killing with a tone of indifference\\". Lords of Chaos remarks: \\"what is striking [...] is how little they care about the lives or deaths of one another\\". In the book, Hellhammer, Ihsahn and Samoth claim that Euronymous' death did not affect or at least not shock them. Anders Odden (a friend of Euronymous at the time) said of the murder: \\"It wasn't odd that he ended up getting killed. He thought he could threaten to kill people without it having any consequences\\". He added: \\"I think many people felt relief once he was gone\\". Writer and musician Erlend Erichsen agreed, saying \\"Nobody was there to boss them about. The 'black metal police' were gone\\".  The book Lords of Chaos says of Euronymous:  He was always dressed in black from head to foot, his hair dyed black for added effect. He sported long, aristocratic mustaches and wore knee-high boots. His black leather biker jacket was decorated with badges [...] When talking, he seemed stern and serious, sometimes with pomposity verging on the theatrical\\".  In interviews, Euronymous claimed to be against individualism, compassion, peace, happiness and fun. He claimed he wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil. In a 1993 interview he said \\"There is NOTHING which is too sick, evil or perverted\\". Metalion (who knew Euronymous since 1985 and considered him to be his best friend) said that Euronymous \\"was always telling what he thought, following his own instincts [...] worshipping death and being extreme\\". Ihsahn, who frequented Helvete, said that \\"if you were trusted, if they knew you were serious in your views, you were accepted\\" there, which was important to be a part of the Helvete scene.  However, Lords of Chaos claims that many who knew Euronymous say \\"the extreme Satanic image he projected was, in fact, just that - a projection which bore little resemblance to his real personality\\".

Nixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace. Following the announcement of his visit to China, the Nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the Soviet Union. The President and First Lady arrived in Moscow on May 22, 1972 and met with Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Communist Party; Alexei Kosygin, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers; and Nikolai Podgorny, the head of state, among other leading Soviet officials.  Nixon engaged in intense negotiations with Brezhnev. Out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of \\"peaceful coexistence\\". A banquet was held that evening at the Kremlin.  Seeking to foster better relations with the United States, both China and the Soviet Union cut back on their diplomatic support for North Vietnam and advised Hanoi to come to terms militarily. Nixon later described his strategy:  I had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in Vietnam was to enlist, if possible, the help of the Soviets and the Chinese. Though rapprochement with China and detente with the Soviet Union were ends in themselves, I also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war. At worst, Hanoi was bound to feel less confident if Washington was dealing with Moscow and Beijing. At best, if the two major Communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry, Hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept.  Having made considerable progress over the previous two years in U.S.-Soviet relations, Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974. He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony, cheering crowds, and a state dinner at the Grand Kremlin Palace that evening. Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta, where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, detente, and MIRVs. While he considered proposing a comprehensive test-ban treaty, Nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it. There were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations. Answer this question \\"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article. Some of them include: 1. Nixon's strategy of using rapprochement with China and détente with the Soviet Union as a means to potentially hasten the end of the Vietnam War. This approach showcases the complex nature of international relations and the interconnectedness of major events during that time. 2. The fact that both China and the Soviet Union reduced their diplomatic support for North Vietnam in an effort to foster better relations with the United States. This demonstrates the intricate balance of power and alliances during the Cold War era. 3. The two landmark arms control treaties, SALT I and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, that emerged from the summit between Nixon and Brezhnev. These treaties marked significant steps toward limiting the arms race and promoting stability between competing superpowers. 4. Nixon's second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974, which further demonstrates the ongoing efforts to maintain and improve diplomatic relations between the two major superpowers despite the lack of significant breakthroughs in subsequent negotiations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was the organizing principle of rural economy that originated in the Roman villa system of the Late Roman Empire, and was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe. It was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract. Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor, supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor (sometimes called a fief), and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court. Context: The term is most often used with reference to medieval Western Europe. Antecedents of the system can be traced to the rural economy of the later Roman Empire (Dominate). With a declining birthrate and population, labor was the key factor of production. Successive administrations tried to stabilise the imperial economy by freezing the social structure into place: sons were to succeed their fathers in their trade, councilors were forbidden to resign, and coloni, the cultivators of land, were not to move from the land they were attached to. The workers of the land were on their way to becoming serfs.  Several factors conspired to merge the status of former slaves and former free farmers into a dependent class of such coloni: it was possible to be described as servus et colonus, \\"both slave and colonus\\". Laws of Constantine I around 325 both reinforced the semi-servile status of the coloni and limited their rights to sue in the courts; the Codex Theodosianus promulgated under Theodosius II extended these restrictions. The legal status of adscripti, \\"bound to the soil\\", contrasted with barbarian foederati, who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries, remaining subject to their own traditional law.  As the Germanic kingdoms succeeded Roman authority in the West in the fifth century, Roman landlords were often simply replaced by Germanic ones, with little change to the underlying situation or displacement of populations.  The process of rural self-sufficiency was given an abrupt boost in the eighth century, when normal trade in the Mediterranean Sea was disrupted. The thesis put forward by Henri Pirenne, while disputed widely, supposes that the Arab conquests forced the medieval economy into even greater ruralization and gave rise to the classic feudal pattern of varying degrees of servile peasantry underpinning a hierarchy of localised power centers. Question: How widespread was manorialism? Answer:","output":"Manorialism was a really important part of how people lived and worked in the countryside long, long ago, especially in medieval Western Europe. Just like the Roman times, people in the medieval ages needed help to grow food and take care of the land. So, they had a big boss called the Lord of the Manor who owned a big piece of land, which was called a manor. The people, who were like helpers, lived on this land and worked for the Lord. They had to follow his rules and give him some of their food or crops. This way of living and working together was called manorialism. Manorialism was most popular in Western Europe, but it also happened in some parts of Central Europe. It started when the Roman Empire was still around and continued for many years until people began to use money more often to buy and sell things. Then, new ways of working together on the land came up, and this old way called manorialism became less and less popular. So, to answer your question, manorialism was very widespread, especially in Western Europe, but it didn't last forever."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the following context:  After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing...  answer the following question:  Where was Moore when he took timed-sketching classes and saw a cast of the Chac Mool?","output":"There is not enough information available in the given context to answer the question about where Moore was when he took timed-sketching classes and saw a cast of the Chac Mool."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president.

Reus was for long the second city of Catalonia with a population of 14,440 in 1787 and 27,257 in 1860. It was overtaken by Tarragona and Lleida between 1900 and 1930. The population barely grew between 1920 and 1930, with 30,266 and 35,950 inhabitants, respectively. From then, the population growth has been substantial, from 41,014 inhabitants in 1960 to 108,100 inhabitants that the city has as of the end of 2008. Immigration, mostly from Marrakesh, has been a portion of that increase. About 6% are Muslim and 8% from other religions. Which time period saw a smaller increase of population, 1787 to 1860 or 1920 to 1930?","output":"To determine which time period saw a smaller increase in population, we need to calculate the increase for both periods by finding the difference between their respective populations. For the period 1787 to 1860: Population in 1860: 27,257 Population in 1787: 14,440 Increase in population (1860 - 1787): 27,257 - 14,440 = 12,817 For the period 1920 to 1930: Population in 1930: 35,950 Population in 1920: 30,266 Increase in population (1930 - 1920): 35,950 - 30,266 = 5,684 Now we can compare both increases: Increase in population between 1787 and 1860: 12,817 Increase in population between 1920 and 1930: 5,684 The time period that saw a smaller increase in population is 1920 to 1930, with an increase of 5,684 inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nonetheless, some of the best reports have come from observers who entered as fully as possible as participants in the event being investigated. Does it follow that \\"Observers gave reports that were helpful in starting the investigation.\\"?","output":"It can be inferred from the statement that observers who actively participated in the event being investigated were able to provide valuable and insightful reports. However, it is not explicitly mentioned that their reports specifically helped in starting the investigation. The contribution of their reports could have been during any phase of the investigation - from initiation to conclusion. To analyze the statement in-depth, let's break it down into smaller components: 1. Some of the best reports: This refers to a certain set of reports that stand out from the rest in terms of content, accuracy, or usefulness. The statement highlights that these notable reports have a common factor - the high level of participation from the observers. 2. Observers who entered as fully as possible as participants: The statement emphasizes the significance of the observers deeply engaging in the event being investigated. By immersing themselves in the event, these observers were able to gather first-hand experience and knowledge which, in turn, enhanced the quality of their reports. 3. Event being investigated: This indicates that there is an ongoing investigation concerning a certain event. The investigation, which aims to uncover facts and analyze them, may involve multiple phases and numerous methods to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the event. Now, to infer whether the observers' reports were helpful in starting the investigation, we must consider the following points: 1. While the statement lauds the quality of the reports provided by the observers who actively participated in the event, it does not specify at which stage of the investigation these reports were submitted or utilized. 2. The statement implies that the reports were valuable and insightful. However, we cannot assume that the reports were exclusively instrumental as a catalyst to initiate the investigation. 3. The investigation process often necessitates the evaluation of multiple sources of information, which could include the reports from actively participating observers, as well as other pieces of evidence and testimonies from various sources. In conclusion, the statement does not directly imply that \\"Observers gave reports that were helpful in starting the investigation.\\" Instead, it emphasizes the importance of active participation in generating in-depth, useful reports. The reports may have contributed to the investigation in various ways and at different stages, but it cannot be concluded that they were solely responsible for starting the investigation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who had several siblings?, using the article: Florence Fuller was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 1867, a daughter of Louisa and John Hobson Fuller. She had several siblings, including sisters Amy and Christie, both of whom subsequently became singers. The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of Jane Sutherland, referred to in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as \\"the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature\\".Fuller's uncle was Robert Hawker Dowling, a painter of orientalist and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age thirty. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the Royal Academy. He returned to Australia in 1885, and Fuller became his pupil. In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for Barak–last chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines, a formal oil on canvas portrait of the Indigenous Australian leader, William Barak. Ultimately, that painting was acquired by the State Library of Victoria. Although the painting is an important work regularly used to illustrate this significant figure in Australia's history, interpretations of Fuller's portrait are mixed: one critic noted the painting's objectivity and avoidance of romanticising Aboriginal people, while another concluded that \\"Fuller is painting an ideal rather than a person\\".In 1886, Dowling returned to his native England.

The crowd starts to form, with people pausing their busy lives to appreciate the impromptu performance. The man who closed his eyes, inhaling from the phonograph, seems to be transported to a different world entirely. His features relax, and as he exhales, his black jacket is inflated with life. It forms a beautiful contrast with the scene, symbolizing the transporting power of music. In perfect harmony with the rhythm, another man in a white hat joins the dancers.

Today, we'll learn how to grow a field full of pretty flowers that all look the same! We start with cuttings (that's like taking a little piece of one flower and making it grow into a new one). Let's go step by step: 1. Grow from cuttings: To have a field with flowers that look the same, we use cuttings. You take a small piece from a flower you like, and we'll make it grow into a brand new flower!  2. Prepare your soil: Soil is like a cozy bed for flowers. It's where our little flower friends live. We need to make the soil clean and comfy for them. This means removing any rocks, sticks, or yucky things.  3. Check the pH of the soil: Flowers like their soil to be just the right mix of food. We need to find out if the soil has too much or too little food inside. This is called the pH. If it's not just right, we can add more stuff to the soil to make it perfect! 4. Plant a 'green manure' crop: This might sound funny, but it's a great way to keep our flower's bed comfy. We plant a different kind of plant before we grow our flowers (like planting veggies before dessert). These plants help make the soil strong and healthy for our pretty flowers. 5. Plan the space between our flower friends: We need to make sure our flowers have enough space to grow and be happy. We will decide how wide (from side to side) the rows of flowers will be. 6. Dig little homes for our flowers: It's time to dig small holes in the soil for our flowers to live in. Make sure the holes are big enough so the flower can grow happily! 7. Plant the baby flowers and give them water: We'll put our young flowers (from the cuttings) into their holes and cover their feet with soil. Then, we give them a nice drink of water. They will be so happy! 8. Make a watering system: Our flowers get thirsty! We create a special watering system that helps us give water to our flower friends when they need it. It's like building their very own water park! 9. Keep taking care of your flowers: Our flowers will need lots of love and care. We must make sure they get enough water, sunlight, and food (in the form of nutrients) so they can grow and look beautiful! And that's it! If you follow these steps, you will have a lovely field full of flowers that all look the same. Your field will be the talk of the town, and you will make your flowers so proud! Now, let's start growing our flowers!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

(June 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Introduction: The title card is shown as a billboard behind which Wile E. Coyote is hiding, ready to chase the Road Runner. He starts the chase, until he runs into a large truck. Wile E. runs the other way, and the truck shows the credit. The chase ends in a win for the truck, and the Coyote emerges battered. A box with director Chuck Jones' credit then squashes him. The Coyote throws the box away, and the shot freezes: COYOTE - Eatius Birdius. He resumes the chase, which freezes to show the Road Runner: Delicius-Delicius. The chase continues down the road until the Road Runner makes a U-turn. The Coyote turns around, then stops. The Road Runner completes the circuit around, meanwhile, and beeps as the Coyote turns around, causing him to leap back. The Road Runner starts off down the road and loosens it from its hinge briefly. Wile E. points worriedly and displays an \\"EGAD\\" sign, then an \\"!!\\" sign. He drops them and thinks of his new plan. 1. Wile E. hides in a manhole, and as the Road Runner passes over him, he pops out and fires a rifle. The bullet and the Road Runner are shown in slow time, with the bullet closing to within a half-body length of the bird. Then the Road Runner turns to notice the threat, lets out a beep and gears into super speed. The bullet then brakes in puzzlement and falls to the ground. Wile E. picks it up, and then it detonates.

Choices:  -- yes  -- it is not possible to tell  -- no","output":"Step 1: Understand the sentence provided and define its components. - \\"On its head, under the helmetphone and Busy Bee antennae\\" → This part of the sentence describes the location of the blond mop of hair. - \\"With an option for four antennas in the Blebletubby style\\" → This part of the sentence states that there is an option for the object (possibly the helmetphone or antennae) to have four antennas in a specific style. - \\"A blond mop of hair a la Dark Powder\\" → This part of the sentence describes the appearance of the hair. Step 2: Analyze the logical relation between the sentences and the question. The question asks: \\"Does it follow that \\"The blonde mop of hair has an option for four antennas.\\"?\\" We need to determine if the sentence structure and context suggest that the blonde mop of hair is indeed the subject that has an option for four antennas, or if it refers to another part of the object or entity. Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis. The phrase \\"with an option for four antennas in the Blebletubby style\\" seems to be more related to the helmetphone or Busy Bee antennae rather than the blond mop of hair. It does not explicitly connect the option for four antennas to the blond mop of hair. The sentence structure can be ambiguous, but the most plausible explanation is that the option for four antennas is related to the objects mentioned before.

The news about this is coming from a news channel called CNN.  You see, sometimes people do not get along, and there are bad people who take others by force. That's called an abduction. France, which is a country far away from Cameroon, thinks that a group of bad people from Nigeria might have done this. This group is called Boko Haram. Boko Haram is a scary group of people who have done lots of bad things to other people. They have been known to do many kidnappings, which is when someone is taken by force by a bad person and not allowed to go home. Now, some people are worried that this kidnapping might be Boko Haram's way of getting back at France for something France did in a country called Mali.

Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Given the question: Information:  - The archaeological record is the body of physical (not written) evidence about the past. It is one of the core concepts in archaeology, the academic discipline concerned with documenting and interpreting the archaeological record. Archaeological theory is used to interpret the archaeological record for a better understanding of human cultures. The archaeological record can consist of the earliest ancient findings as well as contemporary artifacts. Human activity has had a large impact on the archaeological record. Destructive human processes, such as agriculture and land development, may damage or destroy potential archaeological sites. Other threats to the archaeological record include natural phenomena and scavenging. Archaeology can be a destructive science for the finite resources of the archaeological record are lost to excavation. Therefore archaeologists limit the amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found. The archaeological record is the record of human history, of why civilizations prosper or fail and why cultures change and grow. It is the story of the world that humans have created.  - Uummannaq Fjord is a large fjord system in the northern part of western Greenland, the largest after Kangertittivaq fjord in eastern Greenland. It has a roughly south-east to west-north-west orientation, emptying into the Baffin Bay in the northwest.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard.

The bay is not navigable most of the year because of the ice cover and high density of floating ice and icebergs in the open areas. However, a polynya of about , known as the North Water, opens in summer on the north near Smith Sound. Most of the aquatic life of the bay is concentrated near that region. Extent. The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of Baffin Bay as follows: History. The area of the bay has been inhabited since  . Around  1200, the initial Dorset settlers were replaced by the Thule (the later Inuit) peoples. Recent excavations also suggest that the Norse colonization of the Americas reached the shores of Baffin Bay sometime between the 10th and 14th centuries. The English explorer John Davis was the first recorded European to enter the bay, arriving in 1585. In 1612, a group of English merchants formed the \\"Company of Merchants of London, Discoverers of the North-West Passage\\". Their governor Thomas Smythe organized five expeditions to explore the northern coasts of Canada in search of a maritime passage to the Far East. Henry Hudson and Thomas Button's explored Hudson Bay, William Gibbons Labrador, and Robert Bylot Hudson Strait and the area which became known as Baffin's Bay after his pilot William Baffin. Aboard the \\"Discovery\\", Baffin charted the area and named Lancaster, Smith, and Jones Sounds after members of his company. By the completion of his 1616 voyage, Baffin held out no hope of an ice-free passage and the area remained unexplored for another two centuries.

Information:  - A symphony is an extended musical composition in Western classical music, most often written by composers for orchestra. Although the term has had many meanings from its origins in the ancient Greek era, by the late 18th century the word had taken on the meaning common today: a work usually consisting of multiple distinct sections or movements, often four, with the first movement in sonata form. Symphonies are scored for string (violin, viola, cello and double bass), brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments which altogether number about 30100 musicians. Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts. Orchestral musicians play from parts which contain just the notated music for their instrument. A small number of symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., Beethoven's Ninth Symphony).  - Sound recording and reproduction is an electrical, mechanical, electronic, or digital inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog recording and digital recording.  - Chamber music is a form of classical music that is composed for a small group of instrumentstraditionally a group that could fit in a palace chamber or a large room. Most broadly, it includes any art music that is performed by a small number of performers, with one performer to a part (in contrast to orchestral music, in which each string part is played by a number of performers). However, by convention, it usually does not include solo instrument performances.  - (Franz) Joseph Haydn (31 March 173231 May 1809) was a prolific Austrian composer of the Classical period. He was instrumental in the development of chamber music such as the piano trio and his contributions to musical form have earned him the epithets \\"Father of the Symphony\\" and \\"Father of the String Quartet\\".  - A piano trio is a group of piano and two other instruments, usually a violin and a cello, or a piece of music written for such a group. It is one of the most common forms found in classical chamber music. The term can also refer to a group of musicians who regularly play this repertoire together; for a number of well-known piano trios, see below.  - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.  - Edison Records was one of the earliest record labels which pioneered sound recording and reproduction and was an important player in the early recording industry.  - The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the tenth edition of \\"The Oxford Companion to Music\\", Percy Scholes defines musical form as \\"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\\"  - The Haydn Quartet , later known as the Hayden Quartet , was one of the most popular recording close harmony quartets in the early twentieth century . It was originally formed in 1896 as the Edison Quartet to record for Edison Records ; it took its new name when recording for other companies . The name was a homage to Joseph Haydn , the classical composer ; the spelling was later revised to Hayden , which reflects the way it was pronounced . The group disbanded in 1914 .  - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'choir'. A:","output":"There is no specific entity mentioned in the given paragraphs that has a direct relation 'instance of' with 'choir'. However, it is mentioned that some symphonies contain vocal parts like Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. In this context, you could consider the vocal component or singers in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony as an entity related to a choir, since choirs consist of singers performing vocal music together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The hypothesis claims that women have always had this characteristic or behaved in this way. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to assess if the truth of the premise necessarily implies the truth of the hypothesis. In other words, given the information in the premise, must the hypothesis also be true? Step 4: Justification The premise provides information about the current state or behavior of women, but it does not provide any information about the past or how long they have been this way. Therefore, even if the premise is true (i.e., women are currently like that), it does not necessarily mean that they have always been like that.

Hypothesis: the two young players are lazy .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"To determine whether we can conclude the hypothesis that the two young players are lazy based on the premise that they are playing ice hockey, we need to evaluate the available information and explore any required assumptions or implicit considerations. First off, let's analyze the premise: \\"Two people are playing ice hockey.\\" Ice hockey is a physically demanding sport that requires players to exhibit a certain level of physical fitness, endurance, and skill. The game typically involves high-intensity, short intervals of active play. Participants need to skate, sometimes at high speeds, have good balance and hand-eye coordination, along with the ability to maintain focus throughout the duration of the game. Now, let's scrutinize the hypothesis: \\"the two young players are lazy\\" Lazy, in this context, can be interpreted as lacking the effort, determination, and drive to engage in activities that require physical or mental exertion. Lazy individuals may avoid or minimize their involvement in such activities to expend less effort. With the premise and hypothesis laid out, let's look at the correlation between playing ice hockey and being lazy. On the surface, engaging in a physically demanding sport such as ice hockey appears to be in direct contradiction with the characterization of the players as lazy. This is because the very act of playing requires the individuals to put forth physical effort, exhibit determination, and demonstrate a reasonable level of skills. However, we have limited information in the premise, as it only consists of a single statement about two people playing ice hockey. To conclusively determine whether the players are lazy, additional information is needed. For instance, are they playing ice hockey regularly, or was this just a one-time event? How well do they perform during the game, and do they exhibit a serious and committed attitude while playing? Assuming we only have the premise to work with, we cannot reasonably conclude that the hypothesis is true. Given the nature of ice hockey as a physically demanding sport, to label the players as lazy based on their participation in such activity would not be justified without further information or context. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"the two young players are lazy\\" is true. Additional information about the players' habits, attitude, and overall involvement in ice hockey or other activities would be necessary to make a more informed judgment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 1 states that birds evolved from a group of bipedal dinosaurs called theropods. This means that the theropods are the ancestors of modern-day birds, which encompass a wide variety of species, including hawks. Fact 2 states that all hawks are birds. Since hawks belong to the broader category of birds, they also share the same ancestry as other birds. This implies that hawks, being a member of the bird group, have evolved from the bipedal dinosaurs called theropods. Here is why the other choices are incorrect: a. Alpacas are mammals and not related to bipedal dinosaurs like theropods. Mammals and reptiles have separate evolutionary paths. b. Bacteria are single-celled organisms, which are considered distinct from the larger and more complex multicellular organisms such as theropods. Hence, bacteria are not evolved from theropods. d. Vision is a sense and not a living organism or species. It is not relevant to the discussion of evolutionary relationships between theropods and other organisms. e. Humans are mammals and belong to the group of primates. They share a common ancestor with other primates but not with the theropods, which are the ancestors of birds. f. Animals is a broad category that includes many different species, making this choice too vague for the specific information provided. Not every animal evolved from theropods. g. Mammals evolved from a separate group of ancient reptiles called synapsids, not from theropods. h. Viruses are not a living organism, but a collection of genetic material (RNA or DNA) that can replicate only inside living cells.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr.; April 16, 1947) is an American retired professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers. During his career as a center, Abdul-Jabbar was a record six-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), a record 19-time NBA All-Star, a 15-time All-NBA selection, and an 11-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. A member of six NBA championship teams as a player and two as an assistant coach, Abdul-Jabbar twice was voted NBA Finals MVP. In 1996, he was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. At age 24 in 1971, he converted to Islam and became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, which means \\"the noble one, servant of the Almighty.\\" He was named by Hamaas Abdul Khaalis. Abdul-Jabbar purchased and donated 7700 16th Street NW, a house in Washington, D.C. for Khaalis to use as the Hanafi Madh-Hab Center. Eventually, Kareem \\"found that [he] disagreed with some of Hamaas' teachings about the Quran, and [they] parted ways.\\"  Speaking about the thinking behind his change of name when he converted to Islam he stated that he was \\"latching on to something that was part of my heritage, because many of the slaves who were brought here were Muslims. My family was brought to America by a French planter named Alcindor, who came here from Trinidad in the 18th century. My people were Yoruba, and their culture survived slavery...  My father found out about that when I was a kid, and it gave me all I needed to know that, hey, I was somebody, even if nobody else knew about it. When I was a kid, no one would believe anything positive that you could say about black people. And that's a terrible burden on black people, because they don't have an accurate idea of their history, which has been either suppressed or distorted.\\"  In 1998, Abdul-Jabbar reached a settlement after suing Miami Dolphins running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar (now Abdul-Karim al-Jabbar, born Sharmon Shah) because he felt Karim was sponging off the name he made famous by having the Abdul-Jabbar moniker and number 33 on his Dolphins jersey. As a result, the younger Abdul-Jabbar had to change his jersey nameplate to simply \\"Abdul\\" while playing for the Dolphins. The football player had also been an athlete at UCLA.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly. Tom and Jerry catch up with the baby, only to lose it again, and fearing that it has crawled into a cement mixer on the 30th floor, the two dive straight in, only to find that the baby never did enter the mixer but instead playing with a hammer.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -976*x - 48 = -984*x for x.","output":"To solve the given equation -976*x - 48 = -984*x for the variable x, we must isolate x on one side of the equation by following these steps: 1. Add 976x to both sides of the equation. We do this to eliminate the -976x term on the left side of the equation to isolate the variable x on the right side: -976*x - 48 + 976x = -984*x + 976x (976x is the additive inverse of -976x, so they cancel each other out on the left side) This simplifies to: -48 = -8x 2. Next, we must divide both sides by -8, the coefficient of x in the current equation. (-48) / (-8) = (-8x) / (-8) -6 = x So, x = -6.

Answer: Before mechanical printing, literature was copied by hand, and many variations were introduced by copyists.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Step 1: Understand the question The user is asking about the reason for multiple variations in texts before the advent of the printing press. Step 2: Identify relevant information The key factors involved in this question are the multiple variations in texts and their existence before the invention of the printing press. Step 3: Formulate an answer Based on the information provided and the factors involved, we can infer that the variations in texts were due to the method of copying literature by hand. Step 4: Justify the answer The cause of these variations is in the manual copying process. When literature had to be copied by hand, human errors would inevitably occur, and the skill and precision of the copyist would play a significant role in the accuracy of the resulting copy. Each successive copy would introduce more variations, as copyists might make additional errors or attempt to correct previous errors in their copies. Moreover, copyists might also modify texts intentionally for various reasons, such as to update information, align with the prevailing ideology, or simply beautify the appearance of the manuscript. Step 5: Present the answer and check for user satisfaction Before mechanical printing, literature was copied by hand, and many variations were introduced by copyists.

Read this article and answer this question Hundreds of prisoners who had been captured with weapons in their hands or gunpowder on their hands had been shot immediately. Others were taken to the main barracks of the army in Paris and after summary trials, were executed there. They were buried in mass graves in parks and squares. Not all prisoners were shot immediately; the French Army officially recorded the capture of 43,522 prisoners during and immediately after Bloody Week. Of these, 1,054 were women, and 615 were under the age of 16. They were marched in groups of 150 or 200, escorted by cavalrymen, to Versailles or the Camp de Satory where they were held in extremely crowded and unsanitary conditions until they could be tried. More than half of the prisoners, 22,727 to be exact, were released before trial for extenuating circumstances or on humanitarian grounds. Since Paris had been officially under a state of siege during the Commune, the prisoners were tried by military tribunals. Trials were held for 15,895 prisoners, of whom 13,500 were found guilty. Ninety-five were sentenced to death; 251 to forced labour; 1,169 to deportation, usually to New Caledonia; 3,147 to simple deportation; 1,257 to solitary confinement; 1,305 to prison for more than a year; and 2,054 to prison for less than a year.

Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith).

Then he spots Rochefort on the street. In his haste to confront his enemy, D'Artagnan unintentionally insults three Musketeers: Athos (Paul Lukas), Porthos (Moroni Olsen), and Aramis (Onslow Stevens) in turn, agreeing each time to a duel.

Despite Manchester City's dominating performance, they were unable to find the back of Stoke City's net, which made Mame Biram Diouf's goal even more painful for the home fans. The 71st-minute strike was a thing of beauty, as Diouf dribbled past several City defenders before slotting the ball past goalkeeper Joe Hart. The match saw Manchester City create numerous chances, but they were continually denied by the heroic goalkeeping of Asmir Begovic, Stoke's last line of defense. The Bosnian shot-stopper made crucial saves throughout the game, notably from Samir Nasri, Yaya Toure, and Edin Dzeko. The late penalty incident occurred in the closing moments of the game when Yaya Toure seemed to be tripped in the box by Stoke's Erik Pieters. However, referee Lee Mason booked the Ivorian for simulation, adding more fuel to Manchester City's frustration. City fans and players alike were left bewildered, questioning Mason's decision not to award the penalty. After the game, when asked about the penalty incident, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini expressed his displeasure but chose not to make a big issue of it. He stated that the referee had an overall good game and preferred to focus on his team's inability to score despite creating numerous chances. This shows professionalism and maturity on Pellegrini's part, as he understands that these decisions are, unfortunately, a part of football and can sometimes go against one's team. With this result, Stoke City recorded their first league win of the 2014/15 season, while Manchester City suffered their first loss, a bitter pill to swallow for the reigning Premier League Champions. The game served as a reminder that no team in the Premier League can be taken for granted, and complacency can lead to unforeseen upsets.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Major League Context: Former Las Vegas showgirl Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitton) has inherited the Cleveland Indians baseball team from her deceased husband. Phelps has received a lucrative deal to move the team to Miami, and she aims to trigger the escape clause in the team's contract with Cleveland if season attendance falls below minimum levels. To do this, she replaces their existing players with aging veterans and inexperienced rookies, hoping a bad team will cause attendance to decline. Phelps hires Lou Brown, a former coach from the Toledo Mud Hens to manage the team. During spring training in Tucson, Brown and veteran catcher Jake Taylor discover the new team has a number of interpersonal issues as well as their own struggles with the game, such as the prima donna nature of Roger Dorn, the only player on a long-term contract with the Indians, and the weak arm of veteran pitcher Eddie Harris who is forced to doctor his pitches to stay competitive. The team starts the season on a losing streak. Their rookie pitcher, Ricky Vaughn, has an incredible fastball but with little control, leading him to be called \\"Wild Thing\\"; however, by chance, Brown discovers Vaughn has eyesight problems, and when they fit him with glasses, his pitching drastically improves, helping the Indians to a series of wins. The team rallies, bringing the Indians higher in the division standings. Phelps tries to demoralize the team by taking away their luxuries such as a private jet, but the team still holds strong, and appears to have a shot at winning the division. Meanwhile, Taylor finds that his ex-girlfriend Lynn is living in Cleveland, and tries to get her to come back to him even after learning she has become engaged to a new beau. When Phelps' original plan falls through, she decides that she will purposely void the contract, despite the financial penalty, and will move the team to Miami regardless. Donovan relays this to Brown, who informs the team that no matter how well they do, they will be fired after the season. The team succeeds in tying the... Answer:","output":"Roger Dorn's nature, as described in the movie \\"Major League,\\" can be termed as a struggle because he exhibits a prima donna attitude, which causes issues for the Cleveland Indians team as they try to work together to overcome their interpersonal struggles and improve their game. As the only player on a long-term contract, Dorn takes his position for granted and does not exhibit the same level of commitment, determination, or humility required for the team's success. This prima donna nature or struggle is a significant obstacle for the team to overcome throughout the movie. Roger Dorn's attitude and lack of teamwork hinder the efforts of the team's manager, Lou Brown, and its veteran catcher, Jake Taylor, to unite the players under one goal and create a winning season. Dorn's self-centered behavior contrasts sharply with that of his teammates, who demonstrate a willingness to adapt and change their ways for the betterment of the team. Dorn's struggle with his own nature becomes evident as the team starts to experience success. Despite the individual talents of the players, such as Ricky Vaughn's powerful fastball or Eddie Harris's experience, it becomes clear that their victories are only possible through collaboration and the development of a collective team identity. Dorn's prima donna nature acts as a stumbling block for the team, causing friction and highlighting the need for effective leadership to guide the players towards common goals. As the story unfolds, the importance of overcoming Dorn's struggle, both for himself and the team, comes into focus. The entire Cleveland Indians team faces challenges such as budget cuts imposed by Rachel Phelps and the prospect of being fired at the season's end. Regardless of these adversities, the team perseveres, steadily improving their standing in the division and ultimately reaching a shot at winning. To succeed, they must learn to set aside their personal issues and work together as a cohesive unit. In conclusion, Roger Dorn's prima donna nature is a significant struggle within the context of the movie \\"Major League.\\" The team's ability to overcome this struggle, along with others, serves as a central theme in their journey towards success. By acknowledging and confronting this issue, the Cleveland Indians are able to grow as a team, demonstrating the importance of unity, determination, and a collaborative spirit in the world of competitive sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: A Birmingham school at the centre of the \\"Trojan Horse\\" allegations has no religious extremism of any kind, says the chair of governors.","output":"Title: Birmingham School Clears Its Name Amid \\"Trojan Horse\\" Allegations Introduction: The \\"Trojan Horse\\" allegations have been an ongoing source of controversy in the United Kingdom's education sector, casting doubts over the safety and curriculum of schools in the Midlands. A school at the heart of these allegations in Birmingham has come forward to clear its name, with the chair of governors stating that there is no evidence of religious extremism of any kind at the institution. This article seeks to provide an overview of the \\"Trojan Horse\\" scandal, its impact on the school in question and the measures taken by the institution to address the accusations. Background of the \\"Trojan Horse\\" Allegations: The \\"Trojan Horse\\" scandal surfaced in 2013 when an anonymous letter was leaked, alleging a coordinated plot by Islamist groups to gain control of schools in Birmingham and implement a strict Islamic curriculum. The letter raised concerns that children were being subjected to radicalization and given an unbalanced education. The allegations were particularly sensitive given the growing concerns of radicalization and extremist activities in the United Kingdom. Investigations into the Allegations: Following the leak of the letter, a series of investigations were launched to determine the validity of the allegations. The key authorities involved in these investigations included Ofsted, the UK's education watchdog, and the Department of Education. Their findings indicated that there were, indeed, instances in which the schools in question contravened British values and promoted a particular religious ideology over others. However, it is important to note that the investigations were conflicting and controversial. Some of the investigations accused the schools of fostering radicalism while others concluded that there was no evidence to support such claims. The outcomes of these investigations led to public confusion, anger, and potential damage to the reputations of the schools involved. Birmingham School's Response to the Allegations: The chair of governors at the school at the centre of the \\"Trojan Horse\\" allegations has come forward to clear the school's name. The statement affirms that there is no evidence of religious extremism within the school, emphasizing its commitment to promoting diversity and tolerance. As part of its response to the allegations, the school has implemented a number of measures to address community concerns and uphold British values. These efforts include revising their curriculum to ensure that it aligns with national educational guidelines and promoting a balanced, diverse, and inclusive learning environment. The school has also taken measures to improve transparency by engaging with community leaders, parents, and government bodies. This open communication has helped to cultivate trust and foster a positive relationship between the school, families, and the wider community. Conclusion: The Birmingham school at the centre of the \\"Trojan Horse\\" allegations has proven its innocence by responding proactively to the concerns raised and demonstrating its commitment to upholding British values. While the investigations into the \\"Trojan Horse\\" scandal have uncovered some unfortunate instances of inappropriate educational practices, it is essential that the public recognizes the efforts made by schools like this one to provide a balanced, inclusive, and safe learning environment for all students. The \\"Trojan Horse\\" allegations have served as a catalyst for a broader conversation about the role of education in promoting diversity, tolerance, and social cohesion within our society. Whether or not the schools in question were engaged in extremist activities, the scandal has prompted a necessary reassessment of the education system in the United Kingdom. Ultimately, it is important to remain vigilant against any potential risks of radicalization within schools while also celebrating the success stories of institutions like this Birmingham school, which have demonstrated an unwavering dedication to nurturing the next generation of our diverse and inclusive society."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: A Republican tide ripped the Senate away from Democrats Tuesday, giving the GOP full control of Congress and the power to pin down President Barack Obama during his last two years in office. The thumping win upends the balance of power between the White House and Capitol Hill only six years after Obama's Democrats swept to power and marginalized Republicans in a rush to reform health care, Wall Street and pass a huge stimulus package. Now, it's Democrats who will take the back seat on Capitol Hill, relying mostly on the power of the filibuster to stymie Republicans and keep Obama's legacy intact. \\"For too long, this administration has tried to tell the American people what is good for them and then blame somebody else when their policies didn't work out,\\" Mitch McConnell, who is expected to become the next Senate majority leader, said in a victory speech. In the House, CNN projected the GOP will have at least 246 seats, its largest majority since World War II. Speaker John Boehner, celebrating a widened majority, said he is \\"humbled by the responsibility the American people have placed with us.\\" \\"But this is not a time for celebration,\\" he said. \\"It's time for government to start getting results and implementing solutions to the challenges facing our country, starting with our still-struggling economy. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who has controlled the Senate since 2007, congratulated Republicans on their victory. \\"The message from voters is clear: they want us to work together,\\" Reid said. \\"I look forward to working with Senator McConnell to get things done for the middle class.\\" Obama will make a statement Wednesday afternoon on an election many will see as a repudiation of his presidency, and he will host bipartisan leaders Friday to try to chart a way forward. GOP governors win blue states Maryland, Massachusetts, Illinois. Democratic losses pile up. Democratic fears of a rout came true, as party candidates struggled to defend seats won in the 2008 Obama wave in conservative territory, and couldn't get out from under an unpopular president limping through his second term. The losses in Colorado and Iowa will sting especially hard, as those two states enjoyed a fabled place in Obama's world, as drivers of the president's unlikely bid for the White House in 2008. The GOP also piled up wins in Montana, South Dakota, Arkansas, West Virginia and North Carolina — all seats that had been in Democratic hands — to surpass their magic number of six net gains. With seats still to be decided in Virginia, Alaska and Louisiana -- where there will be a runoff in December -- the GOP currently has 52 seats in the Senate. Republican numbers stood up when the GOP managed to hold on to seats in Kansas and Georgia which had threatened to fall from their grasp and complicate the Senate math. It was a night of almost unrelenting misery for Democrats:. • In Iowa, Iraq war veteran Joni Ernst became the first woman elected to Congress from her state, after turning around her Republican campaign with an ad in which she boasted about castrating hogs. • In North Carolina, Democrat Kay Hagan was felled by Thom Tillis, who repeatedly pummeled her for standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Obama. • Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor lost to Tom Cotton, who, like Ernst, is an Iraq war veteran. Pryor's loss comes despite former president Bill Clinton's efforts to save him in his beloved home state. • Democrats thought they had Colorado, with its mix of young voters, Hispanics and students locked down for a generation. But Sen. Mark Udall tumbled to charismatic challenger Cory Gardner who shook off claims he was anti-women. • Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner is having a tougher ride than expected against Republican challenger Ed Gillespie in a state Democrats had thought was reliably theirs after Obama won it twice. A rare ray of hope for Democrats came in New Hampshire, where Sen. Jeanne Shaheen bested challenger Scott Brown. And Pennsylvania's governor's mansion reverted to Democrats when Tom Wolf unseated Republican Gov. Tom Corbett in a marquee race. New superstars, new villains and other takeaways. Governors. Two other Republican governors meanwhile won reelection and stirred buzz for their own 2016 White House prospects — John Kasich in swing state Ohio, and conservative Republican Scott Walker in Wisconsin. In New Mexico, Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, often mentioned as a possible GOP vice presidential pick, strolled to reelection. Maryland -- a traditionally Democratic state -- elected Republican Larry Hogan as governor. And Illinois, Obama's home state, ousted its Democratic governor. Republicans will now look with some optimism on the 2016 presidential election. But Democrats will console themselves with a more favorable Senate map in two years' time and the belief that shifting demographics and an unresolved war between the Republican grassroots and the party establishment will make the next presidential race a tough climb for the GOP. View the full results. Highlights:","output":"- Republicans won the Senate, meaning they have control of Congress now. This makes it harder for President Obama to do what he wants in his last two years as President. - Democrats, who used to have control, will have to rely on a \\"filibuster\\" to try and stop the Republicans from doing things they don't like. - This new situation means the two parties will have to work together better if they want to get things done. - Some people think this election shows that many Americans are unhappy with President Obama, and that's why more Republicans won. - In the future, Republicans might have a better chance at winning the presidency, but Democrats are still hopeful too."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plot title: Monty Python's The Meaning of Life Movie plot: The film begins with a stand-alone 17-minute supporting feature entitled The Crimson Permanent Assurance (directed by Terry Gilliam). Set in London, England in present day 1983, a group of elderly office clerks in a small accounting firm rebel against their emotionlessly efficient, yuppie corporate masters. They commandeer their building, turn it into a pirate ship, and sail into a large financial district, where they raid and overthrow a large multinational corporation (before ultimately sailing to the edge of the earth and falling off).The film proper consists of a series of distinct sketches, broken into seven chapters.Part I: The Miracle of BirthA woman in labour is taken into a hospital delivery room, where she is largely ignored by doctors (John Cleese and Graham Chapman) and nurses, who are more concerned with using the hospital's most expensive equipment to impress the hospital's administrator (Michael Palin). The woman in labour notices that hospitals are changing, with \\"lots and lots of machinery\\".The Miracle of Birth Part II - The Third World In YorkshireA Roman Catholic man (Palin) loses his employment.

He will forever be in our hearts, a true inspiration who inspired many generations,\\" Cruelly, it was the actor's son, Jaycee Chan, who had to prove if the news was true, by making a phone call and finding him, fortunately, \\"busy as hell\\" organizing, with other Hong Kong celebrities, a charity concert on Friday to raise money for those struck down by the earthquake in Japan.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the subject of the painting that Hans Hieronymus Imhoff gave a lukewarm description for? is inside the article: After the painter's death in 1528, the portraits were held by his brother, and then his brother's widow before they passed into the collection of Willibald Imhoff, a grandson of Dürer's friend Willibald Pirckheimer. Inventories from the Imhoff collection from 1573–74, 1580 and 1588 list both panels. The next surviving Imhoff inventory, of 1628, again lists the mother's portrait, but it disappears after mention in the 1633–58 account books of Hans Hieronymus Imhoff, after which its whereabouts became unknown. Dürer expert Matthias Mende described the missing portrait of Barbara Holper as \\"among the most severe losses in the Dürer oeuvre\\". In 1977, art historian Lotte Brand Philip proposed that Unknown Woman in a Coif, held by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, was the original portrait of Barbara Holper. The Nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of Wolgemut's workshop, a Franconian artist in his circle, or the anonymous Mainz painter Master W. B. Brand Philip's attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone, theme and size with the father panel at the Uffizi. In both works the sitters are holding rosary beads, and Dürer attentively describes their hands. Both portraits show the sitter in the same pose, against a similarly coloured background. Both are lit from the upper left. The boards are identically cut in width and depth, although 3 cm was removed from the left edge of Barbara's panel. Brand Philip noted the similarities between the panel and Dürer's 1514 charcoal drawing Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63. Fedja Anzelewsky agreed with the attribution, noting that both portraits bear, on their reverse, the catalogue number recorded in the Imhoff inventories, as well as \\"precisely the same design of masses of dark clouds\\".Anzelewsky speculated that the father's portrait, which was not listed in the 1628 Imhoff inventory, had been broken off and sold to Rudolph II of Austria. Hans Hieronymus Imhoff's lukewarm..., can you guess it ?

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. By Olivia Fleming PUBLISHED: 16:41 EST, 12 July 2012 | UPDATED: 10:00 EST, 13 July 2012 A group of teenage girls staged a protest outside Teen Vogue's offices on Wednesday, asking the fashion magazine to publicly commit to using 'Photoshop-free, diverse images of real girls.' Holding signs and walking arm-in-arm, Carina Cruz and Emma Stydahar of the girl-fueled Spark Movement, staged a mock runway show in the middle of Times Square in an effort to give the editors, and the world, an idea of what real girls look like. The girls were allowed to meet with Teen Vogue editors, where they handed over a petition with more than 20,000 signatures, however the teenagers told Jezebel the magazine's reaction was not what they were expecting. After she delivered a petition with 25,000 signatures to ban","output":"the use of Photoshop and encourage diversity in Teen Vogue, Carina Cruz shared that the magazine's editors seemed unresponsive to their concerns. Although they thanked the girls for their input, there was no immediate commitment made to change their editorial policies or practices. Despite the protestors' disappointment, the campaign gained significant attention on social media, with many users expressing support for the cause and calling for industry-wide change. In response to the growing public pressure, Teen Vogue eventually issued a statement asserting their commitment to promoting a healthy body image and featuring diverse models in their magazine. While the statement did not explicitly ban the use of Photoshop, it did mention ongoing efforts to showcase a wide range of beauty ideals and ensure that editorial content reflects the diverse readership of Teen Vogue. The Spark Movement continued to advocate for Photoshop-free and diverse representation in the media, calling on other fashion magazines to follow Teen Vogue's lead. As public awareness and pressure mounted, more publications began to embrace inclusivity and limit digital alteration in their own images. This shift in the industry ultimately led to a noticeable increase in the representation of various body types, ethnicities, and personal styles in fashion and beauty media. In the years following the protest, media outlets, including Teen Vogue, continued to face scrutiny over their portrayal of beauty standards. While significant strides have been made to improve diversity and promote a healthier body image, activists argue that more work is needed to ensure equal and accurate representation in the fashion and beauty industries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -176*m = -6934 + 246 for m.","output":"To find the solution for the given equation -176*m = -6934 + 246, we will isolate the variable m. Here are the step-by-step instructions to solve the equation: Step 1: Simplify both sides of the equation. -1. On the left side of the equation, we have -176*m, which is already simplified. -2. On the right side of the equation, we have -6934 + 246. Add these two numbers together: -6934 + 246 = -6688. The simplified equation is now -176*m = -6688. Step 2: Isolate the variable m. To isolate the variable m, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -176. -176*m / -176 = -6688 / -176 Remember that when you divide two numbers with the same sign (negative in this case), the result will be positive. Step 3: Calculate the value of m. Now we need to divide -6688 by -176 to find the value of m. -6688 / -176 = 38 Step 4: Write the solution.

So we didn't move. We just stood there and laughed in embarrassment. Finally, one student, a thin, quiet, dark-haired girl called Sarah, decided to move. She crossed her arms in front of her body, closed her eyes, and slowly fell backwards. She looked quiet but brave. For a moment, I was sure that she was going to fall on the floor.

Unable to recall the actual occurrences due to a forced mental block, she seeks the help of a psychiatrist in overcoming her insomnia. After numerous visits and hypnosis, Allison's psychiatrist advises her that she is a survivor of a massacre which occurred at a camp over a decade ago. Her disbelief for the whole situation inclines her doctor to advise her to return to the site for an afternoon, in hopes that if she were to see the scenes of the crimes, she would remember them and overcome them. Doubtful, Allison sets out for the camp she attended but never remembered. When she reaches her destination, she finds the camp to be closed and abandoned, the land now Federal Property. She remininces about the events that occurred in the original trilogy. Allison narrates over many of these scenes. Archive footage from the first three film are organised into themes, such as Angela being afraid of water. Allison looks for the ranger, Jack (John Lodicos), that her psychologist, Dr. Lewis, advised her to meet up with.

On the one hand, his revolutionary process for creating synthetic fertilizers averted the greatest overpopulation crisis the world has ever known, won him the Nobel Prize in 1918, and now feeds over 2 billion people. But Haber was also a staunch German patriot who loved his country with an almost blinding loyalty. Born and raised Jewish, his longing to be accepted as a true German and his intense ambition in his career led him to convert to Lutheranism and abandon his faith. When World War I broke out, the bloody stalemate of trench warfare threatened to slaughter an entire generation of young Germans, and the German military requested Haber to use his genius to create a new kind of weapon that could break the deadlock. As Haber agonized over the decision, his wife, Clara, a chemist herself who had sacrificed her own career to support his, implored him not to go through with it. But Haber, his opportunity to become a true German hero finally at hand, agreed to help the militaryâand became the father of modern chemical warfare.

It is tougher, and less reasoned, than Martin Amis's recent short story 'The Last Days of Muhammad Atta.'

Earlier reports suggested the existence of a mystery investor, and now the company has finally confirmed the involvement of Coatue Management, effectively quelling the speculations. Although Snapchat has revealed the identity of the investor, they have declined to provide any further comments on the matter.  This recent turn of events is particularly remarkable, as Snapchat's valuation has doubled since June of this year, reaching an astounding 2 billion. It appears that the messaging app is growing in popularity, both among users and potential investors. The market response to Snapchat's features, which allow users to share photos and videos that disappear after a few seconds, highlights the demand for unique and innovative communication platforms in today's digital landscape. The news of Snapchat's latest funding round comes on the heels of numerous rumours about the growing interest of tech giants, such as Facebook, in acquiring the company. According to multiple sources, Facebook made an offer to purchase Snapchat for a massive 3 billion, but the deal was turned down. Surprisingly, this is not the first time that the social media giant has expressed interest in acquiring the messaging app company, as reports indicate that Snapchat has previously rejected another offer from Facebook. While the reasons behind the rejections remain elusive, it's quite evident that Snapchat's management sees great potential in its current trajectory and overall growth prospects. The company could be seeking to solidify its competitive advantage and market leadership before considering any partnerships or acquisitions by major players in the tech industry.  Moreover, the involvement of Coatue Management in Snapchat's funding round may serve as a catalyst for other investors to express their interest and support for the messaging app's ongoing success. Coatue Management, with its track record of making profitable investments in the technology and media sectors, has made a significant bet on the future growth of Snapchat. This, in turn, may encourage other prominent investors to take notice of the company's potential. In conclusion, Snapchat's recent 50 million funding round, led by Coatue Management, underlines the firm's rapid growth and resilience amidst ongoing competition in the messaging app market. Despite the tempting acquisition offers from tech giants like Facebook, Snapchat remains focused on its business strategy and retaining its independence. As the company's valuation continues to soar, it will be intriguing to see how Snapchat continues to evolve and maintain its position as a leading player in the digital communication sector."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He decided to take advantage of this newfound comfort to strike up a conversation with both of them and get to know them better, hoping to deepen their connection and forge stronger bonds among the three of them. He began by inquiring about their individual interests and hobbies. Sal, as it turns out, was passionate about photography and had an eye for capturing the perfect moments, be it a breathtaking landscape or an intimate candid shot. It was easy to see that this creative outlet was an essential aspect of Sal's life by the way he spoke about it. He even carried his camera with him wherever he went, and his portfolio was filled with an incredible array of shots that told countless stories. On the other hand, Ali's interest revolved around literature and writing. She had a vast collection of books, encompassing various genres and authors. Her favorites were the classics, which had the ability to transport her back to the periods and locations they were set in, and she could often be found curled up on her armchair, lost between the pages of a good book, oblivious to her surroundings. Ali also enjoyed writing her own short stories and poems, some of which were published in local magazines and received positive reception, further fueling her passion for the craft. As the conversation flowed and they delved deeper, they found other common interests among themselves, such as music, traveling, and a shared love for good food. They reminisced about their favorite concerts, the beautiful places they wished to visit someday, and culinary adventures they had embarked upon. He felt that under different circumstances, they might have been great friends, even without the laughter that had brought them closer. However, he couldn't quite shake off the gravity of the situation they were in, with the recent drugged experiences they'd had. It was a dark cloud that still loomed in the back of their minds, threatening to overshadow their bright conversation. Though subtle, he sensed that Sal and Ali were glad for the camaraderie that had blossomed in such a short amount of time. Their shared experiences had, in a way, forged a unique bond that also acted as a coping mechanism – helping them process the trauma and heal together. Seeing both Sal and Ali opening up to each other and him, he felt a growing determination to help them overcome their past experiences and forge a path toward healing. As they continued to laugh, chat, and share their stories, the dynamic among the three developed into a strong and supportive connection. He realized that sometimes, amidst adversity, laughter could indeed be the best medicine. It not only cleared the tension but also offered them an anchor – a sense of hope and understanding in a world that seemed to be spiraling out of control. It brought them back to their humanity, reminding them of the joy they were capable of experiencing, despite the dark times they had endured. And as they continued walking down this newfound path, hand in hand, they began to rebuild and rediscover the strength within themselves, drawing upon the power of friendship and the healing nature of laughter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: While surfing television channels over the weekend,a scene from a family classic of last year portraying the now-so-familiar sorry state of retired parents being ill-treated by their children and families caught my attention. I wondered why the description of this relationship had not changed much over the many years! Even though the same movies and soaps accurately capture several other social changes around us -- from value systems to new found economic freedom to the importance of technology and the changing approach to consumerism   -- are these creative efforts far from the truth in telling us that an average retiree is still struggling?  Look around and you will agree that the post-retired lifestyle for an ex-salaried class people is often a pale shadow of their last working years. Even self employed people, who have handed over the responsibility to the next generation, are no exception. Did the average middle class not save enough through his working years?  Socially, we already know that the Indians are taught the benefits of start saving early on in life. Household savings data supports this social behavior -- India has the highest rates of savings among various economies and is far ahead of the west.

Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl in 1978. Director lives in exile in France after fleeing the United States. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: 31-Year-Old Sex Offense Case Against Roman Polanski Faces Motion to Dismiss Introduction: Renowned film director Roman Polanski may soon find closure on a dark chapter in his life, as a motion has been filed to dismiss the longstanding sex offense case against him. The case dates back to 1978 when Polanski pleaded guilty to engaging in unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl. The director has since been living in exile in France, after fleeing the United States to avoid sentencing. (Step 1: Provide context on the history of the case and Roman Polanski's legal situation.) In 1977, Roman Polanski was originally charged with multiple counts relating to the sexual assault of a minor, including rape by use of drugs, perversion, and sodomy. However, in a plea bargain, he later pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of unlawful sexual intercourse in exchange for the dismissal of the other charges. Although Polanski underwent a psychiatric evaluation and had spent 42 days in prison, he fled the United States before his final sentencing as he feared that the judge would disregard the plea bargain, sending him back to prison for an extended period. (Step 2: Explain why a motion has been filed to dismiss the case now and the legal justification.) The motion to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski has been filed in light of new evidence and statements from the victim, Samantha Geimer, who has publicly asked for the case to be dropped multiple times. Additionally, legal experts argue that much time has elapsed since the original incident, further complicating the case. As a result, the court may consider both the victim's wishes and the difficulties of prosecuting such an old case when determining whether or not to proceed with the charges. (Step 3: Discuss the potential consequences of the case being dismissed for Polanski and the legal system.) If the court honors the motion to dismiss the charges against Roman Polanski, it would bring closure to a 31-year-old legal battle. However, the decision may also prompt debate surrounding the legal system's handling of high-profile criminal cases and its ability to effectively address sex crimes, particularly those involving minors. Consequently, the outcome of this case will likely have ramifications that extend beyond Polanski's personal situation. (Step 4: Address the implications that the outcome of the case might have on the broader public.) The resolution of Roman Polanski's sex offense case could impact the public's perception of justice and the legal system, particularly where high-profile individuals are concerned. Should the charges be dismissed, some may argue that Polanski's fame and resources allowed him to evade justice for more than three decades. Alternatively, others may view the potential dismissal as a demonstration of the legal system recognizing the limitations and difficulties of prosecuting historic cases. Conclusion: As the motion to dismiss the sex offense case against Roman Polanski awaits consideration by the courts, the world looks on with anticipation. The outcome of this case not only has the potential to directly impact Polanski's life but also carries significant implications for the legal system, the handling of sex crimes, and public perception of justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They convey the same information with slightly different wording and sentence structure. In both sentences, the key pieces of information include the manufacturing of naval propellants at ROF Bishopton and the filling of these propellants at ROF Chorley and later at ROF Glascoed. The main difference between the sentences is the order in which they present the information. In the first sentence, the order of the information is: manufacturing at ROF Bishopton, filling at ROF Chorley, and later filling at ROF Glascoed. The sentence uses the terms \\"manufactured\\" and \\"filled\\" as verbs to describe the process. In the second sentence, the order of information is the same, but it rearranges the sentence structure slightly by using the word \\"then\\" to indicate the sequence of events.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid      WASHINGTON Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said on Thursday it has a \\"reasonable basis\\" to believe Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) massive data breach of email accounts represents a material impact that could allow Verizon to withdraw from its 4.83 billion deal to buy the technology company.      Verizon's general counsel Craig Silliman told reporters at a roundtable in Washington the data breach could trigger a clause in the deal that would allow the U.S. wireless company not to complete it.      \\"I think we have a reasonable basis to believe right now that the impact is material and we're looking to Yahoo to demonstrate to us the full impact. If they believe that it's not then they'll need to show us that,\\" he said, declining to comment on whether talks are under way to renegotiate the purchase price.      Asked for comment, a Yahoo spokesman said: \\"We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.\\"      The deal has a clause that says Verizon can withdraw if a new event \\"reasonably can be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, properties, results of operation or financial condition of the business.”      Silliman said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has approved Verizon's planned acquisition of Yahoo, but it still needs approval from the European Commission and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the proxy.      Verizon has had preliminary briefings from Yahoo but it still needs \\"significant information\\" from the company before it makes a final decision on the materiality of the hacking of at least 500 million email accounts, Silliman said.      He said Verizon is \\"absolutely evaluating (the breach) and will make determinations about whether and how to move forward with the deal based on our evaluation of the materiality.\\"      Yahoo shares ended 1.75 percent lower at 41.62, while Verizon was largely unchanged, closing at 50.29, down 0.02 percent.      Yahoo in September disclosed that it had fallen victim to a data breach in 2014 that compromised users’ names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords.      The company has said the cyber attack was carried out by a “state-sponsored” actor, but some private security experts have challenged that assertion.      Several Democratic senators have pressed Yahoo to reveal more information about the hack and why it took so long to discover.      The internet firm said it learned of the breach this summer while investigating claims of a separate intrusion, but it has not provided a specific timeline of events.      Some analysts suggested Verizon may be trying to get a better price.      Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, said \\"Verizon is rightfully upset about Yahoo not properly disclosing the breach.\\"      He said Yahoo would most likely have to consider renegotiating the price with Verizon, if it came to that.      \\"I don't think it has much of a choice. Who else would want to buy them?\\" Entner said.      Experts said bidders who try to extract themselves from mergers using the material adverse clause face an uphill battle. No U.S. company has ever invoked the clause successfully in court to get out of a deal.      In 2013, Cooper Tire & Rubber company got cold feet about a 2.5 billion sale to Apollo Tyres and argued in the Delaware Court of Chancery that Apollo had seen a material adverse change related to union issues at a subsidiary of the company. The court rejected Cooper Tire’s claims and the deal fell apart.      A Delaware court ruled in 2001 that poultry producer Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) could not terminate its merger with beef producer IBP Inc over accounting irregularities. The court said the shortfall was not due to a long-term problem.

Craig Silliman, Verizon's general counsel, told reporters on Thursday that the company has \\"a reasonable basis\\" to suspect that Yahoo's (YHOO, Tech30) massive security breach could have a meaningful financial impact on the deal, according to multiple reports.      \\"We're looking to Yahoo to demonstrate to us the full impact if they believe it's not. They'll need to show us that, but the process is in the works,\\" Silliman said, according to The Washington Post.      Robert Varettoni, a spokesman for Verizon (VZ, Tech30), confirmed the statements, but declined to comment beyond it.      The comments suggest Verizon could look to renegotiate the deal price or back out of the 4.8 billion deal altogether. Yahoo's stock dipped after Silliman's remarks and was down nearly 2% in late trading Thursday.      Yahoo confirmed last month that data \\"associated with at least 500 million user accounts\\" had been stolen in one of the largest cybersecurity breaches ever.      Related: Verizon only just learned about Yahoo's massive data breach      Verizon, which agreed to buy Yahoo's core properties for 4.83 billion in July, said it had only learned of the breach two days before Yahoo disclosed it to the public.      At a conference earlier this week, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam denied rumors that Verizon could demand a significantly lower price tag for buying Yahoo as a result of the breach.      \\"That is just total speculation. We still see a real value to the asset there,\\" McAdam said, according to CNBC. \\"But in fairness, we're still understanding what was going on, to define whether it's a material impact to the business or not.\\"      When the breach was first reported, some analysts told CNNMoney that it could shave off as much as 200 million from the deal price.      \\"It comes down to whether or not there is a meaningful change in use of the platform above and beyond what was happening before,\\" Brian Wieser, an analyst who covers Yahoo at Pivotal Research Group, said at the time.      The Yahoo acquisition was originally expected to close in the first quarter of 2017. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Verizon's general counsel, Craig Silliman, said that Yahoo's recent massive data breach could allow Verizon to pull out of its 4.83bn deal to buy the technology company.

Bats, being living organisms on Earth, play no role in these celestial processes.

Bats are crucial for maintaining balance in ecosystems as they pollinate plants, disperse seeds, and control insect populations. Their disappearance could lead to an increase in insects that are detrimental to agriculture, which could, in turn, affect plant populations and the overall health of ecosystems.

Motorola followed soon after, and signed with Sisvel to license MP3-related patents in December 2005. Except for three patents, the US patents administered by Sisvel had all expired in 2015, however (the exceptions are: U.S. Patent 5,878,080, expires February 2017, U.S. Patent 5,850,456, expires February 2017 and U.S. Patent 5,960,037, expires 9. April 2017. What did Sisvel grant Thomson to end the lawsuit?","output":"The lawsuit between Sisvel S.p.A, its U.S. subsidiary Audio MPEG, Inc., and Thomson was regarding patent infringement on MP3 technology. The disputes were settled in November 2005 when Sisvel decided to grant Thomson a license to their patents. This means that Sisvel provided Thomson with a legal permission or authorization to use their patented technology.  Patent licensing is a common way to resolve tech-related lawsuits in the business world. It involves the owner of the patent, in this case Sisvel and Audio MPEG, allowing a third party, in this case Thomson, to use, make, sell, or import their invention within a certain territory for a specified period, in return for an agreed payment structure. In simple terms, through this license, the owner of the patent grants rights of their invention to the licensee, which means that the licensee is then free to use the invention without the possibility of infringement on the patent holder's rights.  The grant of this patent license ended the lawsuit for patent infringement with Thomson. It allowed Thomson to legally use the patented MP3 technology of Sisvel and Audio MPEG without fear of further legal repercussion.  It's noteworthy that following this, Motorola also opted for a similar approach and signed with Sisvel to license MP3-related patents in December 2005. However, except for three mentioned patents, all other US patents administered by Sisvel expired in 2015, with the exceptions being U.S. Patent 5,878,080, U.S. Patent 5,850,456 and U.S. Patent 5,960,037 which expired in February 2017 and April 2017 respectively.

Joe Manchin said Sunday he’s not finished with his effort to expand background checks for gun buyers, despite the proposal’s defeat and other key senators appearing to now move beyond the issue.      Manchin told “Fox News Sunday” that he’s going to rework the proposal to get it back to the Senate floor.      ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT      \\"I believe that with all of my heart, and we're going to work this bill,” he told Fox News.      Manchin was joined by Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey in crafting the background check proposal, in part to get bipartisan support for the largely Democratic gun-control plan, following a mass shooting in December 2012 in which 20 first-graders were killed.      However, the proposal to expand the check to online sales and gun shows was shelved earlier this month when it got just 54 of the required 60 Senate votes.      On Friday, Toomey said he had no plans to revive the proposal.      \\"My own view is very simple: The Senate has had its vote. We've seen the outcome of that vote. I am not aware of any reason to believe that if we had the vote again that we'd have a different outcome,\\" he said, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.      Manchin told Fox: “I don’t think he’s done.”      He also said he has spoken with fellow gun owners who appear to support legislation that would keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the severe mentally ill.      Manchin said “law-abiding citizens” support background checks, and he urged Americans to read the proposal, then tell him what parts they don’t like.      Senate Majority Harry Reid said days after the defeat of the Manchin-Toomey proposal that he has “hit pause” on efforts to pass comprehensive gun-control legislation.

He is the mutant son of Professor Charles Xavier and Gabrielle Haller. Legion takes the role of an antihero who has a severe mental illness including a form of dissociative identity disorder, in which each of his alternate personas controls one of his many superpowers. The television series Legion premiered on FX network in 2017. When Mystique tracked down David years later to get revenge for \\"his\\" murder of Destiny, he awakened with his fractured mind healed. David had a new goal, to help his father realize his dream of human-mutant coexistence by killing Magneto, Xavier's greatest opponent, before he had a chance to amass power. He traveled twenty years into the past, when Xavier and Magneto were orderlies at the mental hospital. In the process, he loses his memory. Magneto then accidentally triggers his memory, causing David to go on a rampage, attacking Magneto and revealing the existence of mutants to the public decades too early. Several X-Men who were pulled back in time with him were unable to prevent him from attacking Magneto. Xavier, however, leaped into the path of the psi-knife (the focused totality of Legion's psionic powers) and was killed in Magneto's place, causing the formation of the Age of Apocalypse timeline.  Due to being trapped in the past by David's actions, Bishop enlisted the aid of the new reality's X-Men to travel back in time to confront Legion again. Bishop seized Legion's psi-blade and drove it into his own chest, allowing Legion to see the future that he caused. In his last moments, David apologized for what he did. David's mother, Gabrielle Haller, described having a \\"maternal loss\\" afterward, implying she miscarried before giving birth to David.  While David was considered deceased, some of his alternate personalities remained trapped between life and death, manifesting as spirits. When the spirits started terrorizing Israel, Excalibur was called to stop them. After learning that the spirits were refusing death, Meggan used her empathy to calm their rage, convincing them to go \\"towards the light.\\" Who was Magneto?","output":"Magneto is another character in the Marvel comics, just like Legion. He's very powerful and can control anything made of metal, which is a pretty neat trick, right? His real name is Erik Lehnsherr.  Something interesting about Magneto is that he wasn't always a bad guy. He and Professor Xavier, who is Legion's dad, used to be friends. Both of them are mutants, which means they were born with special powers. But they see the world in very different ways. Professor Xavier dreams of a peaceful world where mutants and regular humans can live together happily. But, Magneto thinks that mutants are better than regular humans and often tries to fight against them, that's why he is usually seen as the villain.  In the story you mentioned, Magneto and Xavier are working together at the same hospital. Legion (David) tries to protect his dad's dream by getting rid of Magneto. It's not very nice, but he thinks it might help make the world a better place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who did Fluffy protect?  The story opens with Lazlo missing, and Clam and Raj relating the tale up to this point. The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear.  When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect. The next series of scenes deal with both Edward spinning a web of lies, and Lumpus trying to come to grips with Lazlo's disappearance, but only due to his fear of Commander Hoo-Ha, not over any concern for the missing scouts.

Article: On a warm Monday, Jenny Neilson bought a sandwich and parked her car under some trees. Rolling down the windows to let in fresh air, she settled back to enjoy her lunch. Suddenly she noticed a big  _ man running through the parking lot. Before she came to realize what would happen, the man was there, shouting through her window, \\"Get out!\\"  Neilson refused. Pulling open her door, the man seized her by the neck and hair, and threw her out of the car onto the ground. She screamed, grabbing her purse and the keys. Two reporters of the local newspaper, Robert Bruce and Jeff Jackson, just outside their office building on a break, heard the screams and began running . When they reached Neilson's car, the attacker had jumped into the driver's seat and was madly searching for the keys. Bruce opened the door, and he and Jackson dragged the man out. The attacker fought back. But even in his cornered panic, he was no match for the two athletic men. Reggie Miller, a worker of the local newspaper, heard the screams, too. He rushed back to the office to phone the police, and then ran back with some plastic ropes ---- used to tie up newspapers. With his arms tied tight behind him, the prisoner looked up and said coldly, \\"I hope you guys feel good about yourselves---- you just caught one of the most wanted men.\\" They ignored him and waited for the police. Later, Bruce and Jackson were shocked to learn the man was the professional carjacker  and suspected murderer, whose picture---- but with a full head of hair---- had been recently printed in their own newspaper.

This is a correct answer to the following question about Cutter (baseball). Yes or no? Answer: When a batter is able to hit a cutter pitch, it often results in soft contact and an easy out, due to the pitch's movement keeping the ball away from the bat's sweet spot . Question: what does a cutter do The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, a cutter (short for cut fastball) is a type of baseball pitch designed to have more lateral movement than a typical fastball. It is thrown with a slightly off-center grip and slightly altered release, which imparts a spin to the ball that causes it to break or \\"cut\\" in towards a right-handed batter if thrown by a right-handed pitcher, or away from a right-handed batter if thrown by a left-handed pitcher. This pitch is particularly effective because it maintains a relatively high velocity, similar to a fastball, while still having enough movement to make it difficult for batters to hit solidly. When a hitter makes contact with a cutter, the lateral movement of the pitch often causes the ball to miss the sweet spot of the bat. The sweet spot, also known as the center of percussion, is the point on the bat where contact with the ball results in the least amount of vibration and the greatest transfer of energy, resulting in a more powerful hit. If a pitch misses the sweet spot, the result is often weaker contact, more vibrations, and reduced energy transfer, which can lead to a poorer quality hit and potentially an easy out for the defense. A well-executed cutter is highly effective in achieving soft contact, as it can fool hitters by appearing to be a standard fastball until the very last moment when it breaks sharply. Often, even when the hitter is expecting the pitch, they may struggle to make solid contact due to the late and deceiving movement. This effectiveness of a cutter is the reason why many pitchers, especially those in Major League Baseball, have adopted this pitch as one of their primary weapons. Legendary pitchers like Mariano Rivera and Kenley Jansen have built successful careers around the cutter, making it a key element in their pitching repertoire. When thrown properly, a cutter pitch can minimize the chances of batters making solid contact and increase the chances of getting easy outs, making it a valuable tool for any pitcher at all levels of baseball."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who do the townspeople hold as heros? Movie title: Wild Hogs Movie plot: Doug Madsen (Tim Allen), Woody Stevens (John Travolta), Bobby Davis (Martin Lawrence), and Dudley Frank (William H. Macy) are four middle-aged suburban men living in a Cincinnati area suburb who find themselves frustrated with the pace of daily life and lack of adventure. Doug is a dentist who has trouble relating to his son Billy (Dominic Janes), Dudley is a single clumsy computer programmer who is afraid to talk to women. Bobby is a henpecked plumber whose wife has made him return to work after having taken a year off to unsuccessfully write a book, and Woody is a rich lawyer married to a supermodel. They find escape from their daily routines on weekends by riding motorcycles together posing as a biker gang called the \\"Wild Hogs\\". One day, when Woody finds out his wife is divorcing him and leaving him bankrupt, he and his friends go on a road trip on their bikes to California. After encountering several misadventures, they end up at a local bar, where they meet a much larger biker gang called the Del Fuegos, headed by Jack Blade (Ray Liotta). Jack calls the Wild Hogs \\"posers\\" and has his gang take Dudley's bike after a bogus deal to exchange Dudley's bike for a new bike that is in fact old and derelict, forcing the men to leave with Dudley in a sidecar attached to Woody's bike. Outraged at their actions, Woody returns to the Del Fuegos bar and retrieves Dudley's bike, cuts off their bikes' fuel supplies in the process and fabricates a story to the other Wild Hogs of how he \\"negotiated\\" with them to return the bike. When the Del Fuegos hear the Wild Hogs riding back past the bar, they attempt to pursue them, only for the bikes to stall. Jack inadvertently drops his lit cigarette onto the ground, igniting the fuel leaking from the bikes which then causes the the bar to explode. Woody, after witnessing the explosion from afar, convinces the others to keep riding. Eventually, the Wild Hogs run out of gas and end up in Madrid, New Mexico, where they stumble into a diner and help themselves to water and beer... A:","output":"In the movie \\"Wild Hogs\\", the townspeople of Madrid, New Mexico, would likely hold the Wild Hogs (Doug, Woody, Bobby, and Dudley) as heroes. The reason for this is that they stand up against the Del Fuegos, a larger biker gang who are portrayed as the antagonists in the story. The Wild Hogs not only help to retrieve Dudley's bike after the Del Fuegos take it unfairly, but they also, although inadvertently, cause the Del Fuegos' bar to explode. This is likely seen as a way of challenging the Del Fuegos, a dominant force in the town. By standing up to the Del Fuegos and asserting themselves as a united group, the Wild Hogs would be seen as heroes by the townspeople, who may have suffered under the Del Fuegos' influence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This description includes the use of optical sensors, magnetic sensors, and other technological components that enable accurate identification and validation of the inserted banknotes. In general, most vending machines employ the following techniques for banknote identification: 1. Optical sensors: Vending machines are equipped with optical sensors that can detect the complex patterns, watermarks, and other unique features present on each banknote. Some vending machines may use infrared or ultraviolet light to detect specific security features that are not visible to the naked eye. 2. Magnetic sensors: Banknotes contain magnetic ink traces and patterns that are used as safety features to prevent counterfeiting. Vending machines utilize magnetic sensors to detect the magnetic information on the inserted bill. These sensors assess the magnetic ink's strength and direction to determine if the banknote is genuine and of the correct denomination. 3. Size and thickness: Vending machines also measure the size and thickness of the entered banknotes. Each denomination has varied dimensions that, when assessed, help the machine confirm the validity of the bill. 4. Mechanical features: Most bills include mechanical features like paper texture and specific cuts that can be checked by vending machines to authenticate the bills. 5. Software algorithms: Modern vending machines use sophisticated software programs containing algorithms to analyze and compare the collected data from sensors to the database of authentic banknotes. That helps them match the input with the correct denomination and confirm its validity. In the case of currency updates or new banknote releases, these programs can be easily updated to support the latest currency designs and security features. By employing a combination of these techniques, vending machines can accurately differentiate between various denominations, such as 1 and 5 bills, ensuring that the correct amount is credited to the user."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

When I was writing the manuscript for Florentine, I enlisted the help of an army of recipe testers — about 80 people from all over the world — to test every recipe thoroughly. Only one came back to me consistently with problems. From Minnesota to Melbourne, three testers wrote to me that their very first attempt at making Tuscan gnudi (ricotta and spinach balls that, rather than be encased in pasta like for ravioli, are simply dusted in flour) resulted in a pot of simmering water with “dissolved” gnudi. It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi’s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared – O dove’erano andati? “Where did they go?” In the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors — was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use “proper” ricotta? Aha. “Proper” ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives.

Orton Sr., the Times Square street vendor who saw something and said something on Saturday night, had a lot on his mind as he spoke with reporters on Tuesday. There was the phone call from President Obama earlier in the morning thanking him for alerting the police to the smoking Nissan Pathfinder – “It wasn’t the press secretary; it was the president himself.” There was his take on being called a hero – “I’m just an average guy.” And there was his reaction to the news that the authorities had made an arrest: “If this is the right guy, I don’t want to say in public what should be done to him.” But Mr. Orton, 57, a disabled Vietnam veteran, wanted to make one other point crystal-clear following a news conference Tuesday at a Midtown firehouse: He was the one who first notified the police about the suspicious vehicle, not anyone else. “You can’t have 10 heroes,” Mr. Orton said. One other street vendor, Duane Jackson, has also said he told the police about the Pathfinder, which was parked with the engine running and hazard lights flashing about 6:30 p.m. on Saturday on 45th Street near Seventh Avenue. Mr. Jackson, also a disabled Vietnam veteran, has been hailed as a hero and has also received a congratulatory phone call from the president. At first, Mr. Jackson was the more public face of this only-in-New York slice of the failed car bombing in Times Square – the sharp-eyed street vendors who noticed the suspicious vehicle and alerted an officer on horseback. But as Mr. Orton claims his share of the limelight, he has questioned whether Mr. Jackson had played a significant role. “He was across the street, with his arms folded, looking around, while we were doing what we did,” Mr. Orton said of Mr. Jackson. “I don’t know what he said. I’m the one who grabbed Officer Wayne” – meaning Wayne Rhatigan, the mounted officer who was the first to approach the Pathfinder. “There can’t be two heroes. I don’t want anyone riding on my story.” If Mr. Jackson had been the first to notify the authorities, Mr. Orton said, then he should have been questioned extensively by the authorities in the aftermath of the attempted bombing, as Mr. Orton said he and the men he works with had been. “He was home when we were being grilled,” Mr. Orton said. “That’s the real deal.” Mr. Jackson, 58, of Buchanan, N.Y., who could not be located Tuesday to address Mr. Orton’s claims, has said that he heard popping sounds coming from the vehicle and smelled some sort of firecracker. “There are a bunch of us disabled vets selling here, and we’re used to being vigilant because we all know that freedom isn’t free,” Mr. Jackson told The New York Times on Sunday. Mr. Jackson spoke with reporters and tourists on Sunday standing at his usual spot on 45th Street where he sells cheap handbags, watches and scarves, receiving endless congratulations from passers-by and customers. The next day, he granted more interviews and visited the F.B.I.’s New York headquarters. Mr. Orton, on the other hand, avoided speaking publicly about his role in discovering the vehicle on Sunday, and he gave his first extended interview on Monday when he sat down with Meredith Vieira and Matt Lauer on the “Today” show. On Tuesday, Mr. Orton stood beside Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other city officials at a news conference at a firehouse on Eighth Avenue at 48th Street, home to Engine Company 54, Ladder 4 and Battalion 9, the first to respond. Mr. Orton, who lives in the Bronx and has sold T-shirts in Times Square for years, said that when he noticed the Pathfinder from his sidewalk vending spot, the vehicle was smoking a little bit. Then the smoke grew steadily worse. He said that he tried to call out to Officer Rhatigan, whom he said he knows, but that the officer did not hear him. So he had one of the three men who work with him summon Officer Rhatigan, who came over on his horse, he said. “I said, ‘Look at this vehicle right here,’” Mr. Orton said. Mr. Bloomberg thanked Mr. Orton, and his remarks seemed to give credence, whether accidentally or on purpose, to Mr. Orton’s version of events. The mayor told reporters: “As you know, Lance is the person who first alerted us to a suspicious vehicle in Times Square.” Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman, said that the first person who approached the officer was actually Wayne Robinson, one of the three men who work with Mr. Orton. Mr. Brown said in an e-mail that Officer Rhatigan “knows Wayne and recalls specifically it was him.” Update, 3:33 p.m. | Mr. Jackson was not working on 45th Street on Tuesday afternoon and could not be reached for comment. But the plot thickened with the appearance of a third vendor, Alioune B. Niass, who said that he was the first one to notice the smoking Pathfinder. “I feel somebody cheat me,” said Mr. Niass, who said he is friends with both Mr. Orton and Mr. Jackson. Mr. Niass, an immigrant from Senegal who sells photographs of celebrities and the New York skyline, said that he saw the car smoking and walked over to a pay phone booth at the corner to call 911. Before he completed the call, however, he told Mr. Orton, who was sitting next to the phones, to look at the vehicle. He said Mr. Orton was not aware that the car was smoking until he told him. “I saw it before he see it,” said Mr. Niass. “I’m the first person who saw it.” Mr. Orton told him not to call 911 but to instead alert the officer, Mr. Niass said. Before he could do so, however, Mr. Robinson had already summoned the officer. After the news conference Tuesday, Mr. Orton was surrounded by a crush of reporters and cameras. He wore a baseball cap with a United States Navy logo and had a green washcloth tucked into a back pocket. He said that he was invited to dinner with the mayor on Sunday. “I was supposed to go, but I had to get some sleep,” said Mr. Orton, who walks with a cane. Mr. Orton said he has been overwhelmed in recent days by the attention. He said he had planned to go back to work on Wednesday, but now he was not sure. Asked if he was proud of what he did, Mr. Orton said that that wasn’t the right word. “I’m thankful for what I did,” he said, adding, “As I told Matt Lauer yesterday, I’d be playing a harp right now.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article is about two street vendors, Lance Orton and Duane Jackson, who both claim to be the first person who alerted the police about a smoking car in Times Square.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Kuwait, a military unit uncovers an American helicopter downed by friendly fire at least three years ago. As the wreckage is inspected, Master Sergeant Sam Harper (David \\"Shark\\" Fralick), one of the burnt bodies within, springs to life, kills a sergeant and a major (William Smith), and returns to an inert state after muttering, \\"Don't be afraid, it's only friendly fire!\\"Several weeks later, Sam's body is delivered to his hometown of Twin Rivers, which is preparing for the annual July 4th Independence Day festival. Sam's wife Louise (Anne Tremko) is given custody of the casket containing Sam's remains, which are left in the home of Sam's estranged sister Sally (Leslie Neale), who lives with her patriotic young son, Jody (Christopher Ogden). Sam reanimates in the early hours of the Fourth of July, and proceeds to kill and steal the costume of a perverted Uncle Sam named Willie (Mark Chadwick) who spies on young nudable women undressing in their bedrooms. Sam then makes his way to a cemetery, where he murders two of three juvenile delinquents who had vandalized tombstones, and desecrated an American flag.During the Independence Day celebration, which a corrupt congressman (Robert Forster) is visiting Sam beheads the third delinquent, kills Jody's teacher (who had opposed the Vietnam War) with a hatchet, and shoots Sally's unscrupulous lawyer boyfriend in the head. Despite these deaths, the festivities continue, but are thrown into disarray when Sam uses the fireworks gear to blow up the congressman, and a flagpole to impale Louise's deputy boyfriend. As this occurs and the various attendees flee, Jody is told by his mother and aunt that his supposedly heroic idol Sam was in fact an alcoholic psychopath who physically and sexually abused them, and only joined the military so he could get a \\"free pass\\" to kill people.Jody is told by Barry, another boy who has established an unexplained mental link with Sam, that the undead Sam is responsible for the deaths. With help from Sam's old mentor Jed (Isaac Hayes), the... Answer:","output":"Considering the movie plot provided, a possible question to generate could be: How does Jody's perception of his Uncle Sam change throughout the film, and what role does his realization about Sam's true nature play in the climax of the story, ultimately leading to the confrontation between Jody, Sam, and Jed? This question tackles the theme of disillusionment and the impact that newfound knowledge can have on someone's perspective, specifically in the context of hero-worship and patriotism. By asking about the transformation in Jody's perception of his uncle and the consequences of this transformation, the question encourages an analysis of character development and the role that truth plays in the progression of the storyline. As the movie unfolds, young Jody initially views his Uncle Sam as a patriotic hero, a belief likely cultivated by his family's military background and the glorification of military service often present in small-town America. As Sam's atrocities continue, Jody's innocence is gradually disrupted, culminating in the horrifying revelation that the supposedly honorable Sam was actually an abusive, psychopathic alcoholic who exploited his military service as an outlet for his violent tendencies. With this newfound knowledge, Jody is forced to reconcile his prior beliefs with the ugly truth about Uncle Sam's true nature. This realization initiates a significant shift in Jody's character development, leading him to actively participate in confronting and stopping Sam, rather than continuing to idolize him. Furthermore, Jody's changing perception is crucial in driving the movie towards its climax, where he teams up with Sam's old mentor Jed to confront the undead Sam. Jody's journey can be seen as a symbol of the broader disillusionment one experiences when confronted with the reality of their heroes or ideals. In this particular case, Jody's idealization of his Uncle Sam is shattered in light of the truth, resulting in a profound transformation in his character and actions. By posing a question that focuses on this aspect of the movie, the discussion can delve deeper into themes of patriotism, hero-worship, and illusions versus reality, enriching the overall understanding and interpretation of the film."},{"instruction":"Q:Process: - Two birds meet each other - Egg is produced after fertilziation - Mother sits on egg until it hatches - Bird Hatches - Grows up - Flee the next - Starts family - Dies.

Earlier this month, Adam Nash, the chief executive of Wealthfront, explained the strange way this tends to happen at work. In a Corner Office column, he told my colleague Adam Bryant that if workplace leaders don’t identify specific metrics to focus on, smart people will just make up their own. And because these employees are intelligent and persuasive, they’ll quickly convince themselves that their objective is the most sensible one. Wealthfront helps people invest their money in a more rational fashion than they might if they were left to their own devices. So I couldn’t help but wonder about a corollary to Mr. Nash’s point: Are there metrics that we cling to in our financial lives that end up being wildly counterproductive? And if so, what should we be replacing them with? With the help of a number of people who diagnose other people’s financial delusions for a living and help provide solutions, I picked six metrics to share. I.Q. Just because you can solve doctoral-level math problems in the realm of data science does not mean you can also pick stocks that will outperform the rest of the market. But many programmers with high I.Q.s try anyway. They do it so often, in fact, that Mr. Nash has developed a presentation that he delivers in front of groups of them to try to talk them out of it. The replacement metric here might be your pulse. If you read a book about investing and get excited, it’s a bad indicator. “Good investing is exceptionally boring,” Mr. Nash said. A related issue is perceived smarts, particularly involving financial matters. A recent Charles Schwab survey found that people who identified themselves as financially “savvy” were more likely to answer questions incorrectly about several matters, including disability insurance and taxes, than people who said they were less savvy. RETURN ENTITLEMENT This is the investment return that people expect to get on their entire portfolio just because somebody said they got it on part of their portfolio over a brief period. Except the entitled never quite see it that way. Manisha Thakor, the founder of MoneyZen Wealth Management in Santa Fe, N.M., said there was a pattern she saw often. Someone has heard about an accountant who got a 28 percent return on a client’s investment. But it’s never clear, upon further questioning, whether it’s all of the investments or over what period of time. Or someone sees an article in the newspaper about the highest-performing stock or market sector of the year. Whatever it is, expectations get set: People want that return all the time, forever, on everything. “The most important part of it is how we pick up on a single data point and extrapolate it into an entire portfolio,” Ms. Thakor said. “And it’s happening with really smart people.” Ms. Thakor suggests tamping down natural competitive instincts and replacing the outsize expectations with a realistic assessment of how much risk you can really take with your savings. That is what ought to dictate the contents of a portfolio, not how someone else did with their Twitter stock over a couple of weeks after the initial public offering. THE NEXT CUBICLE As chief executive of NerdWallet, a financial advice and tools site, Tim Chen often finds himself in conversations with employees about salary and title. And he’s come to believe that people need to spend less time tracking relative career performance. So what does that mean? He recently read “The Hard Thing About Hard Things,” by Ben Horowitz, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Mr. Chen’s conclusion was that too many people based their happiness on whether they were being compensated in a similar way to a worse performer at a similar level at their company (or someone one level up who isn’t as talented). He suggested looking at absolute performance instead, including a frank assessment of whether you truly could command more money elsewhere. A related issue, for him, is the overall quality level of the talent pool in your own organization. If it’s way above average, then you’re probably learning a lot and should think hard about whether leaving to make 10 percent more at a mediocre shop is a move that will make you happier. PRETAX DOLLARS Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz, a Charles Schwab senior vice president and author of “The Charles Schwab Guide to Finances After Fifty,” suggested rethinking your Social Security statement. There are two things wrong with it. First, the benefit the government promises is a pretax number. People tend to forget that they’ll be paying income taxes on it once they collect. Second, Medicare costs will also take a chunk of that money. MONTHLY DEBT It’s easy to lull ourselves into complacency as long as we’re making our various loan payments on time each month. But Charles Farrell, a financial adviser in Denver and author of “Your Money Ratios,” thinks that people should do a bit of math before patting themselves on the back. Add up your total debt, then divide it by your total income. The result should not be a number higher than about 2.25. So if you have 100,000 in income, servicing any more than 225,000 in debt could make it hard for you to save enough for goals like retirement and college tuition. That could mean working longer or borrowing even more. Debt is something we have a lot of control over, Mr. Farrell noted. But we also rationalize taking it on because it can help us get to bigger goals faster. NEUTERED NUMBERS In her work with widows and others who are making big financial decisions on their own for the first time, Karen Altfest often finds that metrics of any sort are not wholly adequate. That’s because they can’t address the emotional side of money — feelings of fear or regret or inadequacy or unworthiness. When strong feelings keep people from trusting the numbers, she said, one thing that can help is a continuing discussion with a trusted, calming person. Ms. Altfest is a financial planner, so this is in her interest, but she was quick to note that a sibling, neighbor or friend could fill that role. She also urges people providing that compassionate ear not to rush. “You don’t have to say right away where you’ll be in 20 years,” she said. She recently sat down with a widowed client who wasn’t seeing her granddaughters as much as she wanted because she couldn’t bring herself to spring for the taxi fare. Ms. Altfest worked it out with her — a 15 cab ride over the course of a number of visits. Eventually, the client agreed that it was affordable. The first steps may be tiny ones. “But you don’t want to do anything more than they’re ready for,” Ms. Altfest said. “Otherwise, they’re never going to believe you.” A version of this article appears in print on June 21, 2014, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: 6 New Ways to Measure Money Goals.

At the New York Bulletin newspaper, its owner, Robert Drexel Gow, receives a teletype story that the newspaper's thirty-nine-year-old editor, Max Wharton, is resigning to enlist in the army. Robert is livid, both at the news and the method that he found out about the news. There is a second story on the teletype: Max's wife, the famous novelist Paula Wharton (whom Max calls Paulie), is in Hollywood adapting her latest book into a movie screenplay. Max wants to do his duty as a citizen and responsible journalist to be close to the war. Robert's view is that without Max, the newspaper will fold because Max *is* the newspaper. From Hollywood, Paulie telephones Max and congratulates him on his decision. After Max informs her of the plan of basic training then possibly officer's candidate school, Paulie decides that she will move to where ever that school is to be close to him.

French production in which leading film directors from 11 countries were invited to create 11-minute short films conveying their reflections on the events of September 11. The film segments vary widely in content and quality. Two allude to U.S. complicity in terrorist acts (in Chile against Allende, who died on September 11, 1973, depicted in the segment by British director Ken Loach; and in Palestine by U.S.-backed Israelis, shown in the segment from Egyptian director Youssef Chahine). Two more recall other destructive acts (a Palestinian suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, shot by Israeli director Amos Gitan; the Japanese \\"holy war\\" against the west in WW II, by Shohei Imamura). Ironies abound in several stories. Shadows that darken the New York City apartment of a grieving old man suddenly disappear as the World Trade towers telescope to the ground in Sean Penn's piece, bringing the man momentary joy. But in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone. In Mira Nair's film, based on a real incident, a missing young man, also in New York City, the son of a Pakistani family, is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist, but later he proves to a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers. There are poignant moments dotted throughout. Loach has his exiled Chilean man quote St. Augustine, to the effect that hope is built of anger and courage: anger at the way things are, courage to change them. Imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war. Samira Makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young Afghan schoolchildren, exiled in Iran, trying to tell them about the events that have just transpired in New York. But they are understandably more impressed with a major event in their refugee camp, where two men have fallen into a deep well, one killed, the other sustaining a broken leg. This is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the 6 year olds.  Idrissa Ouedraogo, from Burkina Faso, creates a drama in which the son of an ailing woman spots Osama bin Laden in their village and gathers his buddies to help capture the fugitive terrorist, in order to get the 25 million U. S. reward. He tells his friends not to let any of the adults know their plans, for the older folks would merely waste the money on cars and cigarettes, while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute. It is Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (maker of \\"Amores Perros\\") who provides by far the most powerful and chilling segment, one that, for the most part, shows only a darkened screen with audio tape loops of chanting and voices and occasional thudding sounds. Brief visual flashes gradually permit us to see bodies falling from the high floors of the towers, and it dawns on us that the thuds are these bodies hitting the ground. The sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and a still shot, bearing a phrase first shown only in Arabic, then with a translation added: \\"Does God's light guide us or blind us?\\" (In various languages with English subtitles) Grade: 8/10 (B+).

Vaikka budjetti on tärkeä näkökohta, näyttää siltä, että tässä yhteydessä kysymys liittyy myös laajemmin päätöksentekoon ja resurssien hallintaan. On syytä tutkia muita tekijöitä, jotka voivat vaikuttaa organisaation talouteen ja tavoitteiden saavuttamiseen, sekä budjetoinnin mahdollisia vaikutuksia henkilöstöön ja muihin keskeisiin sidosryhmiin. Hallinnassa budjetti ei ole ainoa asia, joka täytyy ottaa huomioon talouden kokonaiskuvan ymmärtämisessä ja hyvien päätösten tekemisessä. Organisaatiot joutuvat tasapainottamaan monia muita seikkoja, kuten kustannusten leikkausten vaikutuksia toimintojen laatuun, liikevaihtoon ja asiakastyytyväisyyteen. Lisäksi tulee miettiä investointien mielekkyyttä ja pitkän aikavälin palautusta niin taloudellisesta kuin toiminnallisistakin näkökulmista. On tärkeää tarkastella monia muita taloudellisia tunnuslukuja ja indikaattoreita, kuten liikevoittoa, kassavirtaa ja pääomakustannuksia, jotta voidaan paremmin arvioida ja hallita riskejä, tunnistaa mahdollisia ongelmia ja määrittää organisaation kasvumahdollisuuksia. Budjetin seuraaminen ja raportointi ovat tärkeitä, mutta ne eivät saisi olla ainoa huolenaihe päätöksenteossa. Budjetointiin liittyvät päätökset voivat vaikuttaa myös henkilöstöön ja työympäristöön. On tärkeää ottaa huomioon, miten kustannussäästöt ja sijoitukset vaikuttavat työntekijöiden työmotivaatioon, tyytyväisyyteen ja työsuoritukseen. Henkilöstöpolitiikan muutoksia suunnitellessa täytyy ymmärtää, miten ne vaikuttavat työntekijöihin ja organisaation sisäiseen ilmapiiriin. Siksi on tärkeää, että päätöksentekijät ja johtajat tarkastelevat laajempaa kuvaa ja ymmärtävät, että budjetointi on vain yksi osa taloushallinnassa ja liiketoiminnan kehittämisessä. Onnistunut budjetointiprosessi perustuu paitsi tarkkaan taloussuunnitteluun myös jatkuvaan seurantaan, analysointiin ja viestintään kaikkien asianosaisten kanssa. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että budjetin merkitys on keskeinen talouden onnistuneessa hallinnassa, mutta sen ulottuvuudet ulottuvat paljon laajemmalle kuin vain numeroiden hallintaan. Tarkastelemalla monipuolisia näkökulmia, päätöksentekijät voivat tehdä harkittuja valintoja organisaation tavoitteiden saavuttamiseksi ja sen kasvun tukemiseksi."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.

And the answer is?","output":"The answer to the trivia question, \\"What is the world's largest inland body of water?\\" is the Caspian Sea.  Covering an area of approximately 371,000 square kilometers (143,000 square miles), the Caspian Sea is the world's largest inland body of water by surface area, and it is bordered by five countries: Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, and Azerbaijan. It is often referred to as both a lake and a sea due to its unique characteristics and historical classification. The Caspian Sea is of great importance to the surrounding region due to its rich natural resources, including oil and natural gas reserves, fish populations, and trade routes. The Caspian Sea formed approximately 5.5 million years ago as a result of geological processes. It is located approximately 28 meters (92 feet) below sea level, making it the largest below-sea-level depression on Earth. It was once part of the ancient Tethys Ocean, which became separated from the main oceans over time as continents drifted and geological processes unfolded. One fascinating feature of the Caspian Sea is its fluctuating salinity levels. The northern part, fed primarily by the Volga River, is roughly one-third as salty as typical seawater, while the southern part, which receives less freshwater input, has salinity levels closer to those of the world's oceans. This vast water body supports a unique and diverse range of marine life, such as the Caspian seal, which is found nowhere else on Earth. Aside from its marine life, the Caspian Sea has also been a crucial source of sturgeon, which produce the world-famous and highly valued caviar. However, in recent decades, fish populations have faced severe threats due to overfishing, habitat degradation, and pollution. In summary, the Caspian Sea is the world's largest inland body of water, with a rich history, unique geological features, and diverse ecosystems. It plays a significant role in the economy, culture, and environment of the surrounding countries and is an important natural resource both locally and globally."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is an article: By Zachary Roth of Yahoo! News and Shushannah Walshe of ABC News DES MOINES–Colette Noble’s kids used to tell her, “You’ll never lose your job–you work too hard.” Noble’s voice choked up and her eyes welled with tears as she recounted the exchange. ”I used to say, ‘You know what–you never know,’ ” she said, during an interview last week at a Starbucks here. “There are lots of good people who worked hard that lost their jobs.” Noble was laid off in January as an account manager at CDS Global, an Iowa-based subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation, where she worked for two decades. She was the was the sole breadwinner for her family of four. Her two sons are 15 and 17. Her husband, a lawyer, stopped working several years ago after becoming addicted to Oxycontin, a painkiller that a doctor prescribed him for back pain. Noble, who is 48, threw herself into the search for a new job. “If there’s a resource to be found, I feel like I’ve found it, ” she said. But nearly a year later, she’s still looking. She’s now unable to pay the mortgage on her house. Her long and fruitless search is hardly uncommon. The political class thinks of Iowa these days mostly as a staging ground for the long presidential campaign surrounding January’s first-in-the-nation caucuses (including Saturday’s Republican presidential debate at Drake University, sponsored by Yahoo! and ABC News). But for many people in Iowa, the most important day-to-day concern is the state’s struggle, along with the rest of the country, to throw off the effects of the Great Recession and the halting recovery that’s followed. Although low by national standards, Iowa’s official unemployment rate has spiked to 6 percent–around 99,000 people–from 3.7 percent in 2007, before the economic downturn began. And jobless spells are lasting longer than ever. Iowa’s long-term unemployment rate–the share of the 99,000 unemployed who have been out of work for 6 months or more–is 34 percent, nearly twice what it was before the downturn began. “We look better, it sounds better, it feels better,” said David Swenson, an economist who teaches at Iowa State University. “But in fact we have a lot of the stresses and the consequences of the recession that the rest of the nation has.” Iowa didn’t have much of a housing bubble, so it escaped the worst of the crash. And thanks to high food prices, its agricultural sector is booming, helping to keep the rest of the state’s economy afloat. But Swenson said Iowa’s relatively low jobless rate is deceptive. Many of Iowa’s younger workers–those under 45–tend to move to places like Kansas City, St. Louis, and Chicago, where there’s more work. “So our historically low unemployment rate is a function of that as well,” Swenson said. “Our surplus labor that we can’t use, it goes someplace else. It’s unemployed elsewhere.” Compounding the problem, the recession exacerbated a nationwide trend that was already underway: a shift toward jobs with lower pay and fewer hours. The jobs gained in Iowa since the recession officially ended in 2009 pay more than 5,000 less, on average, than those lost during the downturn, according to a recent report by the Iowa Policy Project, a union-backed group. Iowa is one of only three states in which wages for low-, median-, and high-wage workers were all lower last year, after adjusting for inflation, than they were a decade earlier. Colette Noble said she’d be “thrilled” to get a job that paid 60 or 70 percent of what she was making before. Workers of all ages have been hit hard, but Iowans between the ages of 25 and 54 saw a greater rise in unemployment than their younger and older cohorts, the report found. “People that are in their 40s and 50s are not finding work,” Swenson said. Noble said one company where she applied for a job called her in seven times for interviews and seemed poised to make her an offer, but ended up going with someone else. She suspects her age and experience counted against her, because the firm was looking for someone younger and cheaper. Jerry Schutt lost his senior position at MediNotes, an electronic medical records firm, in 2009 after a decade of work there. He’s 58, and he thinks the same thing happened to him. At job fairs, he said, employers “see the resume and they think, This guy, he’s gonna want 80 or 90 thousand dollars. And it’s hard to convince them that all I want is an interview.” Schutt’s genial manner (“get up every day, take a shower, pretend like you’re going to work,” he advises, for how to handle unemployment) has survived his jobless stint. But he’s been forced to reinvent himself. From late last year until July, Schutt worked on a failed technology venture with a friend. Lately he’s been helping out a friend who runs a social media marketing firm, getting up to speed on Twitter and LinkedIn. “Technology isn’t just going to go away,” he said over beers at a La Quinta hotel in West Des Moines. That day, he had contacted Des Moines’s transit authority about a job as a bus driver. Schutt’s wife lost her job last year, and the new one she found pays about half as much. “We lost 75 percent of our income,” Schutt said. The financial shock has put a strain on his marriage. Earlier this year, citing budget constraints, Terry Branstad, the Republican governor of Iowa, announced the closure of most of Iowa’s Workforce Development centers, which offer help with job searches and training. The office closings turned some staff employees into the ranks of the jobless, who had previously been their clients. Kasey Friedrichsen was laid off from Denison’s center in August after two years on the job. But she said she’s perhaps most concerned about the effects of the office’s closing on Denison’s large Hispanic community. “For somebody who might not speak English very fluently, to be able to have us, step by step, help them fill out the application was crucial,” Friedrichsen said in an interview at the American Pie Cafe, a restaurant in Avoca, in western Iowa. Friedrichsen, who is 24, has bounced back quickly. A political junkie since high school, whose poise, maturity, and youthful ambition recall another prairie-state striver, the fictional Tracy Flick of the novel and movie “Election,” she’ll soon complete a masters degree in public administration, and–inspired in part by the office closings–is running next fall as a Democrat for the state legislature. Friedrichsen caucused for Joe Biden in 2008, and said she hasn’t been paying much attention to the Republican race this year. But Jerry Schutt described himself as a “very very strong Republican.” He suggested he’s leaning toward Newt Gingrich. Colette Noble, who volunteered for Howard Dean in 2004 and backed Hillary Clinton the last time around, said she has watched some of the 2012 presidential debates, but “there just seems to be a lot of noise.” Still, she said she’ll likely caucus again, this time as a Republican. She agrees with Mitt Romney on some issues but wonders whether workers will benefit from the corporate tax cuts he advocates. Other Iowans are looking beyond mainstream politics. Danielle Ryan, a student at Iowa State and an organizer with Occupy Des Moines, which since October has been camped near the state capitol building, said that for some unemployed Iowans, the movement has offered a voice. “They say: I lost my job but found my occupation,” Ryan said. Others are just trying to get by. Larry Colbert has been living at Central Iowa Shelter and Services, a homeless shelter, after being unable to find permanent work in Kansas City and Des Moines. Colbert, who is 37, was laid off from his job with a lawn services company two years ago. He lost his apartment after being thrown off unemployment benefits. For the last few weeks he has worked temporary jobs, collecting trash and moving materials on construction sites. It’s a blow to his pride. “I wish I could help myself,” said Colbert, sitting at a plastic table in the shelter’s main hall. “I don’t look for the public to help me. I’d rather do it myself. But it’s just been a struggle, man.” Last week, Colette Noble told her son’s Catholic school that he was being moved to a public school as a cost-cutting measure. “I’m not gonna say that’s a hardship,” she said. “But for him, his world’s been turned upside down.” Noble recently tried to change the payment schedule on her mortgage. But her lender wouldn’t agree to the change because she wasn’t working. She wasn’t eligible for a mortgage modification program, she was told. Schutt, too, is downsizing. Eight years ago, he and his wife built a large, “kid-friendly” house designed with their eight grandchildren in mind. Now they’re putting it on the market and planning to move into a smaller townhouse. Being out of work has been “life-changing” for Schutt. Talking to workers in their 20s at job fairs gets discouraging. “When I was at that age,” he said, “I was on top of the world. I was invincible.” Zachary Roth is a senior national affairs reporter for Yahoo News. Shushannah Walshe is a digital reporter for ABC News.

MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea.  When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice.  Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya.

Yet, there are ways to transform your living spaces without breaking the bank. By exploring creative methods to obtain free items, visiting garage sales, and repurposing existing home decor elements, you can revamp your space with minimal spending.  In this article, we outline helpful tips on finding free and low-cost items for your home makeover process. Moreover, we will show you how to breathe new life into your living areas with unique and inexpensive finds. Step 1: Find Free Things Before starting any project, take note of the items you already own. Consider what can be repurposed or rearranged to suit your new design. Moreover, try seeking out free things in your community: 1. Join online platforms such as Freecycle, Buy Nothing Facebook groups, or Craigslist's 'Free' section to discover free items being given away in your area. 2. Connect with friends, family, or neighbors who might be decluttering or looking to offload unused furniture pieces. 3. Visit local excavations or construction sites and ask for permission to collect free materials such as wood, bricks, or tiles. 4. Attend community events like spring cleaning days, where neighbors share or give away items they no longer need. Step 2: Go to Garage Sales Garage sales offer an excellent opportunity to find budget-friendly treasures that can be repurposed or creatively used in your home. Follow these tips for successful garage sale shopping: 1. Start early, so you have the best chance to score the most unique and valuable items. 2. Bring small bills and change to facilitate easy transactions. 3. Negotiate with the sellers, but don't be rude or low-ball offers—consider a reasonable price for both parties. 4. Keep an open mind and think about the potential to upcycle or refurbish garage sale finds into something that matches your decor. Step 3: Ask for Old Swatch Books at Wallpaper Stores Swatch books contain various wallpaper designs and can be a goldmine for creative decoration ideas. Inquire at your local wallpaper store if they have any older or unused swatch books that they are willing to give away. These books can be utilized in multiple ways: 1. As inspiration for color palettes and patterns. 2. To create art pieces by framing or mounting choice sections of wallpaper. 3. To cover small items like books, boxes, or lampshades for a cohesive design look. Step 4: Move Furniture and Art from Other Places in Your House A simple way to change the overall look of a room is by rearranging pre-existing elements or borrowing pieces from other areas within your home. Here are some suggestions: 1. Move furniture to different places, creating new focal points and a fresh perspective on your room layout. 2. Swap art or wall hangings between rooms, giving your walls a renewed aesthetic. 3. Experiment with different rug or textile combinations, layering or interchanging them between spaces. 4. Mix and match accessories such as cushions, vases, and ornaments from various parts of your home to create new vignettes. Conclusion Redecorating or refreshing your home doesn't have to be expensive. With creativity, resourcefulness, and a willingness to embrace upcycling, you can transform your living spaces on a shoestring budget.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which event took place first, the death of George IV or a fire that obliterated the Palace of Westminster? Context: Remodelling of the structure began in 1762. After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834. The answer is:","output":"To answer the question: \\"Which event took place first, the death of George IV or a fire that obliterated the Palace of Westminster?\\", let's go through the context step by step: 1. King George IV's accession to the throne in 1820. 2. King George IV decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash in 1826. 3. The cost of renovations escalated, and Nash was removed as architect in 1829. 4. George IV died in 1830, and his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. 5. The Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire in 1834. Now we can compare the events to determine which one happened first: - Death of George IV: 1830 - Obliteration of the Palace of Westminster by fire: 1834 After comparing the dates, it is clear that the death of George IV happened first in 1830, followed by the fire that obliterated the Palace of Westminster in 1834."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Katrina had a disorganized office. Katrina found work to be more stressful than Monica, because Katrina had a disorganized office.  Step 1: Recognize the source of stress Katrina realized that the disorganization in her office was causing her stress and making work more challenging than it should be. Her desk was cluttered with paperwork, and she often struggled to find important documents when she needed them. Step 2: Create a plan to address the issue In order to combat the stress and improve her work environment, Katrina decided to create a plan for organizing her office. She set aside an afternoon to focus on decluttering her workspace and implementing organizational systems to keep her tasks, files, and stationery in order. Step 3: Implement the plan During the dedicated afternoon, Katrina began by organizing all loose papers and files. She put them into labeled folders and filed them away in her filing cabinet in a manner that would make it easy to locate any specific document when required. She also set up a designated spot for all her stationery, creating a clean and organized workspace on her desk. Step 4: Establish routines to maintain order To prevent her office from becoming disorganized again, Katrina made a commitment to maintaining order in her workspace. She set up a routine where she would spend the last 10 minutes of her workday organizing her desk and making sure that everything was in its proper place. This way, she would have a fresh and organized start to each day. Step 5: Reevaluate and adjust as needed Over time, Katrina began to notice a decrease in her stress levels, as her organized office was making it easier for her to stay on track with her work. However, she also stayed open to adjusting her systems and routines if necessary, to ensure that her work environment continued to support her ability to be productive and focused. As Katrina's workspace became more organized, the difference in stress levels between her and Monica became less pronounced. With her new organizational systems in place, Katrina was better equipped to handle the demands of her job, and her workday became more enjoyable and manageable."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem: if x + y = 4 and x 2 y 3 + y 2 x 3 = 36 , what is the value of xy ?","output":"To solve this problem, follow these steps: 1. First, understand the task. You are provided with two given relationships:   - x + y = 4   - x^2 * y^3 + y^2 * x^3 = 36    And the task is to find the value of xy. 2. From the first equation, x + y = 4, this tells us that we can solve one variable in terms of the other. For simplicity, let's solve for y:    - y = 4 - x 3. Now we have an expression for y in terms of x. We can substitute this expression into the second equation to eliminate y and have an equation involving only x.   - Replace y in the second equation (x^2 * y^3 + y^2 * x^3 = 36) with (4 - x):   - x^2 * (4 - x)^3 + (4 - x)^2 * x^3 = 36 4. Next, simplify the equation by expanding the expression. You might notice that the equation will be a polynomial which can be factored and the like terms can be combined:   - x^2 * (4 - x)^3 + (4 - x)^2 * x^3 = 36 5. Solve the equation for x by finding its roots using either an algebraic method or a numerical method like the Newton Raphson method. 6. Once you find the value of x, you can plug it back into the equation y = 4 - x to find the value of y. 7. With both x and y values, you can calculate their product, xy.

Darwin began speculating, in a series of notebooks, on the possibility that \\"one species does change into another\\" to explain these findings, and around July sketched a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, discarding Lamarck's independent lineages progressing to higher forms.

Ask your doctor about a prescription. Look into injections.\\"","output":"Title: Treating Heartburn and Acid Reflux: Exploring Different Options Introduction Heartburn and acid reflux are common yet irritating medical conditions that affect a significant number of people at some point in their lives. Both heartburn and acid reflux are caused due to the excess production of stomach acid that irritates the lining of the esophagus, causing a burning sensation or chest pain. While the occasional occurrence of these conditions is manageable with over-the-counter medication or lifestyle changes, chronic heartburn and acid reflux may require a more comprehensive treatment plan. In this article, we will explore different methods to treat these conditions, including checking the dosage on tablets, using syrups, consulting a doctor for a prescription, and considering injections as a potential treatment option. Step 1: Check the Dosage on Tablets If you are experiencing heartburn or acid reflux, one of the initial steps you can take is to carefully examine the dosage of over-the-counter antacid tablets. Ensure that you are taking the correct dose as per the instructions mentioned on the packaging or as directed by a healthcare professional. Over-the-counter antacid tablets contain various active ingredients, such as aluminum hydroxide or magnesium carbonate, which help neutralize stomach acids and provide relief from heartburn and acid reflux symptoms. Adhering to the recommended dosage ensures the medication's effectiveness and prevents possible side effects due to overconsumption. Step 2: Use a Syrup for Heartburn and Acid Reflux In addition to tablets, over-the-counter syrups are also effective in managing heartburn and acid reflux symptoms. These syrups typically contain antacids or acid reducers that work by neutralizing stomach acids or reducing the acid production in the stomach, providing relief from discomfort. Syrups are often preferred by those who have trouble swallowing tablets, and they may also provide quicker relief. Just like tablets, it is important to follow the recommended dosage instructions for syrups and consult a healthcare professional if symptoms persist despite the recommended treatment. Step 3: Ask Your Doctor About a Prescription When over-the-counter medication and lifestyle modifications fail to provide relief from chronic heartburn and acid reflux symptoms, it is crucial to consult your doctor. Your doctor will evaluate your symptoms, medical history, and may perform diagnostic tests to determine the best course of action. They may prescribe stronger medication, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 receptor blockers, which are more potent in alleviating heartburn and acid reflux symptoms. Always consult your doctor before starting any new prescription medications and follow their instructions to ensure the best results. Step 4: Look Into Injections In some cases, when patients fail to respond to oral treatments or cannot tolerate oral medications due to side effects, they may be recommended injections as an alternative means of treatment. Injectable medication options, such as Domperidone or Metoclopramide, work by increasing the movement of food through the stomach and thus reducing acid build-up. This form of treatment should only be considered as a last resort or for specific medical circumstances that warrant injections. As with any medical treatment, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of injectable medications with your healthcare provider before opting for this method. Conclusion The most crucial aspect of treating heartburn and acid reflux is to find the appropriate form of medication and treatment that works best for you. This may involve experimenting with various options, such as over-the-counter tablets, syrups, prescription medications, or injections under the guidance of a healthcare professional. By carefully and diligently following dosage instructions or your doctor's advice, you can efficiently manage and alleviate the uncomfortable and distressing symptoms of heartburn and acid reflux."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(American Girl/Peter Jakubowski)      The newest American Girl historical doll is named Melody Ellison, an African-American girl growing up in 1960s Detroit amid the civil rights movement. Her backstory has its roots in a UWM public history class.      “Urban history was a topic I wasn’t familiar with, and it was some of the earliest reading from (UWM history professor Amanda Seligman’s) coursework that … informed the beginning of this character,” said Mark Speltz, a 2009 graduate with a master’s in public history.      Speltz is a senior historian at the American Girl company, which publishes fictional stories of young girls set in significant time periods in U.S. history. Speltz leads a research team responsible for crafting the historical details of each character’s story, from the food she eats to the clothes she wears. American Girl dolls are paired with books that help depict an era.      Melody was his latest project, which dovetailed nicely with his personal research, civil rights era photography.      “I’ve been focusing on the 20th century and the civil rights era now for the past 10 years, and I have a photography book coming out this fall from the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The main focus is the movement beyond the South – places like Cleveland, Milwaukee, New York, Los Angeles, places we don’t think about when we hear ‘civil rights,’” Speltz said.      Speltz’s background knowledge may have started in UWM’s classrooms – he took one course a semester for five years to complete his degree – but his work for American Girl takes him all over the United States. Once a character’s setting and time period are decided, the historians research the era in detail.      To learn more about 1960s Detroit, Speltz organized tours at the Motown Museum, the Henry Ford Museum and the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit. He and his team talked with the Detroit Historical Society and visited neighborhoods and schools. An advisory panel included members who were experts on the time period, had grown up in Detroit or participated in the June 1963 Walk to Freedom alongside Martin Luther King Jr.      The author chosen to pen the new character’s series was along for the ride, and Speltz and a project editor were on hand to help the writer flesh out descriptions and background.      At the same time, the doll was being designed. Authenticity is very important to American Girl’s success, Speltz said.      “At our board meetings, we’d show some of our early ideas and concepts and people would critique them,” Speltz said. “There were a lot of great ideas that come out of those meetings. We work through anything that can be challenging on projects like this, such as skin color, background on the characters, hair texture and length, all of those design things.”      It takes two to three years for an idea for a character to grow from a concept to book series and doll. Melody’s series of books was completed in January, and the doll will be released in late summer or autumn. She is the seventh character that Speltz has worked on.      He’s been surprised at the amount of publicity Melody has received. That could be because her setting and time period are so compelling. The civil rights movement outside of the South is largely ignored in school curriculums.      “Many, many roots of problems in Milwaukee and Chicago and many urban, northern and western cities are related to race,” Speltz said. “It’s decades upon decades of people doing the same things: protesting at schools, sitting in on lunch counters, demonstrating outside of stores so they could be hired – many of the exact same southern things were taking place in northern communities.” ||||| ‘s ultra-high net worth group is seeking expertise from an unlikely place: American Girl Brands.

Problem:For the third straight week, the game got off to an ominous start for the Jets, as Chad Pennington was intercepted by Brian Williams on the Jets' first possession. Byron Leftwich then completed a short pass to Fred Taylor, who turned it into a 32-yard gain. Two plays later, Maurice Jones-Drew scored on a 6-yard touchdown run. After forcing a punt, Jacksonville wasted no time tacking onto their lead, with Leftwich completing passes to Reggie Williams and George Wrighster for long gains. Taylor would then score on a 13-yard touchdown run for a 14-0 Jaguars lead. Early in the second quarter, the Jets attempted a punt, but the Jaguars' Gerald Sensabaugh blocked it, and Jorge Cordova recovered at the Jets' 8-yard line. Three plays later, Jones-Drew scored on a 4-yard touchdown run, surviving a challenge by the Jets. It only snowballed from there, as Pennington was intercepted by Terry Cousin on the next possession, and Leftwich flipped a 1-yard touchdown pass to Wrighster. Jacksonville would add a Josh Scobee 43-yard field goal early in the second half, and after Deon Grant intercepted Pennington, Leftwich threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Williams for a 38-0 lead. The Jets' lone scoring chance in the second half was stopped when Leon Washington was stuffed on a 4th-and-goal from the Jaguars' 1-yard line early in the fourth quarter. The Jets were stopped on fourth down on their next possession when Pennington's scramble fell a yard short, and Scobee added a 40-yard field goal to close the scoring. On the Jets' final possession, backup rookie quarterback Kellen Clemens made his first appearance under center, but the drive ended badly when he was sacked by Montavious Stanley and Nick Greisen recovered.

One of these, a small experimental hydroponics research station on Saturn's third moon, is run solely by Adam (Douglas) and his colleague and lover Alex (Fawcett). Adam, the younger Alex and their dog Sally enjoy their isolation, far from an overcrowded and troubled Earth. The couple have been on Saturn 3 for three years, but Alex has spent all her life in space. Alex and Adam's idyll is broken by the arrival of Captain Benson (Keitel), who has been sent to Saturn 3 as part of a project to replace at least one of the moon's scientists with a robot. Benson assembles the robot and names him Hector. One of the first of its kind, a \\"Demigod Series\\", Hector relies on \\"pure brain tissue\\" extracted from human fetuses and programmed using a direct link to Benson's brain. Benson states that it will render one of the crew \\"obsolete\\", most likely Major Adam who tells his partner that he is close to \\"abort time\\" according to the government on Earth. Unknown to both Alex and Adam, Benson is a homicidal sociopath who murdered the captain originally assigned to Saturn 3 and took his place on the mission. Benson had actually failed a crucial test of psychological stability. As Benson uses the link to his brain to program the robot, Hector acquires Benson's homicidal nature and his lust for Alex. Hector initially kills Sally the dog and then assaults Benson, having learned about Benson being a murderer during the reprogramming process. Adam and Alex manage to disable the robot while it is recharging. Believing the danger over, Adam accuses Benson of gross incompetence and orders him to dismantle the robot and return to Earth when an eclipse ends. Benson obliges, but Hector is soon reassembled by the base's older robots. Resuscitated, Hector murders Benson while he is dragging Alex to his ship. Hector then blows up Benson's spacecraft before Adam and Alex can escape in it, trapping them all on...

Add the coefficients of the q terms: -1232 + (-534) + 541 = -1225 So the combined terms become -1225*q Step 3: Update the equation. Now, we put the combined term back into the equation and get the following result: 9922 = -1225*q - 4778 Step 4: Isolate the variable q. To isolate q, we first move the constant term to the other side of the equation. We do this by adding 4778 to both sides of the equation: 9922 + 4778 = -1225*q 14700 = -1225*q Step 5: Solve for the variable q. Now, we divide both sides of the equation by -1225 to solve for q: 14700 / -1225 = (-1225 * q) / -1225 q = -12 So the solution to the equation is q = -12."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an in-depth analysis of the review based on these factors: 1. Content: The review \\"Akhil Nice\\" consists of two words, the first being a name (Akhil) and the second being a simple descriptor (Nice). While it is positive in tone, the review lacks detail and specifics about the subject. It does not offer enough information for readers to understand why the reviewer has a positive impression or what they found particularly \\"nice\\" about the subject. This severely limits the review's usefulness. 2. Context: Without further information about the context, it is challenging to determine the reviewer's intention and the subject of the review. Given this lack of context, the review's relevance cannot be easily ascertained, making it difficult for potential readers to benefit from it. 3. Clarity: The review's brevity leaves it open to interpretation since the word \\"nice\\" is a relatively vague term that can refer to several aspects of a subject. The lack of elaboration on the reviewer's experience or opinions creates uncertainty for readers. 4. Relevance: In a world where reviews serve as an essential resource for making informed decisions, the relevance of a review hinges on its ability to provide clear, specific, and helpful information. The two-word review \\"Akhil Nice\\" does not offer much value to readers due to its lack of detail and context. 5. Impact: Lastly, the potential impact of this review is limited by the factors previously discussed. Due to its ambiguities and lack of detail, it is unlikely to sway readers' opinions or decisions regarding the subject. Taking these factors into account, I would rate the review \\"Akhil Nice\\" a 2 out of 5. While it has a positive connotation, it does not provide enough information to be beneficial or valuable for readers. A more comprehensive and informative review would include details about the reviewer's experience and specific reasons for their positive impression, which would be more helpful to potential readers and ultimately result in a higher rating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Roma captain Francesco Totti set a new Serie A scoring record on Saturday as his side demolished Cesena 5-1. Two early goals from the 35-year-old striker saw him reach a total of 211 goals for Roma, which means he has scored more goals for one club than any other player in Serie A history. His tally sees him surpass the previous record of 210 set by the prolific Swedish striker Gunnar Nordahl who played for AC Milan in the 1950s. \\"It's what I've always wanted, to wear this shirt and beat one record after another,\\" said Totti, AFP reported. \\"I've overtaken Nordahl and I'm proud of that. Now I'm aiming for Altafini,\\" he added, AFP reported. Brazilian Jose Altafini is the joint third highest scorer (along with Giuseppe Meazza) in Serie A history with 216 goals.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Lissitzky was born on November 23, 1890 in Pochinok, a small Jewish community 50 kilometres (31 mi) southeast of Smolensk, former Russian Empire. During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic...

Whenever a game was on, anytime at all - Taps was there on the sidelines, keeping score, and recording how each player was doing. His work was like keeping count of your candy on Halloween night! One day, on September 30, something very sad happened. During a football game, a player accidentally ran into Taps on the side of the field and he fell to the ground. Unfortunately, this caused a very bad injury to his brain. Just like how if you drop an egg, it could crack really badly and can't be put back together, Taps couldn't recover from this injury either.  After 10 days, Taps passed away. This made everyone really sad, especially the students and players he always talked to and helped. Especially the people at his school in Pennsylvania. When the principal heard what happened, he wrote a sad letter to all the parents telling them about Taps. Taps was a very special person who gave a lot of his time to everyone. Their former football coach, Coach Nick, told a newspaper named The Scranton Times-Tribune how Taps would even ride the bus with the players to away games. Then, after the games, he would happily share all the statistics he kept throughout the game. I think that would make the ride back home much more fun and interesting, don't you? Even after he retired as a teacher last year, when he was 66, Taps didn’t stop keeping scores at the high school games. He just loved it so much! People also loved having him around. Taps was not just a teacher or a statistician, he was also a husband and a dad to two children. His passing is a big loss to many people. Just like what happens in sports when a team loses a very good player, his school and his family will miss him a lot. But they will always remember the happy times they spent together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It tells the amazing stories of two sisters, both who earned devotion and respect working well into their 70's as a teacher and a dentist, then lived another 30 years with dignity. Ruby Dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as the rebellious \\"blacker\\" Bessie, the dentist. She not only expresses her anger, angst, and wisdom well; she lets you know exactly where they've come from using an economy of words. Diahnn Carroll has the feel of the older sister, the teacher, down perfectly, but I'm afraid she never makes me believe that she's over 100. No matter -- the stories are well worth telling. Amy Madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the movie as the Caucasian NY Times reporter. This, too, is only a minor distraction. The stories, all true, are the attraction and although two or three get slightly damaged in the translation, most of them make it through just fine. I recommend the book as essential reading to all people I recommend any books to. I cannot quite but this TV-movie in that rarefied air, but it certainly captures enough of the flavor to be highly worthwhile in its own right.

In which year did the Easter Rising, against British rule in Ireland, take place?","output":"The Easter Rising, also known as the Easter Rebellion, took place in the year 1916. The event marked a significant turning point in the long-standing struggle for Irish independence from British rule. The uprising occurred during Easter Week, starting on April 24 and lasting until April 29, 1916. It was orchestrated mainly by the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), a secret revolutionary organization, as well as the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, both paramilitary groups. The leaders of the Easter Rising included individuals such as Patrick Pearse, James Connolly, and Tom Clarke, among others. The central objective of the Easter Rising was to establish an independent Irish Republic by ending centuries of British political control over Ireland. The rebels sought to accomplish this by seizing key buildings and infrastructure in Dublin and subsequently declaring independence. They managed to take control of several strategic locations, including the General Post Office (GPO), which served as their headquarters, as well as the Four Courts, and the South Dublin Union. Despite the determination of the Irish rebels, the Easter Rising ultimately failed due to several factors. The most impactful being poor planning, a lack of public support, and the overwhelming military force mobilized by the British government to quash the uprising. After a week of intense fighting and destruction throughout the city, the rebellion was brutally suppressed, with heavy casualties on both sides. In the aftermath of the uprising, the British authorities arrested thousands of people suspected of involvement, and over 90 of the rebellion's leaders and participants were executed. While the initial public opinion was mixed or even negative towards the rebels, the harsh response of the British government led to a shift in sympathy among the Irish population towards the Republican cause.  The Easter Rising can be considered an essential catalyst in the subsequent chain of events that ultimately led to the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921), the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, and the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922 as a dominion within the British Commonwealth. In time, the Irish Free State would evolve into the fully independent Republic of Ireland that exists today.  In summary, the Easter Rising took place in 1916, with the primary aim of establishing an Irish Republic separate from British rule. Though the uprising was unsuccessful, it played a significant role in shaping Irish history and the nation's eventual journey towards independence."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me.

Article: A black and white kitten with a broken back lay on animal doctor Betsy Kennon's examination table. A regular customer had rushed him to her office after his pet dog brought the cat home in his mouth. The dog's owner was horrified, believing that his pet had caused the cat's injuries. But Kennon found no teeth marks or bite wounds, which showed that the dog had probably saved, not harmed, the kitten. In Kennon's opinion, however, the cat was a hopeless case. Many doctors would have  _ such a badly hurt animal. But she couldn't be so cruel. The kitten's bright eyes and sad face had won her over. There was no way of finding his owner, so Kennon, a single woman aged 56, decided to keep him. She gave him a round of shots and fed him food mixed with medicines. He couldn't move his back legs but soon started pulling himself forward with his front legs. The doctor named him Scooter and contacted a company that makes carts for disabled animals. Scooter took to his new wheels like a natural. In no time he was able to move freely, but somewhat awkwardly, around Kennon's office, home and even her backyard. The sight of the determined Scooter was uplifting and amusing in equal measure and Kennon had to smile each time the cat entered the room. Kennon was convinced that her kitten could share his high spirits with others. So she took Scooter to the local hospital to see if he could help the patients. His first patient was an elderly woman who'd had a stroke and hadn't spoken to anyone for two days.

When someone tries to control us, we resent it. When we try to control others, they resent us. Remember you can't control what an employer thinks of you, just as he can't control what you think of him. So he is ready to give and take when being interviewed; never control the interview.

He comes off very kind and friendly, but a bit suspicious, alternating between talking to her in a warm, seductive voice and shouting insults to his fellow car passenger when he asks Arnold if he should \\"pull out the phone,\\" possibly to keep her from calling the police. Arnold tells Connie about how he has been watching her and that he knows all about her, recounting the details about her family's barbecue plans with amazing accuracy. He then starts talking about how he could be her lover. She starts to get scared and tells him to go, but he coerces her into going with him, threatening to burn down the house, while his friend remains at the house, supposedly to watch over it while they are gone., what would be the answer ?

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the names of the missionaries of Britain that the sculptures in the north represent and are identifiable by their attributes??  The sculptures on the west front at Wells include standing figures, seated figures, half-length angels and narratives in high relief. Many of the figures are life-sized or larger, and together they constitute the finest display of medieval carving in England. The figures and many of the architectural details were painted in bright colours, and the colouring scheme has been deduced from flakes of paint still adhering to some surfaces. The sculptures occupy nine architectural zones stretching horizontally across the entire west front and around the sides and the eastern returns of the towers which extend beyond the aisles. The strongly projecting buttresses have tiers of niches which contain many of the largest figures. Other large figures, including that of Christ, occupy the gable. A single figure stands in one of two later niches high on the northern tower. In 1851 the archaeologist Charles Robert Cockerell published his analysis of the iconography, numbering the nine sculptural divisions from the lowest to the highest. He defined the theme as \\"a calendar for unlearned men\\" illustrating the doctrines and history of the Christian faith, its introduction to Britain and its protection by princes and bishops. He likens the arrangement and iconography to the Te Deum.According to Cockerell, the side of the façade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each contained a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the Old Testament while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are identifiable by their attributes. In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel... The answer to this question is:","output":"The names of the missionaries of Britain that the sculptures in the north represent and are identifiable by their attributes are Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process:  - A fuel is heated in an oven - Above the oven is a tank of water that is sealed - The tank of water begins to boil above the oven - A the water boils steam is created - The steam is denser than air so it needs a place to go - The steam is forced out of the tank and into a piston - The piston moves up - The valve of the piston closes - The valve on the next piston opens - The steam fills the next piston, driving it up, and the other one down -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the steam is forced out the tank more slowly happens, how will it affect LESS power produced by the steam engine.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect on the process, both direct and indirect. Step-by-step analysis: 1. If the steam is forced out of the tank more slowly, this means that the steam's pressure and flow rate entering the piston will be reduced. 2. Due to the reduced pressure and flow rate, the force exerted on the piston will also be lessened. 3. This reduced force means that the piston will take longer time to move up, slowing down the movement of the steam engine. 4. As a consequence, the steam engine produces less power since power is the rate of doing work or, in this case, the rate at which the steam engine moves the piston against the resistance. 5. The valve of the piston will close and the valve on the next piston will open at a slower pace, further affecting the steam engine's overall performance. 6. The slower piston movement also affects other components of the steam engine system, such as the motion of the flywheel and the operation of other connected machinery. In conclusion, reducing the rate at which steam is forced out of the tank has both a direct and indirect effect on the process. It results in less power produced by the steam engine due to decreased forces exerted on the piston and a slowdown in the overall operation of the system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context_1 : XLR8R (pronounced \\"accelerator\\") is a magazine and website that covers music, culture, style, and technology. Context_2 : Elaiosomes (Greek \\"élaion\\" \\"oil\\" and \\"sóma\\" \\"body\\") are fleshy structures that are attached to the seeds of many plant species. The elaiosome is rich in lipids and proteins, and may be variously shaped. Many plants have elaiosomes that attract ants, which take the seed to their nest and feed the elaiosome to their larvae. After the larvae have consumed the elaiosome, the ants take the seed to their waste disposal area, which is rich in nutrients from the ant frass and dead bodies, where the seeds germinate. This type of seed dispersal is termed myrmecochory from the Greek \\"ant\\" (myrmex) and \\"dispersal\\" (kore). This type of symbiotic relationship appears to be mutualistic, more specifically dispersive mutualism according to Ricklefs, R.E. (2001), as the plant benefits because its seeds are dispersed to favorable germination sites, and also because it is planted (carried underground) by the ants. Context_3 : A seed bank (also seedbank or seeds bank) stores seeds to preserve genetic diversity; hence it is a type of gene bank. There are many reasons to store seeds. One reason is to have on-hand the genes that plant breeders need to increase yield, disease resistance, drought tolerance, nutritional quality, taste, etc. of plants used in agriculture (i.e., crops or domesticated species). Another reason is to forestall loss of genetic diversity in rare or imperiled plant species in an effort to conserve biodiversity ex situ. Many plants that were used centuries ago by humans are used less frequently now and seed banks offer a way to preserve that historical and cultural value. Collections of seeds stored at constant low temperature and moisture guard against loss of genetic resources that are otherwise maintained in situ or in field collections. These alternative 'living' collections can be damaged by natural disasters, outbreaks of disease or war. Seed banks are considered seed libraries and contain valuable information about evolved strategies to combat plant stress or can be used to create genetically modified versions of existing seeds. The work of seed banks spans decades and even centuries. Most seed banks are publicly funded and seeds are usually available for research that benefits the public. Context_4 : Seed (subtitled \\"Science Is Culture\\"; originally \\"Beneath the Surface\\") is an online science magazine published by Seed Media Group. The magazine looks at big ideas in science, important issues at the intersection of science and society, and the people driving global science culture. \\"Seed\\" was founded in Montreal by Adam Bly and the magazine is now headquartered in New York with bureaus around the world. May/June 2009 (Issue No. 22) was the last print issue. Content continues to be published on the website. Context_5 : In video games using procedural world generation, the map seed is a (relatively) short number or text string which is used to procedurally create the game world (\\"map\\"). This means that while the seed-unique generated map may be many megabytes big (often generated incrementally and virtually unlimited in potential size), it is possible to reset to the unmodified map, or the unmodified map can be exchanged between players, just by specifying the map seed. An example of a map seed in Minecraft is \\"-2242547518357798464\\". Map seeds are a type of random seeds.

In the series, Kira is a first-generation Coordinator, a genetically enhanced human being born of normal humans (Naturals). At the beginning of \\"Gundam SEED\\", Kira lives on the neutral space colony Heliopolis to avoid the war between the Coordinators and the Naturals, but the colony becomes involved in the war shortly thereafter. Kira is the only person within the Earth Alliancethe Naturals' military factionwho is able to effectively pilot their mobile suita type of a mecha created by them. He is forced to become a mobile suit pilot and to participate in various battles to protect his friends. Kira has also been featured in \\"Gundam SEED\\"' s direct sequel, \\"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny\\", in which he fights to stop a new war between the races' military organizations. Context_7 : Seed predation, often referred to as granivory, is a type of plant-animal interaction in which granivores (seed predators) feed on the seeds of plants as a main or exclusive food source, in many cases leaving the seeds damaged and not viable. Granivores are found across many families of vertebrates (especially mammals and birds) as well as invertebrates (mainly insects); thus, seed predation occurs in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems. Seed predation is commonly divided into two distinctive temporal categories, pre-dispersal and post-dispersal predation, which may involve different strategies and requirements and have different implications at the individual and population level. Nevertheless, regardless of timing, seed predation has great implications for plant population dynamics. To counterbalance effects of predation, plants have evolved defenses such as seed morphology (size, shape, toughness) and chemical defenses (secondary compounds such as tannins and alkaloids) to defend against their seed predators. However, as plants have adapted defenses to seed predation (e.g., chemical compounds), so have seed predators adapted to plant defenses (e.g., ability to detoxify chemical compounds). Thus, many interesting examples of coevolution arise from this dynamic relationship. Context_8 : An achene (Greek ἀ, \\"a\\", privative + χαίνειν, \\"chainein\\", to gape; also sometimes called akene and occasionally achenium or achenocarp) is a type of simple dry fruit produced by many species of flowering plants. Achenes are monocarpellate (formed from one carpel) and indehiscent (they do not open at maturity). Achenes contain a single seed that nearly fills the pericarp, but does not adhere to it. In many species, what is called the \\"seed\\" is an achene, a fruit containing the seed. The seed-like appearance is owed to the hardening of the wall of the seed-vessel, which encloses the solitary seed so closely as to seem like an outer coat. Context_9 : Emmer wheat, also known as farro especially in Italy, or hulled wheat, is a type of awned wheat. Emmer is a tetraploid (2n=4x=28 chromosomes). The domesticated species are \\"Triticum turgidum\\" subsp. \\"dicoccum\\" and \\"Triticum turgidum \\"conv.\\" durum\\". The wild species is called \\"Triticum turgidum\\" subsp. \\"dicoccoides\\". The principal difference between the wild and the domestic species is that the ripened seed head of the wild species shatters and spreads the seed onto the ground, while in the domesticated emmer, the seed head remains intact, thus making it easier for humans to harvest the grain. Context_10 : SEED is a global partnership for action on sustainable development and the green economy. It was initiated in 2001 by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB). Under the name \\"SEED Initiative\\" it was presented as an “Example of Excellence” partnership inter alia by UNEP and BMUB at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 where it was also registered by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a Type II Partnership.

Research Black Bat cigarettes. 2. Identify the key differences between Black Bat, Marlboro, and Camel cigarettes. 3. Define a \\"Black cigarette.\\" 4. Compare the meanings of the two questions to determine if they are the same. Step 1: Research Black Bat cigarettes Black Bat cigarettes are a brand of clove cigarettes originating from Indonesia. They are also known as Kreteks due to the crackling sound they make when burning. Black Bat cigarettes contain a mix of tobacco and ground cloves, giving them a unique taste and aroma. Step 2: Identify key differences between Black Bat, Marlboro, and Camel cigarettes Black Bat cigarettes differ from Marlboro and Camel cigarettes in several ways: - Flavor and aroma: Black Bat cigarettes contain cloves, which give them a distinct taste and aroma compared to traditional tobacco-only cigarettes, like Marlboro and Camel.  - Origin: Black Bat cigarettes originate from Indonesia, while Marlboro and Camel cigarettes are well-known American brands. - Composition: Kreteks, such as Black Bats, have a mix of tobacco and ground cloves, sometimes with additional spices or flavors, while Marlboro and Camel cigarettes typically only contain tobacco as their primary ingredient. Step 3: Define \\"Black cigarette\\" A \\"Black cigarette\\" is a term that could refer to any of the following: - A cigarette with a black-colored wrapper. - A cigarette with a dark, rich, or bold flavor profile. - A cigarette containing \\"black tobacco,\\" a term used to describe dark air-cured tobaccos that have been fermented. - An unconventional or slang term for a specific type of cigarette, such as Black Bat cigarettes.

Anthony is best known as the former bass player for the hard rock band Van Halen. Anthony is known for his stage antics, his effects-laden live solos, his number of custom-made bass guitars, including a Jack Daniel's model shaped like a whiskey bottle, and his background vocals in Van Halen. He also has a signature Schecter Guitar Research bass-guitar series. As early as 1996, rumors periodically surfaced that Anthony had been fired from Van Halen, despite claims to the contrary. He continued working with the band. These rumors persisted until his final departure after the 2004 reunion tour with Hagar.  Anthony's involvement in recording the 1998 album Van Halen III was dramatically less than previous albums. Anthony played bass on only three songs, with Eddie Van Halen playing the bass parts for the remainder. Anthony is credited as a songwriter for the album along with the rest of the band, as is always the case for Van Halen albums. Anthony performed with the band for the 1998 tour, and was credited on messages from the band thereafter. He participated in the band's three reunion efforts with David Lee Roth in 2000 and 2001. Anthony's name was also credited in a few band newsletters and appeared in band interviews during this time. Sometime after this, Anthony disappeared from public view until the 2004 reunion.  In interviews, Eddie and Alex Van Halen suggested they were jamming and writing/recording new material during this time period but appeared to be working without Anthony.  Anthony began periodic appearances with Sammy Hagar during his solo tours. He usually played as part of both the Waboritas and Los Tres Gusanos, two of Hagar's bands. During 2002's David Lee Roth/Sammy Hagar tour, both Michael Anthony and ex-Van Halen vocalist Gary Cherone made guest appearances at concerts, sometimes together.  In 2002, Anthony, Hagar, Neal Schon, Deen Castronovo, and Joe Satriani formed the \\"supergroup\\" Planet Us and Anthony began making more frequent performances at Sammy Hagar concerts. Planet Us recorded two songs, including \\"Psycho Vertigo,\\" which was intended for the original Spider-Man soundtrack but ultimately did not make the album.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the opera that was described as \\"the result of the general success of Socialist construction, of the correct policy of the Party\\"?, using the article: After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a..., what would be the answer ?

Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings.

Billy Joe Saunders is set to fight for the vacant WBO world middleweight title, according to the sanctioning body’s president. Saunders, who is ranked No 2 with the organisation, looked to have been overlooked after light-middleweight champion Demetrius Andrade announced his intention to move up a division. But not only will the 25-year-old from Hatfield get his opportunity, he is also likely to have home advantage against Russia’s Matvey Korobov. Billy Joe Saunders was lined up to fight Chris Eubank Jnr in London on October 25. A tweet from the World Boxing Organisation president shows that Saunders may now fight Korobov. Matvey Korobov (right) fought for Russia in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. WBO president Paco Valcarvcel tweeted: ‘Demetrius Andrade will defend WBO 154lbs title. Looks like Korobov-Saunders will take place in England for the vacant 160lbs belt.’ The title is vacant after previous champion Peter Quillin refused to face Korobov, who lives in Florida. The 31-year-old has won all 24 of his professional fights, four more than his prospective opponent. Saunders had been expected to fight bitter British rival Chris Eubank Jnr in London on October 25 but revealed last week that Eubank Jnr had not signed the contract. A deadline imposed by Saunders passed without an announcement, but it seems he will swerve the domestic dust-up for his chance of world honours.

Final Justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a Texas town named Geronimo (pronounced as Heronimo). He's an ugly, slimy, rude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas. His partner actually slumps down twice in the movie. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie, making the plot go nowhere fast. Plus, he shoots everybody like he's in the wild west.

Write a title for this article: Leah Remini isn’t letting up on her crusade against the Church of Scientology. In an upcoming appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the 46-year-old actress opens up about her stand against the Church and her new A&E docu-series about the organization, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath. “We’re doing an eight-part series and A&E is very brave to do it and the people who are speaking are very brave to do it because they’re repercussions to speaking out,” Remini tells DeGeneres. In the docu-series, which DeGeneres called “bold and brave,” Remini interviews former members of the Church, some of whom have alleged abuse by the organization, according to Variety. The docu-series also features former Scientology officials who work alongside Remini to explore the stories. “I can’t sit back … I felt I had a responsibility to say, ‘I’m not going to allow you to bully these people who are very brave to come out and tell their stories,’ ” she told DeGeneres. “And that’s for executives, but there are just average parishioners like me who leave and speak out about what they’ve experienced — they lose their family. And so the Church goes after their family to shun their family … I’m very lucky that didn’t happen to me. My family chose me.” Since leaving the Church in 2013, Remini penned a book about her experience with the organization titled Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology. She said she received backlash as a result but, “my story pales in comparison to what happened to other people,” she told the host. “How people are bullied into silence.” She also claimed that she has been “followed” since she began speaking out about the Church. Remini has previously opened up to PEOPLE last year about her decision to leave the controversial Church, calling the change a “rebirth.” “I’ve been given a second chance at life and so has my family,” she said. In a previous statement to PEOPLE, the Church of Scientology has said about Remini, “As we said before, desperate for attention with an acting career stuck in a nearly decade-long tailspin, Leah Remini needs to move on with her life. Instead, she seeks publicity by maliciously spreading lies about the Church using the same handful of bitter zealots who were kicked out years ago for chronic dishonesty and corruption and whose false claims the Church refuted years ago, including through judicial decisions.

Movie plot title: Conan the Barbarian Movie plot: Opening narration Between the time when the oceans drank Atlantis and the rise of the sons of Aryus, there was an age undreamed-of. And unto this Conan, destined to bear the jeweled crown of Aquilonia upon a troubled brow. It is I, his chronicler, who alone can tell thee of his saga. Let me tell you of the days of high adventure.   Wizard of the Mounds[2] Conan the Barbarian is a film about a young barbarian's quest to avenge his parents' deaths. The story is set in the fictional Hyborian Age, thousands of years before the rise of modern civilization.[3] The film opens with the words, \\"That which does not kill us makes us stronger\\", a paraphrasing of Friedrich Nietzsche,[nb 1] on a black screen followed by a voice-over that establishes the film as the story of Conan's origin.[2][5] \\"A burst of drums and trumpets\\" accompanies the forging of a sword,[3][nb 2] after which the scene shifts to a mountain top, where the swordsmith tells his young son Conan about the Riddle of Steel, an aphorism on the importance of the metal to their people,[7][8] the Cimmerians.[9] The Cimmerians are massacred by a band of warriors led by Thulsa Doom. Conan's father is killed by dogs, and his sword is taken by Doom to decapitate Conan's mother. The children are taken into slavery; Conan is chained to a large mill, the Wheel of Pain. Years of pushing the huge grindstone build up his muscles. His master trains him to be a gladiator, and after winning many pit fights, Conan is freed. As he wanders the world, he encounters a witch and befriends Subotai, a thief and archer.[10][11] Following the witch's advice, Conan and Subotai go to Shadizar, in the land of Zamora, to seek out Doom.[12] They meet Valeria, a female brigand, who becomes Conan's lover. They burgle the Tower of Serpents, stealing a large jewelâthe Eye of the Serpentâand other valuables from Doom's snake cult.

Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group had more serious mutations?","output":"Determining which group exhibited more serious mutations between Group A with germline mutations and Group B with somatic mutations requires an understanding of the two types of mutations, how they affect organisms, and their long-term implications. Germline mutations occur in the germline cells, which are the reproductive cells responsible for transmitting genetic information to the next generation. These mutations can therefore be inherited, potentially leading to new variations in offspring characteristics and an impact on the future generations of organisms. Depending on the exact nature of the germline mutation, it could result in significant and lasting consequences for the progeny, including genetic disorders, a reduced capacity for survival, or consequences for the continued propagation of the species in affected populations. In contrast, somatic mutations occur in somatic cells or non-reproductive cells of an organism, and therefore do not have an impact on transmission to the future generations. These types of mutations are limited to the individual in which they occur, which means their consequences are more localized. While somatic mutations can lead to various issues, such as cellular malfunctions, abnormal cell growth, and even cancer, the effects are not heritable and will not affect the individual's offspring in most instances. Given the aspects of these two types of mutations, it is difficult to definitively state which group, A or B, had more serious mutations without additional context and specific information about the detected mutations in the two groups studied. However, if we consider the implications of both mutations on a long-term scale, germline mutations generally carry a higher degree of seriousness as they have the potential to be inherited and persistently impact future generations. In contrast, somatic mutations are individually constrained and often do not have the same extent of consequences that germline mutations may present. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Group A with germline mutations might have experienced more serious mutations due to their potential heritability and long-term implications for the fruit fly populations. Nevertheless, it is crucial to assess the specifics of each mutation in order to wholly understand the severity and the relative risks associated with both germline and somatic mutations in the context of this study."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the release that marked a change in Metallica's musical direction? is inside the article: After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Tombstone Context: Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), a retired peace officer with a notable reputation, reunites with his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) in Tucson, Arizona, where they venture on towards Tombstone, a small mining town, to settle down. There they encounter Wyatt's long-time friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), a Southern gambler and expert gunslinger, who seeks relief from his worsening tuberculosis. Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany) and Mr. Fabian (Billy Zane) are also newly arrived in Tombstone with a traveling theater troupe. Meanwhile, Wyatt's common-law wife, Mattie Blaylock (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), is becoming dependent on a potent narcotic. Wyatt and his brothers begin to profit from a stake in a gambling emporium and saloon when they have their first encounter with a band of outlaws called the Cowboys, led by \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocious (Powers Boothe). The Cowboys are identifiable by the red sashes worn around their waist. Wyatt, though no longer a lawman, is pressured to help rid the town of the Cowboys as tensions rise. Curly Bill begins shooting aimlessly after a visit to an opium house and is approached by Marshal Fred White (Harry Carey, Jr.) to relinquish his firearms. Curly Bill instead shoots the marshal dead and is forcibly taken into custody by Wyatt. The arrest infuriates Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) and the other Cowboys. Curly Bill stands trial, but is found not guilty due to a lack of witnesses. Virgil, unable to tolerate lawlessness, becomes the new marshal and imposes a weapons ban within the city limits. This leads to the legendary Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in which Billy Clanton (Thomas Haden Church) and other Cowboys are killed. Virgil and Morgan are wounded, and the allegiance of county sheriff Johnny Behan (Jon Tenney) with the Cowboys is made clear. As retribution for the Cowboy deaths, Wyatt's brothers are ambushed; Morgan is killed, while Virgil is left handicapped. A despondent Wyatt and his family leave Tombstone and board a train, with Clanton and Frank Stilwell close...

Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!  I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift.

The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama  Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of  Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.

Summarize this article: Sources tell Mediaite Keith Olbermann and MSNBC were headed for a breakup long before Comcast’s rise to power, but clearly something set the divorce into motion quickly today, with network promos set to run touting Olbermann’s role in MSNBC’s coverage of next week’s State of the Union address–and, notably, a Keith Olbermann promo running on MSNBC in the hour after the host signed off and left the network.      MSNBC executives have long planned for the day the network’s star might be sent packing, and the rise of Rachel Maddow at MSNBC–along with the grooming of Lawrence O’Donnell as a potential replacement for Olbermann–appears to have hastened the host’s departure.            While Olbermann and his iconic Countdown have been immensely important in the resurgence of MSNBC, Olbermann’s friction with management has been a sticking point. At many points–including the recent suspension over political contributions–tensions rose so high as to lead to serious discussions inside MSNBC about firing their star.      With Maddow enjoying both immense popularity inside MSNBC and very strong ratings for her Rachel Maddow Show, Olbermann’s invincibility as the heart and soul of MSNBC’s brand became softer. In recent weeks, sources tell Mediaite there have been meetings on the topic of Keith Olbermann and his future at the network. Did Comcast–as many Countdown viewers seem to suspect–order Olbermann out? It appears that the end of the Olbermann era at MSNBC was not “ordered” by Comcast, nor was it a move to tone down the network’s politics. Instead, sources inside the network say it came down to the more mundane world of office politics–Olbermann was a difficult employee, who clashed with bosses, colleagues and underlings alike, and with the Comcast-related departure of Jeff Zucker, and the rise of Maddow and O’Donnell, the landscape shifted, making an Olbermann exit suddenly seem well-timed.      The blunt, brief statement of Olbermann’s final day, compared to the long, lush programming memo that makes no mention of Olbermann suggests that while the timing may not have been set, the foundation had been laid for today’s move.      Update: Brian Stelter reports the following statement from Comcast:      “Comcast has not closed the transaction for NBCU and has no operational control at any of its properties including MSNBC. We pledged from the day the deal was announced that we would not interfere with NBCU’s news operations. We have not & we will not.”      Watch Olbermann’s Sign-off below:      Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| Keith Olbermann took an unexpected bow from MSNBC on Friday, announcing on air in the last 10 minutes of his show that it would be his final episode of “Countdown.”      The departure was a stealth move, MSNBC insiders told POLITICO, with many top executives and on-air personalities kept out of the loop as the decision was made. It came, one insider said, “Out of the … blue!”      Text Size -      +      reset VIDEO: Olbermann's sign off POLITICO 44      “This will be the last edition of ‘Countdown’,” Olbermann said at about 8:50 as he led into his final commercial break. “I will explain that, next.”      Neither MSNBC nor Olbermann offered a reason for the departure, but several sources close to the situation said its roots lay in Olbermann’s defiant reaction to being suspended after POLITICO discovered that he had donated to Democratic candidates without telling his bosses.      Although Olbermann’s political leanings were quite clear, the move violated NBC policy, and Olbermann’s response angered NBC News President Steve Capus in particular, according to former MSNBC anchor David Shuster.      “It’s no secret that Steve was particularly upset – justifiably so – with how he handled the suspension,” he said in an interview with Anderson Cooper.      On air, Olbermann hinted that he had just learned of the end of his show Friday, and suggested his departure was not voluntary. “I think the same fantasy popped into the head of everybody in my business who has ever been told what I have been told: this will be the last edition of your show,” he said.      “You go to the scene from the movie ‘Network,’ complete with the pajamas and the raincoat, and go off on a verbal journey of unutterable vision and you insist upon Peter Finch’s gutteral resonance and you will the viewer to go to the window, open it, stick out his head and yell,” he continued. “You know the rest. In the mundane world of television goodbyes, reality is laughably uncooperative.”      “Good night and good luck,” he said, quoting Edward R. Murrow, as he signed off for a final time.      Olbermann had two years left on the four-year, 30 million contract he signed in 2008. Insiders said discussions about his departure had been going on for some time.      The end of Olbermann’s contract coincided with the departure of NBC Universal chief executive Jeff Zucker, three days after Comcast’s takeover of a majority share in the company was approved by the U.S. government.      Cooper opened his CNN show with the story, noting that the move was so sudden that some at MSNBC didn’t appear to get the memo as promos for this show were still airing after his final signoff.      He said his sources blamed the fallout from the merger and Zucker’s departure. Zucker was widely viewed as Olbermann’s “protector,” as Cooper put it.      But MSNBC rejected this reading.      “Comcast had nothing to do with this decision,” said MSNBC spokesman Jeremy Gaines. “They were informed this week following regulatory approval.”      Comcast distanced itself from any notion that it had something to do with the decision, releasing a midnight statement saying it had not yet closed its transaction with NBC Universal and so does not yet have operational control.      “We pledged from the day the deal was announced that we would not interfere with NBCU’s news operations. We have not and we will not.” ||||| Cable host Keith Olbermann and news channel MSNBC abruptly parted ways on Friday night, as the network announced it had agreed to end his contract and the last installment of his show would air that evening.      The surprise announcement strips MSNBC of its most-watched evening anchor after an increasingly tempestuous relationship, coming less than three months after the network briefly suspended the fiery host.      Enlarge Image Close MSNBC A shot from Keith Olbermann's last episode on Friday.      \\"MSNBC thanks Keith for his integral role in MSNBC's success and we wish him well in his future endeavors,\\" the network said in an emailed statement just before the end of Mr. Olbermann's Friday program.      MSNBC and Mr. Olbermann have been discussing parting ways for some time, according to a person familiar with the matter. That person said they ultimately came to a financial agreement to end his contract two years early. The host signed a four-year deal worth 30 million in 2008.      Neither side offered an explanation for their split. On the air, Mr. Olbermann said it would be his last show, and thanked viewers.      The quick change Friday set off a game of musical chairs, as MSNBC moved to fill the hole \\"Countdown with Keith Olbermann\\" will leave behind. The network said its 10 p.m. host Lawrence O'Donnell would move into Mr. Olbermann's slot 8 p.m. slot beginning on Monday.      Meanwhile radio host Ed Schultz, who has hosted a 6 p.m. show on MSNBC since 2009, will take over Mr. O'Donnell's 10 p.m. time slot.      Executives have said tensions between Mr. Olbermann and the network have been running high since their spat in November, when the host was suspended for making three donations to Democratic candidates without seeking approval beforehand. One of them was U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who faced a tough re-election battle at the time, and narrowly survived an alleged assassination attempt earlier this month.      Mr. Olbermann missed two broadcasts during his suspension. MSNBC asked Mr. Olbermann to make a public apology for running afoul of its ethics rules before reinstating him, according to another person familiar with the matter. But Mr. Olbermann resisted so long as MSNBC kept him suspended, the person said.      After MSNBC lifted its suspension, Mr. Olbermann released a statement apologizing to viewers. But at least some senior executives and others at the network remained angry over Mr. Olbermann's behavior, before and during the affair, a person familiar with their thinking said at the time.      Mr. Olbermann made his debut on \\"Countdown\\" in 2003 and quickly became the face of MSNBC's more liberal tilt in its evening hours. Along with fellow host Rachel Maddow, he helped catapult MSNBC ahead of Time Warner Inc.'s CNN in the size of its primetime audience.      Mr. Olbermann averaged 1 million viewers in 2010 in the 8 p.m. hour, according to Nielsen Co. figures from MSNBC, a distant second to Fox News's Bill O'Reilly, but nearly double what CNN averaged against him in the hour. (News Corp. owns both Fox News and the Wall Street Journal.)      Mr. Olbermann's exit comes on the eve of Comcast Corp.'s takeover of network parent NBC Universal, in a deal that received regulatory approval in Washington earlier this week.      An MSNBC spokesman said that Comcast was informed of the decision, but not involved in making it.      A Comcast spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that the cable giant currently has \\"no operational control\\" at MSNBC, adding, \\"We pledged from the day the deal was announced that we would not interfere with NBC Universal's news operations. We have not and we will not.\\"      Write to Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.com ||||| Cable news channel MSNBC ended its turbulent relationship with its most-popular anchor, Keith Olbermann , with a terse statement saying that Friday night's show was his last.In a six-minute farewell sign-off at the end of \\" Countdown with Keith Olbermann ,\\" the forceful liberal commentator didn't volunteer a reason for his abrupt departure from the channel that became an ideological counterbalance to the rival Fox News Channel The only hint Olbermann offered for his exit was an admission that over the last couple of years there were \\"many occasions\\" when the noise and heat surrounding the show \\"was just too much for me.\\" But, he added, it was a supportive, unwearying audience that \\"required that I keep going.\\"Although Olbermann's last broadcast came without warning, tension between the network and the former sports broadcaster — early in his career he appeared on KTLA -TV and KCBS-TV in Los Angeles — had been building for some time.

He did not indicate where he might be headed, although a person familiar with his exit agreement said it prevents him from turning up on a competing channel for about a year.Late Friday, the founder and chief executive of the liberal-leaning Media Matters for America, David Brock, saluted Olbermann, saying \\"for nearly eight years, 'Countdown with Keith Olbermann' led the charge against conservative misinformation in prime time.\\" |||||","output":"Some people at MSNBC wanted Keith Olbermann, a big news anchor, to leave the network because he wasn't easy to work with.

There is about 4 or 5 different little episodes. The only reason I rated it a 4 & no a 5 is that there is a few little commericals & some other little cat puppet that comes on b/t episodes. Maybe this is a plus so it looks like they are on tv. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review can be characterized as leaning more towards positive, with a few minor negative aspects pointed out by the reviewer. The title, \\"Good for any 3 yr old,\\" immediately sets a positive tone, as the reviewer is giving a recommendation for a specific age group that would likely enjoy the product. The reviewer also states that the DVD is a good choice for any Caillou fan, which further adds to the positive tone. In the detailed description of the review, the reviewer shares that they bought the DVD from Amazon for their 3-year-old son after not finding it in stores, which implies that they went through extra effort to provide this particular product to their child – a situation which could hint at a positive outcome. They also point out that there are about 4 or 5 different little episodes on the DVD, providing some variety to the content. However, the reviewer does mention a reason for giving the product 4 stars instead of 5: the inclusion of a few little commercials and the appearance of another cat puppet character in between episodes. While the reviewer doesn't explicitly state these aspects as negative, they do cause the reviewer to slightly reduce their overall rating of the product. The reviewer does suggest that the commercials and the cat puppet may be a plus for some viewers who want the content to resemble an authentic television show. Given this information, it can be concluded that the overall tone of the review is more positive than negative, as the reviewer recommends the DVD for 3-year-old Caillou fans and gives it a rating of 4 stars. The few negative aspects mentioned do not detract significantly from the overall positive tone of the review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: Why is the narrator so fond of the gift ?","output":"The narrator is so fond of the gift primarily because of the emotional connection and thoughtfulness attached to it, as evidenced by the different factors mentioned in the text. Firstly, the gift has a personal touch, as it was carefully picked out by the narrator. It is this consideration behind the selection of the gift that makes it special and unique to the recipient. The fact that the narrator took the time and effort to choose something that they thought would be perfect for their friend demonstrates a deep sense of care and understanding of the recipient's preferences. Secondly, the recipient's reaction to the gift adds further value to it. He positively appreciates the gift and acknowledges the significance of the narrator's choice by stating that it would be his favorite smell since the narrator picked it out. This genuine appreciation from the recipient solidifies the connection between the two individuals and emphasizes the impact of the thoughtfulness behind the gift. Thirdly, the narrator highlights two potential aspects of the gift that the recipient might love – the special note or letter included with the gift. These notes or letters represent an additional layer of sentiment, as they are likely to contain personal messages and expressions of affection from the narrator to the recipient. Such messages add emotional significance to the gift, as they illustrate the depth of the bond shared between the two individuals. Ultimately, the narrator's fondness for the gift stems from the combination of the thought and effort they invested in selecting it and the genuine appreciation and acknowledgement it received from the recipient. The emotional significance and connection shared between these two individuals are heightened by the inclusion of a special note or letter with the gift, which reflects their bond and personal understanding of one another. In conclusion, the reason why the narrator is so fond of the gift is primarily due to the emotional connection, thoughtfulness, and love embedded in the entire process of gifting – from selecting the perfect item to the appreciation and feedback received from the recipient. By combining these elements, the gift transcends its mere material value and becomes a symbol of the affectionate bond, understanding, and care shared between these two individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

What would be the tax benefit if I purchased a health insurance policy for Rs. 2,00,000? Options:  A). no;  B). yes;","output":"A). No.  These two questions have different meanings and focus on separate aspects of health insurance. Let me provide a detailed explanation for each question to clarify their distinct meanings. 1. How do you find your health insurance policy number? This question is primarily focused on the process of locating and identifying a specific piece of information related to your health insurance coverage, namely, the policy number. A health insurance policy number is a unique identifier assigned to an individual's health insurance policy. It is essential when seeking medical treatment, filing claims, or communicating with the insurer regarding covered benefits or services. To find your health insurance policy number, you can try the following methods: a. Check your health insurance card: The policy number is often printed on the front side of your insurance card. It might be labeled as \\"Policy Number,\\" \\"Member ID,\\" or a similar term. b. Review your policy documents: Upon purchasing health insurance, you should receive a document outlining the details, terms, and conditions of your policy. The policy number should be mentioned in these documents as well. c. Contact your insurer: If you cannot find your policy number through the above methods, you can contact your insurance company's customer service department, and they should be able to assist you in locating your policy number. 2. What would be the tax benefit if I purchased a health insurance policy for Rs. 2,00,000? This question focuses specifically on the intersection of taxation and health insurance, particularly on the potential tax benefits or deductions available when purchasing a health insurance policy. In this case, the policy's value is mentioned as Rs. 2,00,000, which is likely the annual premium paid by the individual. The tax benefits associated with purchasing a health insurance policy depend on the tax laws and regulations in the specific country where the policyholder resides. Generally, individuals can claim deductions or tax credits for the premiums paid towards health insurance policies under certain conditions. The exact amount of tax benefit or deduction available may depend on factors such as: a. Age: In some countries, tax benefits increase with age, allowing older individuals to claim more significant deductions. b. Number of dependents: Having more family members or dependents under a health insurance policy sometimes allows for higher deductions. c. Income level: High-income earners may have access to different tax benefits compared to lower-income earners. d. Type of policy: Some tax benefits may differ between individual and family policies or based on the policy's specific terms.

(July 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) After she is administered the drug pentothal by psychiatrists Dr. Erik Lorimer (Bruce Bennett) and Dr. Wayne McGregor (Douglas Kennedy), nurse Jane Marvin (Beverly Garland) recalls a series events from her forgotten past when she was known as Joyce Webster. Joyce has just married a young man named Paul Webster (Richard Crane). Aboard their honeymoon train, Paul receives a telegram and, in a panic, immediately leaves the train to make a phone call. When the train pulls out, Paul is missing, having vanished without a word to Joyce. Throughout the following months, Joyce employs private detectives and conducts her own search for her husband to no avail, until one day, she discovers the address of the Cypresses Plantation that Paul entered on his college enrollment forms. Joyce takes the next train to the desolate whistle-stop town of Bayou Landing in the heart of Louisiana swamp country. While waiting forlornly at the rail station, she notices a large crate marked to be containing radioactive cobalt. Surmising no one would leave such cargo alone long, she stays by it and meets Mannon (Lon Chaney Jr.), a handyman at the Cypresses who came to pick up the cobalt. She asks him to drive her there and he obliges. As they proceed deeper in the swamps, Joyce is horrified when Mannon tries to run over an alligator and then exhibits the hook where a gator bit off his hand. At the plantation, Joyce introduces herself to Lavinia Hawthorne (Frieda Inescort), the Cypressesâ stern mistress. When Joyce suggests that Paul once lived at the plantation, Lavinia bristles and calls her a liar and tries to have her thrown out. However, when her manservant Tobee (Vince Townsend Jr.) points out Joyce has missed the last train back to town, Lavinia reluctantly invites her to stay the night under the proviso that she not...

The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice. Because the Church hadn't given the mission money for rice in over a year, \\"the faith left them when the rice gave out.\\" Francis rents a small room in the city to evangelize, but because he has no money or influence, he is attacked by those same \\"rice Christians\\" who were supposed to help...

The proud and happy mother feels the first signs of life kicking inside her body. And that same life------many years later------ comes to its end in a widely-used expression, to kick the bucket( ) .  The expression to kick the bucket is almost 200 years old.  One belief is that it started when an English stableman  killed himself by hanging  while standing on a bucket. He put a rope around his neck and tied it to a beam  in the ceiling, and then kicked the bucket away from under him. Another old expression that comes from England is to kick over the traces. Traces were the chains  that held at horse or mule to a wagon or plow. Sometimes, an animal refused to obey and kicked over the traces. Kick around is an expression that is heard often in American English. A person who is kicked around is someone who is treated badly. Usually he is not really being kicked by somebody's foot. He is just not being treated with the respect that all of us want. A person who has kicked around for most of his life is someone who has spent his life moving from place to place. In this case, kicking around means moving often from one place to another. Kick around has another meaning when you use it with the word idea. When you kick around an idea, you are giving that idea some thought. There is no physical action when you kick a person upstairs, although the pain can be as strong .You kick a person upstairs by removing him from an important job and giving him a job that sounds more important, but really is not. Still another meaning of the word kick is to free oneself of a bad habit, such as smoking cigarettes. Health campaigns urge smokers to kick the habit.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: About 97% of the world's water is salty and is found in our oceans and seas. But, as we can't drink seawater, how can it be important? Every part of our seas and oceans contains an amazing number of animals and fish that live at different ocean depths. Most of the different species of animals and fish depend on simple plants for their food. These simple plants called algae   drift near the surface of the ocean and use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into food and oxygen. In fact, algae produce over half of the oxygen people breathe. How important seawater is! Each plant or animal in our seas and oceans is an important link in a food chain. The algae are eaten in large amounts by microscopic animals, which are in turn consumed by larger animals. These food chains are delicately balanced. The bad news about the food chains in the oceans is that they are under threat because of man. People once thought that the oceans were so big that it didn't matter if we dumped rubbish into them or caught huge quantities of fish and whales for food. But we now know this is not true and fish stocks in the oceans have started to drop. Thankfully, the world is taking steps to protect the future of our oceans by introducing international agreements to protect marine habitats. Most countries have introduced fishing restrictions to protect fish stocks in the oceans and new techniques are being pioneered to cope with pollution. Finally, the importance of protecting oceans is being made known to more people. This is just the beginning of a long process to protect the oceans for our future. We depend on the oceans for fish which are an important part of the human diet. How important seawater is! Question: Which of the following is NOT a way being used to protect oceans?

Article: It is one of the most annoying words in the English language and it seems there is no escaping it. The word \\"huh?\\" is in worldwide use, a study found. Researchers discovered that languages spoken in countries from Ghana and Laos to Iceland and Italy all include \\"huh?\\", or something that sounds very like it. They said that while the study may sound silly, the word is an absolutely necessary part of speech. Without it and similar words, it would be impossible to show that we haven't heard or understood what had been said and this would lead to constant misunderstandings. But while other words used in the same context, such as \\"sorry\\" or \\"what\\", vary widely across languages, \\"huh?\\" remains unchanged. The Dutch researchers carefully studied ten languages from around the world, including Siwu, which is spoken in Ghana, and an Australian Aboriginal language, as well as Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Mandarin Chinese. They analysed tapes of recorded conversations for words that sounded like \\"huh?\\" and were used to request that whatever had just been said be repeated. All contained a version of \\"huh?\\". The word was also found in another 21 languages. While there were subtle differences in each country, all sounded basically the same. This is surprising because normally unrelated languages will use very different words to describe the same thing. For instance, the Japanese for \\"dog\\" is \\"inu\\", while the French is \\"chien\\". It is thought that languages around the world have developed their own version of \\"huh?\\" because the sound is quick and simple to form, as well as being easily understood. The researchers, said that it might seem unimportant to carry out scientific research into a word like \\"huh?\\" but in fact this little word is an essential tool in human communication. They also have an answer for those who claim that \\"huh?\\" isn't a word. They say that it qualifies because of the small differences in its pronunciation in different languages. It also can be considered a word because it's something we learn to say, rather... Question: According to researchers, the word \\"huh?\\" is very important in speech because of   _  .

Around the beginning of the 20th century, William James (1842–1910) coined the term \\"radical empiricism\\" to describe an offshoot of his form of pragmatism, which he argued could be dealt with separately from his pragmatism – though in fact the two concepts are intertwined in James's published lectures. James maintained that the empirically observed \\"directly apprehended universe needs ... no extraneous trans-empirical connective support\\", by which he meant to rule out the perception that there can be any value added by seeking supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. James's \\"radical empiricism\\" is thus not radical in the context of the term \\"empiricism\\", but is instead fairly consistent with the modern use of the term \\"empirical\\".

The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah-To-Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection . Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried . The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb . They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid , a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud . Sir Basil is bitten by a snake just after finding the tomb . He recovers , but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo . Preston takes advantage of this and commits him to an insane asylum , to take credit for finding the tomb and Prince 's mummy himself .

If you're looking at a tree in the shape of a bear, it's a topiary  . A topiary is a tree or bush   that is trained into a shape. Growing a topiary garden takes both time and skills. A topiary gardener should make a drawing first. The drawing shows the final shape that the gardener likes. The gardener then chooses a bush for the topiary. It may be one that just planted or one that is already in place. In June of the plant's first year, the gardener looks for new leaves. When the leaves grow, it's time to shape the bottom of the bush. It needs about five years. The top is not _ during this time. In the fifth year, the bush grows tall enough for shaping. Then the gardener begins to shape the whole bush. Once a topiary has been started, it needs care all year. In the summer it must be cut many times to keep its shape. This cutting also helps the bush grow. In the winter the bushes don't grow. The gardeners have to brush snow off the plants, or snow may hurt some parts of them. Topiary gardening is a very old art. The Romans did it in the first century.

When found to be made of a material unknown on Earth, the spool is circumstantially linked to the Tunguska explosion of 1908. The spool is seized on as evidence that the explosion, originally blamed on a meteor, was actually caused by an alien spaceship. Professor Harringway deduces the craft must have come from Venus. The spool itself is determined to be a flight recorder and is partially decoded by an international team of scientists led by Professor Sikarna and Dr. Tchen Yu. When radio greetings sent to Venus go unanswered, Harringway announces that a journey to Venus is the only alternative. The recently completed Soviet spaceship Cosmostrator intended to voyage to Mars, is redirected to Venus, a 30- to 31-day journey. During the voyage, Sikarna works furiously to translate the alien message using the spaceship's computer. When their spaceship nears Venus, radio interference from the planet cuts the crew off from Earth. By then, Sikarna's efforts lead to a stunning discovery: The spool describes a Venusian plan to irradiate the Earth's surface, with the extermination of mankind being the prelude to an invasion. Rather than containing a \\"cosmic document\\", as had been expected, the spool bears a cold-blooded message of destruction. Harringway convinces the crew to press on towards Venus rather than return to Earth with news that would panic mankind. With the ship's robot, Omega, American astronaut Brinkman pilots a one-man landing craft. On the ground, he encounters an industrial complex and finds small recording devices that look like insects. The rest of the crew follows when Cosmostrator lands, but they find no Venusian life forms.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Moss was born in London, son of Alfred Moss, a dentist of Bray, Berkshire, and Aileen (nee Craufurd). He was brought up at Long White Cloud house on the right bank of the River Thames. His father was an amateur racing driver who had placed 16th at the 1924 Indianapolis 500. Stirling was a gifted horse rider as was his younger sister, Pat Moss, who became a successful rally driver and married Erik Carlsson. During his driving career, Moss was one of the most recognised celebrities in Britain, leading to many media appearances. In March 1958, Moss was a guest challenger on the TV panel show What's My Line? (episode with Anita Ekberg). In 1959 he was the subject of the TV programme This Is Your Life. On June 12 the following year he was interviewed by John Freeman on Face to Face; Freeman later said that he had thought before the interview that Moss was a playboy, but in their meeting he showed \\"cold, precise, clinical judgement... a man who could live so close to the edge of death and danger, and trust entirely to his own judgement. This appealed to me\\". Moss also appeared as himself in the 1964 film The Beauty Jungle, and was one of several celebrities with cameo appearances in the 1967 version of the James Bond film Casino Royale. He played Evelyn Tremble's (Peter Sellers) driver.  For many years during and after his career, the rhetorical phrase \\"Who do you think you are, Stirling Moss?\\" was supposedly the standard question all British policemen asked speeding motorists. Moss relates he himself was once stopped for speeding and asked just that; he reports the traffic officer had some difficulty believing him. As related in the book The Life and Times of Private Eye, Moss was the subject of a less than respectful cartoon biography in the magazine Private Eye. The cartoon, drawn by Willie Rushton, showed him continually crashing, having his driving licence revoked and finally \\"hosting television programmes on subjects he knows nothing about\\". It also made reference to the amnesia Moss suffered from as a result of head injuries sustained in the crash at Goodwood in 1962. According to the book, Moss responded by offering to buy the original of the cartoon, an outcome the book describes as \\"depressingly common\\" for its satirical cartoons about famous people.  Moss is the narrator of the popular children's series Roary the Racing Car which stars Peter Kay, a role he took on, having been approached by both David Jenkins, who had the original idea, and Keith Chapman, the latter the creator of Bob the Builder, as he saw the TV show as a way of introducing motorsport to the next generation.  He is one of the few drivers of his era to create a brand from his name for licensing purposes, which was launched when his website was revamped in 2009 with improved content. Moss is also a supporter of the UK Independence Party.
