Would have liked a cheaper bento option for dinner","output":"The sentiment of the review can be characterized as predominantly positive with mild negative thoughts: Positive Sentiments: 1. The reviewer indicates that the place is good for a night out with girls. This suggests that the atmosphere is upbeat, comfortable, and perhaps even stylish or sophisticated. The reference to it becoming a club on a Saturday night means that it likely has lively music, ambiance, and can accommodate larger groups. 2. There is a mention of the fact that there is no cover charge on a Saturday night, which again indicates a positive sentiment since this can be a cost-saving feature. 3. The reviewer does appreciate the ginger cocktail, signifying satisfaction with some aspect of the beverage options. It appears as though there may be a range in selections and are capable of pleasing varying tastes. 4. The Yellowtail roll and Geisha roll are also appreciated, which points towards approval towards at least some of the food offerings. 5. Furthermore, the use of words such as 'good' and 'like' communicate positive emotions towards the establishment. Negative Sentiments: 1. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the lychee martini, which implies that not all the beverages are to their taste. This could reflect a lacking in some aspects of their drink menu or in the mixology skills. 2. The review contains a desire for a cheaper dinner option, specifically referring to bento. This implies that the reviewer found the menu a bit pricy, or not offering enough value for money, an aspect which they would have preferred to be different. Summing up, the review has both positive and negative sentiments, but they lean more towards the positive side. The reviewer enjoyed the experience on the whole, and while there are areas for improvement (drink quality and price), these problems did not completely overshadow the pleasant aspects of the experience. This would be considered a fairly balanced review with a slight inclination towards positivity."},{"instruction":"Tetrao urogallus - Free English online dictionary based on WordNet 3.0 Please remove spaces between words.","output":"Tetraourogallus, also known as the Western Capercaillie, is a large, distinctive species of grouse found primarily in the coniferous forests of Europe and Asia. They belong to the family Phasianidae and the genus Tetrao. The largest member of the grouse family, the Western Capercaillie, is a charismatic and iconic species that has been the subject of folklore, art, and literature throughout history. Physical Characteristics: Adult male Western Capercaillies are large, with body lengths ranging from 80-115 cm (31-45 inches) and a wingspan of about 90-125 cm (35-49 inches). They typically weigh between 4-6.7 kg (8.8-14.8 lbs). The males are characterized by their striking appearance, which includes iridescent, black-blue plumage, a vivid red eyebrow comb, a bright white wing patch, and a long, curved tail. Female Western Capercaillies are smaller than males, measuring 55-70 cm (21-28 inches) in body length and weighing between 1.8-2.8 kg (4-6.2 lbs). Their plumage is generally reddish-brown, providing effective camouflage when nesting. Both sexes have brown eyes, strong beaks, and large, feathered legs that aid in thermoregulation. Habitat: The Western Capercaillie inhabits mainly mixed and coniferous forests, with preferences ranging from boreal to mountainous regions. Their ideal habitat consists of a mosaic of old, dense forest patches for cover and food resources, scattered with younger tree stands and openings for mating displays. They can be found across Eurasia, spanning countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland, Scotland, Russia, and Central Europe. Behavior: Western Capercaillies are renowned for their elaborate mating rituals, called \\"lekking.\\" In early spring, males gather at traditional lek sites (clearings in the forest) to perform their courtship displays, which involve erecting their fanned tail feathers, raising the red combs over their eyes, and making a series of deep, guttural sounds, followed by wing flapping. This stunning display attracts females to the lek who then choose a male to mate with based on their performance. Diet: The diet of the Western Capercaillie varies seasonally. During spring and summer, they primarily consume a wide variety of leaves, shoots, flowers, and seeds from trees such as pine, spruce, and bilberry. As winter sets in, their diet shifts to focus on conifer needles and buds, often from Scotland's native Caledonian pine. Although largely herbivorous, they occasionally feed on insects and small invertebrates, especially during their breeding season when these protein sources are crucial for growing chicks. Conservation: The Western Capercaillie is listed as \\"Least Concern\\" on the IUCN Red List. However, in some parts of its range, the species is considered threatened or endangered due to a combination of factors including habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation caused by logging, agricultural conversion, and infrastructure development. Climate change and increased disturbance by humans (e.g., outdoor recreation) also pose threats to the species. Conservation efforts are focused on habitat preservation, restoration, and promoting responsible land management practices to safeguard this iconic species' future. In summary, the Tetraourogallus, or Western Capercaillie, is a large, distinctive grouse species inhabiting the coniferous forests of Eurasia. They possess unique physical characteristics, intriguing lekking behavior, and a seasonal diet, making them an interesting and noteworthy component of the ecosystems they inhabit. Despite facing threats to their survival, ongoing conservation efforts aim to protect and preserve their distinctive habitats and natural history."},{"instruction":"Article: My younger sister Sandy was born on May 30 in Hum t County California.

Hypothesis: The two people are in a field. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that the two people are in a field. The information provided states that a woman talking on a cellphone and a man with a mustache emerge up the stairs from an underground subway. This scenario suggests that the two individuals are likely in an urban setting or a city with a subway or metro system. It is important to analyze the given premise thoroughly. The presence of an underground subway indicates a developed transportation infrastructure, which is typically associated with urban or metropolitan areas. Additionally, the woman speaking on a cellphone could also suggest a busier and more connected environment since cellphones are primarily used for communication in urban settings. Having considered the provided information, it would not be logical to assume that the two people are in a field. Fields are generally open landscapes in rural or agricultural environments and are not usually associated with subways or public transportation systems. While it's not impossible for a field to be near an urban location with a subway system, there is not enough evidence in the premise to make that connection, and it would be a leap to conclude that they are in a field based solely on the given premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis that the two people are in a field cannot be derived from the premise provided. The presence of an underground subway suggests an urban setting, while fields are typically found in rural areas far away from such transportation infrastructure. A more plausible hypothesis could be that the two people are in a city or metropolitan area, as these locations are more likely to have subway systems and a higher prevalence of cellphone usage."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you're given statements in native Kannada language.

Ira Lowenstein (David Strathairn) is put in charge, and Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz) is sent out to recruit players. Capadino attends an industrial-league softball game in rural Oregon and likes what he sees in Dottie, the catcher for a local dairy's team. Dottie turns down Capadino's offer, happy with her simple farm life while waiting for her husband Bob (Bill Pullman) to come back from the war. Her sister (and teammate) Kit (Lori Petty), however, is desperate to get away and make something of herself. Capadino is not impressed by Kit's hitting performance, but agrees to take her along if she can change Dottie's mind. Dottie agrees, but only for her sister's sake.

Possible A: being there, movement, having to travel, get excited, walk Why is \\"having to travel\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Having to travel\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it encompasses the various aspects and experiences associated with the process of moving from one place to another. When someone is going somewhere, there are various factors that contribute to the validity of this answer, making it a sensical option within the context of daily human life. 1. Necessity: \\"Having to travel\\" indicates that there is a need or obligation for the individual to go somewhere. This could be due to work, personal reasons, or emergencies. The necessity of travel is an aspect of human life that most individuals experience at some point in time. 2. Planning and preparation: When a person is going somewhere, they often have to plan their route, mode of transport, and other logistics. This could include purchasing tickets, booking accommodations, or even packing bags. The need to make such arrangements can be viewed as \\"having to travel\\" since it is a vital part of the process. 3. Time and effort: Traveling requires a certain amount of time and effort for the individual. They may need to spend a significant amount of time in transit, either driving, taking public transportation, or flying. The more distant the destination, the more time-consuming and effortful the travel becomes. This fact contributes to the understanding that \\"having to travel\\" relates to the energy and commitment involved in the journey. 4. Experiences during the journey: Going somewhere often involves a series of experiences that occur during the trip. This could include meeting new people, navigating unfamiliar environments, or trying local cuisine. The phrase \\"having to travel\\" also encompasses these experiences, as they are a quintessential part of the journey. 5. Personal adaptation: When someone is traveling, personal adaptation may be necessary to accommodate different cultural norms, languages, and time zones. This adaptation adds an additional layer to the concept of \\"having to travel,\\" as it encompasses the cognitive and psychological demands that come with adjusting to new situations. 6. Emotional aspects: Traveling can evoke a range of emotions in individuals. Excitement, anxiety, and homesickness are a few examples of emotions one might experience while going somewhere.

(b). removing the leaves from the stem, place them on a cutting board flat, and using a chef's knife, cut them into the cutting board over and over again, scooping leaves back into a pile repeatedly to cut the pieces smaller each time....I think the answer is","output":"(b). removing the leaves from the stem, place them on a cutting board flat, and using a chef's knife, cut them into the cutting board over and over again, scooping leaves back into a pile repeatedly to cut the pieces smaller each time. The reason why option (b) is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of chopping rosemary into a powder is that it primarily focuses on working with the leaves, where the flavor and aroma are concentrated, rather than the whole branch, which includes the woody, less flavored stems. By taking the time to remove the leaves from the stems first, you are ensuring that only the desired parts of the herb are being processed, which will result in a more uniform and higher quality powder. Furthermore, the approach of method (b) allows for better control of the cutting process and reduces the risk of injury due to the smaller, more manageable pieces. With the leaves approximately the same size, it is easier to achieve a finer consistency, which is necessary for creating a powder. To execute method (b) effectively, follow these steps: 1. Remove the leaves from the rosemary stems: Hold the tip of the stem with one hand and slide your fingers down the stem with the other hand, pulling the leaves off as you go. Discard the stems or reserve them for another use, such as adding flavor to soups or stocks. 2. Spread the leaves out on a cutting board: Ensure that the leaves are in a single layer to make the chopping process more efficient. 3. Chop the leaves with a chef's knife: Using a rocking motion, cut the leaves into the cutting board. Aim for a fine, consistent size across all the leaves. Be patient and take your time. You can also experiment with using a mezzaluna (a curved knife with a handle on each end) to further improve speed and efficiency. 4. Scoop and regroup the leaves: Every so often, gather the chopped leaves back into a pile on your cutting board. This helps to ensure that all the leaves are being chopped evenly and reaching the desired consistency. 5. Continue chopping until a powder is achieved: Keep chopping and regrouping the leaves until you reach the fine, powdery consistency that you're aiming for. 6. Store or use the rosemary powder: Transfer the rosemary powder to an airtight container for storage, or use it immediately in your recipe. By following these steps, you will effectively and efficiently turn rosemary leaves into a fine powder, making it easier to incorporate the herb into your dishes and enhancing the flavor profile of your recipes."},{"instruction":"Options are: (a).

Frozen octopus can be thawed by sitting it in the refrigerator for roughly 24 hours. Frozen octopus actually has an advantage over fresh octopus because the freezing process helps tenderize the meat. Answer:","output":"(b). If you are working with fresh octopus, tenderize it first by beating it with a meat tenderizer. Before cooking frozen octopus, however, it must be completely defrosted. After thawing the octopus, whether it's fresh or frozen, it's essential to prepare it properly to ensure a tender and flavorful dish. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to cook octopus: 1. Clean the octopus: Rinse the octopus under cold water to remove any debris or slime. If it's not pre-cleaned, you'll need to remove the beak and eyes, which are located at the center of the octopus, and discard the ink sac, if present. 2. Tenderize the octopus: If you're working with fresh octopus, use a meat tenderizer or a mallet to gently pound the tentacles to break down the muscle fibers. This step is not necessary for frozen octopus, as the freezing process has already aided in tenderizing the meat. 3. Boil the octopus: Place a large pot of salted water on the stove and bring it to a rolling boil. Add the octopus to the pot, making sure it's fully submerged. Boil it for about 20-30 minutes, depending on the size of the octopus. The octopus should be tender but not mushy when it's done. You can check its tenderness by inserting a fork into one of the tentacles; it should slide in easily. 4. Cool and cut the octopus: Once it's cooked, remove the octopus from the boiling water and let it cool slightly before cutting it into bite-sized pieces. You can also remove the skin if you prefer, but this is optional. 5. Cook the octopus further (optional): While boiling the octopus makes it tender, you can add more flavor and texture by grilling, sautéing, or roasting it afterward. Marinate the cut pieces in olive oil, garlic, and herbs for at least 30 minutes, then cook them using your preferred method until they're slightly charred and crispy on the outside. 6. Serve the octopus: You can serve the cooked octopus on its own as a main dish or incorporate it into other recipes such as salads, pasta dishes, or tapas. Adding fresh herbs, lemon juice, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil can enhance the flavor even further. By following these steps, you'll be able to cook octopus that is tender, flavorful, and perfect for any dish you choose to create.

As a result, when mentioning the \\"road to perdition,\\" one might initially believe that the speaker is referring to an undesirable path that leads to a lousy outcome. On the other hand, the sentence takes an unexpected turn when it ties this dark and pessimistic road to a \\"satisfying destination.\\" The positive connotation of the word \\"satisfying\\" contradicts the feelings of despair associated with perdition. This creates a sense of intrigue, as readers are left pondering the idea that a seemingly doomed journey can ultimately lead to a favorable destination. Given this juxtaposition of opposing sentiments, the overall perception of the sentence's sentiment can be seen as a complex fusion of despair and hope, darkness and light. It veers away from a simplistic interpretation of emotions, and instead portrays a sense of balance and harmony that is atypical of conventional portrayals of emotions. Additionally, the unexpected connection between perdition and satisfaction may also prompt thoughts about personal growth, resilience, and overcoming adversity. It is possible that one might view the described journey as a metaphor for life's challenges, with the optimistic message that even the most difficult paths can lead to a positive outcome if navigated with the right mindset and determination. In this light, the sentiment can be viewed as both provocative and thought-provoking, urging for introspection and contemplation about adversity, change, and the potential for redemption in one's life."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Due to economic sanctions and trade embargoes, Cuban citizens primarily use cars designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These cars contain engines that were designed before the introduction of the catalytic converter. Meanwhile trade relations between nearby Panama and Japan have enabled the citizens of Panama to drive cars with the most up to date catalytic converter technology possible. and a hint : Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. Please answer this question : Which country's cars, Cuba's or Panama's, will emit more nitrogen oxides? Answer:","output":"Cuba's cars will emit more nitrogen oxides compared to Panama's cars. This is because Cuban cars primarily use engines designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s, which were developed before the introduction of the catalytic converter. Catalytic converters play a crucial role in reducing emissions of harmful materials, including nitrogen oxides, from gasoline-powered vehicles. They help convert nitrogen oxides into less harmful substances like nitrogen gas and water. On the other hand, Panama has access to cars with the most up-to-date catalytic converter technology due to their trade relations with Japan. Modern catalytic converters are more efficient at reducing harmful emissions, including nitrogen oxides. Thus, vehicles in Panama will have lower emissions of nitrogen oxides compared to those in Cuba."},{"instruction":"Paragraph: Elaan is a declaration of war against the reign of terror unleashed by the ganglords .

In 1706 he traveled to Italy where he remained for three years, developing his compositional skills. He first settled in Florence where he was introduced to Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti. His first opera composed in Italy, though still reflecting the influence of Hamburg and Mattheson, was Rodrigo (1707, original title Vincer se stesso ê la maggior vittoria), was presented there. It was not particularly successful, but was part of Handel's process of learning to compose opera in the Italian style and to set Italian words to music.Handel then spent time in Rome, where the performance of opera was forbidden by Papal decree, and in Naples. He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of secco recitative and aria da capo. Works from this period include Dixit Dominus and the dramatic cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, written in Naples. While in Rome, probably through Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel had become acquainted with Cardinal Grimani, a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time, and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts. He was evidently impressed by Handel and asked him to set his new libretto, Agrippina. Grimani intended to present this opera at his family-owned theatre in Venice, the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo, as part of the 1709–10 Carnevale season. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that traveled to Italy in 1706?, what is it ?

Cameron James, a new student at Padua High School in the Seattle area, becomes instantly smitten with popular sophomore Bianca Stratford. Geeky Michael Eckman warns him that Bianca is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective father does not allow Bianca or her older sister, the shrewish Kat, to date. Kat, a senior, is accepted to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, but her father, Walter, wants her to stay close to home. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter, an obstetrician worrisome of teenage pregnancy, will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this unlikely.When Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and, as a pretense for allowing her to date Joey, suggests that Cameron find someone willing to date Kat. Cameron selects \\"bad boy\\" Patrick Verona, but Patrick scares him off. Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take out Kat, under the pretense that this will allow Joey to date Bianca. Patrick agrees to the deal, but Kat rebuffs his first few advances. Michael and Cameron help him by prying Bianca for information on Kat's likes and dislikes. Armed with this knowledge, Patrick begins to win Kat's interest. She goes to a party with him, which enables Bianca to go as well, much to Walter's dismay.At the party, Kat becomes upset when she sees Bianca with Joey, and responds by getting drunk. Patrick attends to her, and Kat starts to open up, expressing her interest in starting a band. However, when she tries to kiss him, Patrick pulls away and Kat leaves, infuriated. Meanwhile, Bianca ignores Cameron in favor of Joey, leaving Cameron dejected. Bianca soon realizes, however, that Joey is shallow and self-absorbed, and asks Cameron for a ride home. Cameron admits his feelings for her and his frustration with how she has treated him. Bianca responds by kissing him.Joey offers to pay Patrick to take Kat to the prom so he can take Bianca.

They go on a date which turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious and angry when Patrick insists that she go with him to the prom, an event she is adamantly against. Bianca is irritated that Cameron hasn't asked her to the prom, and so accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter won't allow it unless Kat goes too. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were freshmen and, succumbing to peer pressure, had sex with him. Afterward she regretted it and Joey dumped her, so she vowed to never again do anything just because everyone else was doing it. Bianca insists that she can make her own choices, so Kat agrees to go to the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey.All is going well at the prom until Bianca learns that Joey planned to have sex with her that night.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"If a weak filter is used, it may potentially result in a less effective filtration process. This is because the small pores within the filter may not be as efficient in catching pollutants as they should be, thus allowing more chemicals and impurities to pass through into the filtered water. In the given process, the filter catches chlorine, heavy metals, and other chemicals, while allowing water and mineral ions like fluoride to pass through. When a weaker filter is used, its compromised ability to capture these contaminants could lead to a higher concentration of chemicals in the filtered water. Therefore, the first effect, which is the filter catching more chemicals, will be negatively impacted by the weak filter. As a result, there will be less effectiveness in catching these unwanted substances. The supposed perturbation, which refers to the weak filter being used, influences the second effect mentioned – the filter allowing water and mineral ions like fluoride to pass through. Due to the weak filter's inability to efficiently catch contaminants, it is not only possible that more chemicals will pass through, but also that some of the desired mineral ions (such as fluoride) may be caught in the filtration process as well. This unintended interaction could lead to a lower concentration of beneficial mineral ions in the filtered water.

Here's how to do it step by step: 1. Begin with the equation: 2a + 15 = 7a 2. Our goal is to get all terms containing the variable a on one side and all constants on the other side. So, we need to subtract 2a from both sides of the equal sign. This is done so that the equation remains balanced. Subtract 2a from both sides: 2a - 2a + 15 = 7a - 2a 3. Now simplify both sides of the equation: 15 = 5a 4. Next, we need to isolate the variable a completely. To do this, we should divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of a, which is 5, in this case. Divide both sides by 5: 15/5 = 5a/5 5.

Kitchen: While the kitchen provides visibility, it can be a busy and functional space where the saucer may not be highlighted or protected. 2. Tea room: A tea room can be an appropriate place as it is related to the use of saucers. However, not everyone has a tea room in their home. 3. China cabinet: A china cabinet is designed to display and protect valuable or decorative items like a saucer. It is typically made of glass, allowing clear visibility. 4. Kitchen cabinet: A kitchen cabinet is usually used for storing items, not for displaying. The saucer may not be easily visible in this space. 5. Cup: Placing the saucer in a cup limits its visibility and defeats the purpose of wanting to look at it. After evaluating the options, I conclude that a china cabinet is the most suitable place to keep a saucer you don't use but want to look at. It offers visibility and protection while also showcasing the saucer."},{"instruction":"I heard that Jordan ate healthy and watched her diet. And I was wondering Why did Jordan do this?

Answer:","output":"The question seems to refer to a species endemic to Victoria, Australia, specifically within a set of low mountain ranges known as Mount Dandenong and its variants. The answer will require a combination of several pieces of information to provide a comprehensive response. First, let's identify the mountain range mention in the question. Mount Dandenong is located in Victoria, Australia, and it is a part of the Dandenong Ranges. The Dandenong Ranges are a series of low mountain ranges, which rise up to 633 meters at Mount Dandenong. These ranges are known for their lush and diverse vegetation, including ferns, eucalyptus, and numerous other plant species that are native to the area. Given the context provided, the desired information pertains to a species endemic to this region, as described in a scientific journal. It's essential to identify the specific species and the journal in which it was described. One such example of an endemic species in the Dandenong Ranges is the Lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae). The Lyrebird is famous for its astonishing ability to mimic various sounds, including chainsaws, car alarms, and other birdsongs. It is one of the few remaining ancient bird species from the family Menuridae, and it is endemic to southeastern Australia. The scientific description of the Lyrebird was first published in the journal \\"Transactions of the Linnean Society of London\\" by George Shaw, an English zoologist, and botanist, in 1800. The paper titled \\"Menura superba or Superb Menura: a Bird of the genus Menura of Authors; a native of New-Holland\\" depicted the Lyrebird's unique characteristics and its habitat. Please note that while this species can be found in the Dandenong Ranges, it is not exclusively endemic to that specific area, as it is also found in other parts of southeastern Australia. Now, given the mention of a variant of a species, it is possible that a particular subspecies or ecotype of an endemic species has adapted to Mount Dandenong's specific conditions. However, without a clearer reference to the journal article or the exact species in question, it's challenging to find precise information. There are numerous scientific journals, such as the \\"Victorian Naturalist\\" and \\"Australian Journal of Zoology,\\" which have published articles focusing on the ecology, distribution, and conservation of various species in Australia, including those in the Dandenong Ranges. To summarize, Mount Dandenong is part of the low-mountain range called the Dandenong Ranges in Victoria, Australia. Numerous species have been studied and described in various journals, with the Lyrebird being a noteworthy example. The Lyrebird was initially described by George Shaw in \\"Transactions of the Linnean Society of London.\\" It is essential to have more specificity in the question to identify the exact species or variant and the journal in which it was described accurately."},{"instruction":"By. Sam Webb. PUBLISHED:. 10:30 EST, 19 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 02:41 EST, 20 February 2013. A border guard in Belarus has been jailed for two years for failing to defend the ex-soviet nation from an attack by parachuting teddy bears. Belarus Supreme Court said Monday that the guard has been convicted of failure to report the intrusion of a light plane that dropped hundreds of teddy bears decked out in parachutes and slogans supporting human rights over the tightly-controlled country of 10 million. The court wouldn't give his name or rank. A border guard in Belarus has been jailed for not reporting an airdrop of teddy bears over a residential area in Minsk. The teddies, with pro democracy signs attached, were dropped by Swedish activists. Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko, dubbed 'Europe's last dictator' in the West, was furious over the July 4 incident. Two Swedish advertising agency employees flew into Belarus' heavily guarded airspace in a show of support for human rights activists in Belarus, a nation where people were arrested for clapping, including a one-armed man, in 2011. Lukashenko fired two generals, the head of the country's air force and the boss of border security. President Alexander Lukashenko is the controversial leader of Belarus. He has been in power since 1994 and wields tremendous political power. 'How do you explain the provocation with the airplane that not only crossed our borders, but entered the territory of Belarus unpunished?', he is reported to have thundered at officials. He added that any future air space violations, even those by freedom-loving cuddly toys, should be brought down with anti-air missiles. Alexander Lukashenko, a former collective farm manager, has been in power since 1994. Two years after taking control he abandoned the country's parliament and hand-picked another just as it was about to impeach him. Belarus is under a raft of sanctions by the European Union over the plight of political prisoners in the country. Last year Lukashenko provoked diplomatic rebuke from Germany when he insulted the openly gay German Foreign Minister, Guido Westerwelle, by stating that it was 'better to be a dictator than gay'. The remark was made at a summit that called for new measures to pressure Belarus over human rights abuses where Westerwelle had referred to Lukashenko as 'Europe's last dictator'. Belarus then expelled Sweden's ambassador, Stefan Erikkson, saying: 'Mr Eriksson has worked in Minsk for seven years. 'In this time his activity has been directed not at strengthening Belarussian-Swedish relations but at destroying them.' Stockholm said the situation was 'ridiculous'. Sweden has been actively pushing for democracy in Belarus. Lukashenko's re-election in December 2010, marred by fraud, led Stockholm to focus its Belarus strategy on democracy, human rights and equality. Sweden's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt reiterated Sweden's commitment to Belarusian human rights a month after the teddy bear drop. He wrote on Twitter: 'We remain strongly committed to the freedom of Belarus and all its citizens. 'They deserve the freedoms and the rights of the rest of Europe.' Belarus is a former Soviet republic which became independent with the collapse of the USSR. It still uses the rouble, its secret police is known as the KGB and the state has a powerful influence over ordinary people's lives. Human rights campaigners in the country are persecuted and often face harrassment, beatings and prison, while the media is strictly-controlled. Oppression: Demonstrators hold placards in support of democracy outside the Belarussian embassy in London in 2006. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article written by Sam Webb and published on February 19, 2013, discusses a peculiar event which unfolded in Belarus. A border guard was sentenced to two years in prison for failure to defend against a unique 'attack' that involved teddy bears dropped from a light aircraft. These teddy bears, placed in parachutes and adorned with endorsements for human rights, descended over the tightly regulated country of 10 million residents in an airdrop orchestrated by Swedish activists. Belarus' president, Alexander Lukashenko, was infuriated by the event, which unfolded on July 4, leading to the firing of the chief of the country's air force and the head of border security. The teddy bear drop, executed by employees of a Swedish advertising agency, was a bold bid to show solidarity with human rights activists in Belarus, where the mere act of clapping had, in past years, led to arrests. Lukashenko, often referred to as 'Europe's last dictator' by the Western countries, has maintained a firm hold on power since 1994, even terminating the country's parliament two years into his regime as it was on the brink of impeaching him. His administration is under multiple sanctions imposed by the European Union due to the dismal conditions of political prisoners in Belarus. The article also mentions a diplomatic incident the previous year involving offensive comments Lukashenko made against the openly-gay German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. Lukashenko's remark led to a backlash, which generated further pressure on his government over human rights issues. Criticisms of Lukashenko's regime extend beyond tactics associated with traditional political oppression - in the aftermath of the teddy bear incident, the government expelled Sweden's ambassador, Stefan Eriksson, accusing him of working towards undermining Belarusian-Swedish relations rather than fortifying them. Despite these impediments, Sweden has continually advocated for democracy in Belarus, specifically after Lukashenko's controversial re-election in December 2010. Following the teddy bear drop, Sweden's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt confirmed their commitment towards Belarusian human rights on Twitter. Belarus, a former Soviet republic that gained independence following the dissolution of the USSR, still utilizes the rouble as currency and maintains a secret police force named the KGB. The government substantially influences the lives of ordinary citizens while human rights campaigners face persecution, including harassment, beatings, and imprisonments. The media in the country is also strictly controlled."},{"instruction":"Q:Title: Sorry All Review: I know I'll take heat for this, but this albumn is not the Son Volt that many of us fans fell in love with.

Corey's military pal, Steve Connolly, arrives in early November to discuss plans for the ranch in Scottsdale, Arizona, they plan to purchase and operate together once Corey is out of the hospital. The two men pool their G.I. benefits (totaling 40,000) to do so. Corey's final surgery is in mid-December, but Connolly does not appear at the hospital afterward to see his friend. By Christmas, Corey is still in recovery but Connolly still remains absent.

With a grunt of effort, Angela hoisted the enormous stone up, knees shaking with the strain. This was the culmination of years of training - every push-up, sprint, and deadlift had been leading up to this moment. Step 1: Understand the context. The context here indicates a competition between two individuals, Angela and Christine, most likely related to strength or fitness given the mention of the atlas stone. Step 2: Decipher the required tone and writing style. The given text has a narrative style and sets a tone of intensity and competition. Step 3: Continue the story within the defined tone and context. Here a turn of events with ups and downs is required to render the storyline engaging. So, I write, Christine stood off to one side of the arena, her face flushed and sweat gleaming on her forehead. She had lifted the atlas stone earlier, surprisingly with much ease, setting a formidable challenge for Angela. But Angela’s success had changed the course of the competition. The audience gasped, even as Angela's coach's face broke into a wide grin. Few had believed she could do it, given her size compared to Christine's. Step 4: Illustrate Angela's determination. This provides a justification for Angela’s triumph despite the odds, and also helps clearly define her character. Despite the odds, Angela had always been a fighter. For Angela, the physical mass of the stone was not the enemy, defeat was. She was not just battling Christine, she was battling herself - her limitations, her doubts, her fears. The stone was merely a symbol. Step 5: Finalize the text with a strong reflection. This provides a meaningful wrap-up to the narration. And thus, when Angela's triumph came, it carried a weight far heavier than the atlas stone. It was a victory not just over Christine, but over self-doubt and limitations. It was a victory for every small person who had been told they couldn't. For Angela, it wasn’t about proving who was stronger. It was about proving that strength was not a measure of physique, but a battle of willpower and determination."},{"instruction":"Lizzy: A library cabinet houses five ancient scrolls. The first scroll is 4080 years old. If each scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll’s age, how old is the fifth scroll?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"To find the age of the fifth scroll, we need to first identify the age difference between each consecutive pair of scrolls. Given that each scroll is older than the previous one by half as many years as the previous scroll's age, we can set up a series of equations to solve for the age of the fifth scroll. Let A1 represent the age of the first scroll, A2 the age of the second scroll, A3 the age of the third scroll, A4 the age of the fourth scroll, and A5 the age of the fifth scroll. A1 = 4080 years (given) For the second scroll (A2), its age difference with A1 is half the age of the first scroll (A1), so the age difference is (1/2 * A1). Therefore: A2 = A1 + (1/2 * A1) = 4080 + (1/2 * 4080) = 4080 + 2040 = 6120 years For the third scroll (A3), the age difference with A2 is half the age difference between A1 and A2 (which is 2,040 years). So, the age difference is (1/2 * 2040). Therefore: A3 = A2 + (1/2 * 2040) = 6120 + 1020 = 7140 years For the fourth scroll (A4), the age difference with A3 is half the age difference between A2 and A3 (which is 1,020 years). So, the age difference is (1/2 * 1020). Therefore: A4 = A3 + (1/2 * 1020) = 7140 + 510 = 7650 years Finally, for the fifth scroll (A5), the age difference with A4 is half the age difference between A3 and A4 (which is 510 years). So, the age difference is (1/2 * 510). Therefore: A5 = A4 + (1/2 * 510) = 7650 + 255 = 7905 years So, the age of the fifth scroll is 7,905 years."},{"instruction":"Question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Music comes in many forms; most countries have a style of their own. The US is well known for jazz , which has gained world-wide popularity. In contrast to classical music, which follows formal European traditions, jazz is natural and free-form. It is full of energy, expressing the moods, interests, and feelings of the people. It has a modern sound that makes people very excited. In the 1920s jazz sounded like America. And So it does today. The origins of this music are as interesting as the music itself. Jazz was produced by American blacks, who were brought to the Southern States as slaves. They were sold to plantation owners and forced to work long hours in the cotton and tobacco fields. This work was hard and life was short. When a Negro died, his friends and relatives formed a group to carry the body to the cemetery. A band often went with them. On the way to the cemetery the band played slow and sad music. But on the way home the mood changed. _ Everybody was happy. Death had removed one of their members, but the living were glad to be alive. The band played happy music, which made everyone want to dance. It was an early form of jazz. Music has always been important in their lives. Coming mainly from West Africa, the black men who were brought to America already possessed a rich musical tradition. This music centered on religious ceremonies in which dancing, singing, clapping and stamping to the beat of a drum were important forms of musical expression. As these people settled in to their fields, they made up work songs. Singing made the hard work go faster. Another musical form that helped to develop jazz was the blues. Blues songs always describe something sad -- an unhappy love affair, a money problem, bad luck. To this day, the expression \\"feeling blue\\" means being sad.

On Tuesday it was a night of pomp and glamor at the White House as President Donald Trump and Mrs. Trump welcomed French President Macron and his wife for a state dinner.

Answer choices: - The flowers are pollinated - fertilization occurs - fertilization - Help plants grow - The flowers fall off - They get too much water - it keeps an organism warm - They grow underground Answer:","output":"The process of cucumber formation from flowers involves a series of steps. Firstly, the flowers are pollinated by insects like bees who transfer pollen from the male flowers to the female flowers. This process is essential for fertilization to occur, as it helps in the fusion of male and female gametes. After successful pollination and fertilization, the flower's ovary begins to enlarge and develop into a fruit, which in this case is the cucumber. The fertilization process ensures that a viable seed can be formed inside the fruit, enabling reproduction and the future growth of new cucumber plants. During the cucumber's growth stage, the petals of the flower fall off, as their purpose of attracting pollinators has been fulfilled. The developing cucumber grows in size and continues to mature, drawing water and nutrients from the plant. Contrary to the notion of underground growth, cucumbers grow above the ground on vines or trellises, depending on how they are supported during cultivation. In summary, cucumbers come from flowers through the process of pollination, followed by fertilization, resulting in the growth and development of the cucumber from the fertilized ovary while the flower petals fall off."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Why do we feel thirsty after eating biryani? Why do we feel thirsty after eating?","output":"While the two questions may seem similar on the surface, they are not exactly the same. The first question is specifically about feeling thirsty after eating biryani, a particular dish, while the second question addresses the general feeling of thirst after eating any type of food. To understand the differences, we should examine the reasons for feeling thirsty following both scenarios in more detail. 1. Why do we feel thirsty after eating biryani? Biryani is a popular South Asian dish that involves cooking rice with meat, vegetables, and a variety of spices. Each ingredient contributes to the sensation of thirst that often follows the consumption of this dish. Some factors include: a. Salt content: Biryani, like many flavorful dishes, usually contains a significant amount of salt. Consuming foods high in salt can cause dehydration and an increased sensation of thirst as the body tries to balance the sodium levels. b. Spices: Biryani is also characterized by the use of spicy ingredients, such as chili powder, cumin, and ginger. These spices can stimulate the body's thirst mechanism as a response to the hot and spicy sensations in the mouth. Additionally, since they can sometimes irritate the digestive system, the body may crave more water to help dilute and process these compounds. c. High-protein content: Biryani typically contains meat, which can lead to a higher protein content in the dish. Eating more protein can increase the body's requirement for water as the kidneys need more fluids to excrete the resulting nitrogenous waste. 2. Why do we feel thirsty after eating? The feeling of thirst after eating, regardless of the type of food consumed, can result from various reasons. Some are similar to the factors discussed above, but several other causes come into play depending on the meal consumed. These include: a. Dehydration: If you were dehydrated before eating, consuming food might divert some water from the stomach to aid in digestion. As a result, the sensation of thirst may amplify after a meal. b. Dry or salty foods: Consuming foods that are dry, salty, or both can contribute to the feeling of thirst after eating, as they require additional fluid intake to moisten the mouth and aid in digestion. c. Fluid regulation: When food enters the stomach, the body secretes various digestive juices, and the stomach may need more water to dilute and break down the components of the meal. As a result, the body might signal additional water intake by inducing the sensation of thirst. d. Alcohol or caffeine: Consuming alcoholic or caffeinated beverages alongside a meal can further contribute to feelings of thirst, as both alcohol and caffeine can have a diuretic effect and promote fluid loss. To summarize, while the two questions may seem similar, the first question specifically addresses the feeling of thirst that arises after consuming biryani, which can result from its salt content, spicy ingredients, and high-protein content. On the other hand, the second question pertains to the feeling of thirst after eating any type of food, which can be caused by dehydration, dry or salty foods, fluid regulation, or the consumption of alcohol and caffeine alongside a meal."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on yvonne romain 's: - birth name - spouse - birth date - name - birth place Bio: yvonne romain -lrb- born yvonne warren , 17 february 1938 -rrb- is a british film and television actress of the late 1950s and 1960s .

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - fast food restaurant - vegetable market - ireland - produce market - dessert spot A:","output":"The most suitable option to answer the question \\"What business uses lots of potatoes?\\" is a fast food restaurant. First and foremost, fast food restaurants, which are part of a global multi-billion dollar industry, rely heavily on potatoes as a staple ingredient in their menus. The popularity of fast food chains can be attributed to their quick service, affordability, and appealing taste that caters to a wide range of consumers. In these establishments, potatoes are usually served in the form of French fries, a universally adored side dish or snack that complements various types of fast food items like burgers, sandwiches, and fried chicken. The reason why potatoes, specifically in the form of French fries, are so widespread in fast food establishments is due to their flavor, texture, and adaptability. The process of deep-frying potatoes creates a crispy exterior with a soft and fluffy interior, making them an irresistible combination that many customers crave. Additionally, French fries can be served with a variety of toppings and condiments, such as cheese, chili, ketchup, mayonnaise, or vinegar, providing an array of options for customers to choose from or customize according to their preferences. Besides being a side dish, potatoes are also used as ingredients in other fast food offerings, such as hash browns served during breakfast hours, potato wedges, and even as a component in some specialty sandwiches. Therefore, the potato's versatility and compatibility with other food items make it a staple in the fast food restaurant business. While other options like vegetable markets, produce markets, and Ireland encompass businesses or places where potatoes are involved in some capacity, these options don't specifically revolve around using large quantities of potatoes in their day-to-day operations. Vegetable markets and produce markets are places where potatoes are sold in their raw and unprocessed form, and their main function is to act as a platform for customers to purchase fresh produce, not necessarily making use of the potatoes themselves. As for Ireland, it is true that potatoes have historically been an important part of the country's agricultural economy. However, Ireland refers to a geographic location and not a specific type of business that consumes large amounts of potatoes. Lastly, a dessert spot is a business that focuses primarily on providing an array of sweet treats and delicacies. Although some desserts may occasionally use potatoes as an ingredient, it's not the main focus of their offerings, so the use of potatoes in dessert spots is far less significant than in a fast food restaurant. In conclusion, a fast food restaurant is the most suitable option to answer the question since these establishments consistently use vast quantities of potatoes to cater to the culinary needs and tastes of their customers."},{"instruction":"Answer the question...how many seasons of pillars of the earth are there??","output":"The Pillars of the Earth is a historical drama television miniseries based on Ken Follett's 1989 novel of the same name. The miniseries initially aired in July 2010 as an eight-episode series on Starz in the United States and on The Movie Network in Canada. The TV adaptation was created by John Pielmeier and directed by Sergio Mimica-Gezzan. As of currently, there is only one season of The Pillars of the Earth, consisting of eight episodes. While many fans have hoped for additional seasons, there have been no announcements or plans for any further installments. However, it is worth noting that Ken Follett has written a sequel to the original novel called \\"World Without End,\\" set 200 years after the events of \\"The Pillars of the Earth.\\" This sequel has also been adapted into a television miniseries, which aired in 2012, but it is considered a separate project rather than a continuation of The Pillars of the Earth series.

Statement Analysis: - Anthropologists and archaeologists in the 1980s suggested that most contemporary groups identified as hunter-gatherers do not have a continuous history of hunting and gathering. - The statement claims that many of these groups have ancestors who were agriculturalists and/or pastoralists who were pushed into marginal areas due to various reasons, including migrations, economic exploitation, and violent conflict. Now, I will investigate if the information in the statement serves as the correct answer to the question. Question: If they're not purely hunter-gatherers, then what do they have a history of being? The statement suggests that many groups usually identified as hunter-gatherers have a history of being agriculturalists and/or pastoralists. This directly addresses the question of what these groups' history might be if they are not purely hunter-gatherers. Therefore, based on the statement provided, the correct answer to the question would be that, if they're not purely hunter-gatherers, they have a history of being agriculturalists and/or pastoralists.

The statement also mentions that one of the players is being pushed by another. It's important to recognize that the act of being pushed in the context of playing Monopoly should be interpreted figuratively, and not literally. In this scenario, being \\"pushed\\" by another player might indicate that the player in question is under some kind of pressure, or being challenged or provoked by another player's actions on the board. For example, they may feel cornered by the other player's property acquisitions or threatened by their overall game strategy. This might also imply some level of competitiveness or rivalry among the participants. Despite the presence of the pushing element, the focus remains on the fact that all three young men are engaged in playing Monopoly together. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that three men are playing Monopoly in this scenario. The fact that one is being pushed by the other simply provides additional context and introduces an aspect of interactivity, competition, or contention among the players. It does not negate or modify the fact that there are three men actively involved in the game."},{"instruction":"Attributes: name = The Eagle, eatType = coffee shop, food = French, priceRange = £20-25, customer rating = 3 out of 5, area = riverside, familyFriendly = no, near = Burger King.

Context: The battle lines are drawn once again. U.S. law enforcement agencies and Silicon Valley are getting ready to face off on the issue of privacy. This latest battle is focused on a 30-year-old law on government access to electronic communications and associated data. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act was a forward-looking statute when enacted in 1986, but technology has dramatically outpaced the ECPA. The U.S. Congress has been looking into ways to revise the law in order to preserve the privacy of internet users while also preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the law and protect the public. The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called privacy \\"the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.\\" The Senate Judiciary Committee this week is considering an amendment to the ECPA that would expand the government's ability to collect data using a National Security Letter, which doesn't require a court order.

The FBI contends that such data is covered implicitly under current statute, which was written years ago and only explicitly covers data normally associated with telephone records. FBI Director James Comey has said the amendment is needed to fix \\"a typo\\" in the ECPA that has hindered the bureau's ability to work in \\"a very, very big and practical way.\\" But a letter sent earlier this week warned Congress that such an amendment is opposed by tech giants and civil liberties organizations. \\"This expansion of the NSL statute has been characterized by some government officials as merely fixing ‘a typo' in the law,” the letter said. \\"In reality, however, it would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users' online...

Jessica has a lot more company over to their house than Erin because Options: 1). Jessica loves to socialize.. 2). Erin loves to socialize..","output":"Jessica has a lot more company over to their house than Erin because Jessica loves to socialize. She finds great joy and fulfillment in surrounding herself with people from various backgrounds and engaging in diverse conversations. Jessica has always been an extrovert, thriving in social settings and continuously seeking opportunities to make new connections and create unforgettable memories with friends. She's often seen hosting delightful gatherings, whether they are intimate dinner parties with close friends, bustling holiday events, or laid-back barbecues in her backyard. Over time, Jessica has built an eclectic and dynamic group of friends, all of whom enjoy her company and share in her love for socialization. On the other hand, Erin prefers quieter, more intimate gatherings with a select few friends, as she values the deep connections and conversations she can have in smaller groups. Although Erin also enjoys socializing, her love for it is not as great as Jessica's; she leans more towards introversion. Erin is the type of person who would choose a cozy night in with a couple of close friends over a loud, crowded party filled with acquaintances and strangers. Erin cherishes her friendships just as much as Jessica, but her approach to fostering and maintaining them is quite different. Erin and Jessica's contrasting preferences when it comes to socializing play a significant role in the frequency and scale of the gatherings held at their respective homes. Jessica, with her eagerness to include as many people as possible and create a lively atmosphere, is inclined to host events and invite numerous guests more often than Erin, who values a more low-key, intimate environment. This difference in their personalities and desires when it comes to socialization is what ultimately leads to Jessica having more company over to their house than Erin."},{"instruction":"Imagine a question and stream-of-consciousness explanation for which this is the answer: no","output":"Question: Is it possible to safely drive a car with your eyes closed? Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When considering the act of driving, one must take into account the importance of visual input in safely navigating the road. A driver relies heavily on their ability to see the road ahead, read road signs, and observe the actions of other vehicles. Without the ability to see, a driver would be flying blind, risking not only their own safety but also the safety of others around them. Furthermore, driving with one's eyes closed would be a clear violation of traffic laws in most places, as it would be considered reckless and dangerous. In addition, during driving, many unexpected situations can arise, such as sudden changes in traffic, obstacles in the road, or changes in weather conditions. A driver with their eyes closed would be unable to react to these occurrences, increasing the likelihood of an accident. Additionally, without visual input, a driver would be unable to maintain a consistent speed or stay within their lane, both critical aspects of safe driving. In summary, the various factors that contribute to the safe operation of a motor vehicle all depend on the ability to see and respond to the road conditions, the actions of other drivers, and environmental factors. Consequently, attempting to drive with one's eyes closed would be dangerous, irresponsible, and illegal. Answer: No"},{"instruction":"A woman begs in front of a mosque in Istanbul.

Captive breeding is a process in which animals are bred in controlled environments within well-defined settings, such as wildlife reserves, zoos or other commercial and non-commercial conservation facilities. Given that their extinction was mainly due to sport hunting, protecting them in environments where hunting is strictly controlled or prohibited can significantly help increase their numbers and gradually reintroduce them into the wild when suitable and safe.

The distance can be expressed in various units, such as miles, kilometers, or even flying time, depending on the context or preference of the person asking the question. To provide a more detailed answer: London, UK, and California, USA, are separated by approximately 5,437 miles (8,751 kilometers) when calculating the distance based on a straight line, also known as the \\"as the crow flies\\" or \\"great-circle distance.\\" However, it is essential to note that this distance does not account for real-world travel conditions, like the shape of the earth, actual travel routes, and differing altitudes. When considering air travel, the flight distance between the two locations varies depending on the specific cities and airports involved. For example, a non-stop flight from London Heathrow Airport (LHR) to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) covers a distance of about 5,468 miles (8,803 kilometers). The flying time for this route is usually around 11 hours, though it is subject to factors like weather, air traffic, and individual airline routes. When considering ground travel, there is no direct road connection between London and California, as they are located on different continents. As a result, the trip would require a combination of land and sea transport, such as driving through Europe and Asia, taking ferries where necessary, and continuing the journey through the United States. This route would involve a significantly longer distance and travel time compared to air travel. In summary, the answer to the distance between London, UK, and California would be a numeric value, as it represents the measurement between the two locations.

Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Who will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm? The answer is:","output":"Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm. There are several factors contributing to this answer: 1. Fertilizer use: Bobby is using more fertilizer on his farm due to his increased production of potatoes, while Kenny's fertilizer usage is currently low since his tomatoes are not in season. When rain carries the excess fertilizer into nearby ponds, it can lead to nutrient pollution, primarily from nitrogen and phosphorus. 2. Eutrophication: Increased nutrient levels in the ponds can lead to eutrophication, a process where the excess nutrients promote the growth of algae and other aquatic plants. As these plants proliferate, they consume more oxygen through respiration and block sunlight from reaching other aquatic life. 3. Algal blooms and oxygen depletion: As algae die and decompose, they are broken down by bacteria, which use up even more oxygen in the process. This can lead to oxygen depletion, creating dead zones where oxygen levels are too low to support most aquatic life. Since Bobby's increased use of fertilizer leads to more nutrient pollution being washed into the nearby ponds, his farm is contributing more to eutrophication, algal blooms, and oxygen depletion, compared to Kenny's farm, where fertilizer usage is lower. Thus, Kenny's farm is causing less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their respective farms."},{"instruction":"Question: Given this review: \\"selim mondal 825045\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Options: (A) 10 sec (B) 8 sec (C) 5 sec (D) 6 sec (E) 11 sec","output":"First, let's break down the problem and determine what we need to find. We are given the length of the train (60 meters), its speed (36 km/h), and we need to find the time it takes for the train to pass a telegraph post. Step 1: Convert the speed from km/h to m/s. Since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 3600 seconds in an hour, we can use the following conversion formula: (speed in m/s) = (speed in km/h) * (1000 meters/1 km) * (1 hour/3600 seconds). So, (speed in m/s) = (36 km/h) * (1000/3600) = 10 m/s. Step 2: Find the time it takes to pass the telegraph post. We can use the formula: distance = speed * time. Rearranging for time, we get: time = distance / speed. In this case, the distance traveled by the train is equal to its length, since it must completely pass the telegraph post. So, the distance is 60 meters. Using the speed we converted to m/s (10 m/s), we can now find the time: time = distance / speed = 60 meters / 10 m/s = 6 seconds. So, the railway train will pass the telegraph post in 6 seconds. The correct answer is (D) 6 sec."},{"instruction":"Question: Who was the second cricketer to score 36 runs off an over in first class cricket? Answer:","output":"The second cricketer to achieve the feat of scoring 36 runs in an over in first-class cricket was Gary Sobers. Born on July 28, 1936, Sir Garfield St Aubrun Sobers, often referred to as Gary Sobers, is a cricketing legend from Barbados who played for the West Indies. This remarkable feat took place on August 31, 1968, during a match between Nottinghamshire and Glamorgan at Swansea in England. Sobers was playing for Nottinghamshire at that time. The bowler from Glamorgan who conceded these 36 runs in a single over was Malcolm Nash. The detail of this memorable over is as follows: The first two balls went for a couple of bouncers that Sobers dismissed in consecutive drives over the long-off boundary fence for two sixes. The third ball was a low full-toss which Sobers again met with a powerful cross-batted swipe that ended up clearing the mid-wicket boundary fence. The fourth delivery was a length ball which Sobers smoked over the long-on boundary to record his fourth consecutive six. The penultimate ball turned out to be a flighted delivery over which Sobers used his feet and dispatched the ball way over the long-off boundary fence. With five sixes in a row, Sobers herself smashed the last ball over the mid-wicket boundary fence to score the maximum in each of six balls of the over. Thus, he became the first cricketer to hit six sixes off one over in first-class cricket. Before Sobers, the first cricketer to score 36 runs in an over was Ted Alletson in 1911. However, unlike Sobers, he did not hit six sixes but managed to score 34 runs (including 2 no-balls) with a combination of boundaries. Sir Garfield Sobers' exceptional feat of scoring 36 runs is etched in cricketing folklore and is considered to be one of the remarkable milestones in the history of the sport. His accomplishment showcases incredible power, precision, and skill. The bat he used to score those 36 runs in a single over is now on display at the Cricket Museum at the MCC. Sobers ended his career in 1974 with a great record in both batting and bowling. He scored 8032 runs in 93 tests with an average of 57.78 and took 235 wickets. His cricketing prowess, versatility, and contribution to the game have led to him being universally acclaimed as cricket's greatest all-rounder."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a passage and a question regarding that passage. You must determine whether or not the question is answerable from the given passage. If a question is answerable, output should be 'True', otherwise 'False'. You must not consider any other information that is not provided in the passage while labelling True or False. Passage: Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \\"indirect\\" discriminatory (or \\"indistinctly applicable\\") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \\"mandatory\\" or \\"overriding\\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \\"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\\" and labelling would protect consumers \\"just as effectively\\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \\"chocolate\\". It had to be \\"chocolate substitute\\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \\"chocolate substitute\\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \\"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\\" that \\"affects the access of that product to the market\\". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. Question: What did the Court of Justice justify about a low content of vegetable fat?","output":"To perform this task, I carefully read and analyzed the given passage. I located the segment of the passage that discusses the Court of Justice's decision on the matter of a low content of vegetable fat.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less coal pollution enters clouds happens, how will it affect MORE acid rain. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if less coal pollution enters the clouds, it will have an effect on the occurrence of acid rain. The main question here is whether this change would lead to more acid rain or not. To understand the potential effects of the perturbation, let us examine the process in depth and explore the possible outcomes. The process of acid rain formation due to coal pollution consists of the following steps: 1. People dig up coal from the ground: Coal, a fossil fuel, is extracted from the earth through mining. 2. People burn coal for heat or electricity: Coal is primarily used for electricity generation and as a heating source. Burning coal releases energy, but also produces a significant amount of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). 3. Pollution from the coal goes into the sky: When coal is burned, SO2 and NOx are released into the atmosphere. These pollutants can travel long distances and combine with water vapor in the air. 4. Coal pollution enters clouds: The SO2 and NOx molecules react with water vapor in the atmosphere, forming sulfuric and nitric acids. These acidic compounds become part of clouds and can be transported over large areas. 5. Clouds rain over an area: When clouds become saturated, they release precipitation in different forms, including rain. If the clouds contain high levels of the acidic compounds mentioned, the rainwater will become acidic. 6. The polluted rain becomes acid rain: Acid rain is rainwater with a pH below 5.6 (the normal pH of rain is about 5.6-6.0). This acidic water can cause a range of problems, from damaging forests and aquatic ecosystems to corroding buildings and infrastructure. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: suppose less coal pollution enters clouds. There are several potential implications of this change: - Direct effect: Reduction in SO2 and NOx emissions: If less coal pollution enters clouds (due to reduced coal combustion or improved pollution control measures), there will be a lower concentration of SO2 and NOx in the atmosphere. This would directly reduce the formation of sulfuric and nitric acids, thus decreasing the levels of acid rain. - Indirect effect: Cleaner clouds could lead to less pollution washout: Acidic particles and gases can be washed out of the atmosphere by precipitation, a process known as \\"scavenging\\" or \\"washout.\\" If there is less pollution (in the form of SO2 and NOx) entering clouds, the overall amount of pollutants removed from the atmosphere by rain might be reduced, which could potentially impact other aspects of air quality and climate. - Indirect effect: Changes to regional atmospheric chemistry: Lowering coal pollution may potentially influence regional atmospheric chemistry, which in turn could affect cloud formation, precipitation patterns, and acid rain distribution. This might result in acid rain being concentrated in certain areas or becoming more widespread, depending on various factors such as regional emissions and meteorological conditions. Based on these observations, the proposed perturbation of less coal pollution entering clouds could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of acid rain formation. In general, it can be expected that by reducing coal pollution, there will be less acid rain overall. However, indirect consequences may lead to changes in the spatial distribution of acid rain, potentially leading to local increases in certain areas. Further research and modeling studies would be required to predict specific regional effects under different pollution reduction scenarios."},{"instruction":"Consider the question.

Article: With just a few minutes left before school was to start, my six-year-old, Dustin, was crying. \\"I don't want to go,\\" he said. Ever since he'd entered first grade, he had hated school. What's going on? If he hates school this much now, how bad will it be later on? Every kid sometimes complains about school. But five to ten percent of kids dislike it so much they don't want to attend. \\"If a child seems worried or anxious about school, pretends illness to stay home, or refuses to talk about things of the school day, you should be concerned,\\" says a school psychologist, Michael Martin. Fortunately, you can usually solve the problem--sometimes very easily. In our case, my husband and I visited Dustin's class and noticed that the teacher, just out of college, called only on kids who sat right under her nose. Dustin, who often sat near the back, was ignored . We simply told him to move up front. He did, and he was happy again. Question: From the case in the passage we can conclude that _ . Options: A: a child hating school needn't be taken seriously B: a small thing may lead a child to dislike going to school C: parents have to get in touch with teachers D: parents should know how teachers teach children The answer is:","output":"B: a small thing may lead a child to dislike going to school Step 1: Analyze the passage to find the problem and solution presented.

Spring-flowering bulbs are most visually appealing when a variety of flowers are planted in an arrangement. Depending on your level of gardening experience, you may want to start out with only 2 or 3 types of spring bulbs. If you’re confident in your gardening skills, select a half dozen bulb varieties. Purchase at least 3 or 4 individual bulbs of each variety. Popular combinations of spring bulbs that can be planted together include: Tulips, daffodils, and snowflakes. Bearded irises, Siberian irises, crocuses, and bluebells. Snowdrops, crocuses, and hyacinth. Note that the bulbs in each combination are roughly the same size and can be planted at the same depth in the same hole. Nearly all plant nurseries stock bulbs year-round. If you visit the nursery in the fall, around September or October in the Northern Hemisphere, their selection of spring-blooming bulbs will be at its largest. Healthy, high quality bulbs will be rounded and firm, and not have any cracks or wrinkles on their surface. If there isn’t a nursery in your area, many large home-supply stores have an onsite gardening center. If you don’t live near a brick and mortar nursery or garden center—or if you prefer to shop online—you can find a wide variety of bulbs through seed catalogs. Search by flower name until you find the type of bulbs you’re looking for. If the bulbs are organized by growing season, search for “spring-blooming bulbs.” For example, look through the online bulb selection at Gurney’s, Park Seed, or FedCo Seeds.

Here is the corrected text with the spaces added: Excess urine and excess thirst (polyuria and polydipsia) Let's take a closer look at these terms: 1. Excess urine: Also known as polyuria, this condition refers to the increased production and frequent elimination of larger than normal volumes of urine. It often results when an individual's kidneys are producing and expelling more fluid than they should be, which can occur due to a number of reasons. Common causes include diabetes, diuretic use, interstitial nephritis (inflammation of the kidney tissues), excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption, and conditions such as hypercalcemia (high levels of calcium in the blood). 2. Excess thirst: Also known as polydipsia, this condition is characterized by an unusually strong and persistent thirst that leads to excessive consumption of fluids. This elevated fluid intake may sometimes be disproportionate to the amount of fluids lost through urine, sweat, or other means. Some of the common reasons for polydipsia include dehydration, high blood sugar levels (often seen in diabetes), electrolyte imbalances, dry mouth, certain medications, and rare conditions such as diabetes insipidus (a disorder caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone or its insensitivity in the kidneys). When considering polyuria and polydipsia, it is essential to understand that they may be interconnected, with one condition potentially causing or contributing to the other. For instance, untreated diabetes can lead to high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia), causing increased urine production (polyuria), which in turn may lead to increased thirst (polydipsia) as the body attempts to compensate for the fluid loss. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the underlying cause and seek appropriate medical treatment to address these symptoms effectively. Medical professionals typically start with a thorough history and physical examination, followed by laboratory tests, including blood tests and urine analysis, to identify any underlying conditions or abnormalities. Once a diagnosis is made, treatment options will vary depending on the cause. For example, if diabetes is found to be the primary reason for polyuria and polydipsia, the focus should be on monitoring and managing blood sugar levels through medications, dietary changes, and exercise. If dehydration is the culprit, increasing fluid intake and addressing the underlying factors causing dehydration may help alleviate symptoms. In conclusion, excess urine (polyuria) and excess thirst (polydipsia) are medical conditions that may indicate underlying health issues. Proper diagnosis and prompt treatment of the root cause can help manage these symptoms and prevent complications in the long run."},{"instruction":"Use stream of consciousness to answer the following.

The quartet had all been fitness doubts for the match at the Emirates after picking up injuries playing for their respective countries during the recent international break. United's club-record £60million signing Di Maria injured his right foot during Argentina's 1-0 friendly defeat to Portugal on Tuesday, while fellow summer acquisition Shaw came off 66 minutes into England's win in Scotland as a precaution after feeling his left hamstring tighten. Angel di Maria (left) took part in Manchester United training on Friday after recovering from a foot injury. David de Gea (left) and Luke Shaw both also took part in Friday's session after picking up injuries during the international break. Michael Carrick (left) was pictured all smiles as he looks to regain full fitness after hurting his groin. The news of the quartet's return to fitness will be a boost to boss Louis van Gaal (right) ahead of their clash against Arsenal. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney (centre) will be hoping to lead the Red Devils to victory on Saturday. Midfielder Carrick had to withdraw from the Three Lions' set-up after hurting his groin, while Spain international De Gea dislocated a finger - but the pair seemed in good spirits at the club's Aon Complex on Friday. The duo's jovial mood was reciprocated among Van Gaal's squad with many of the Dutchman's charges seen enjoying themselves as they were put through their paces. United's position in the table though is no laughing matter with the club seventh in the Premier League and 13 points adrift of table toppers Chelsea after 11 games of the season. Robin van Persie, who is expected to face a hostile reception when he returns to his former club at the weekend, will be hoping to replicate his international form with Holland after scoring during the international break. Old Trafford skipper Wayne Rooney needs one more goal against the Gunners to become the highest Premier League goalscorer against Arsene Wenger's side. Rooney is currently tied with Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler on 10 league goals against the Gunners with two for Everton and eight for United. Rooney (left) needs one more goal against Arsenal to become the highest Premier League goalscorer against Arsene Wenger's side. Van Gaal (left) will be hoping Robin van Persie can haunt his former club on his return to the Emirates. Speaking ahead of Saturday's clash against Arsenal, Rooney believes former team-mate Danny Welbeck did the right thing by swapping Old Trafford for the Emirates in a £16million move this summer. Many United fans were shocked earlier this year when Van Gaal sanctioned Welbeck's £16million transfer to the north London club. Welbeck is a life-long United fan and joined the club as an eight-year-old having grown up in the Longsight area of Manchester, which is just four miles away from Old Trafford. During his 11-year spell at United, Rooney watched the pacy forward progress from teenage prodigy to first-team striker and admits it will be strange to play against the 23-year-old striker when the two sides meet on Saturday. 'Of course, Danny has been here all of his life,' Rooney told MUTV. 'He is a Manchester lad so it is weird seeing him [there]. But that's football nowadays and players move on.' Welbeck started the vast majority of games on United's successful tour of the United States, however he struggled to get in the starting line-up soon after the season began, with Van Gaal claiming his goal-scoring record was not good enough. Van Gaal (right) and assistant manager Ryan Giggs share a joke as they watch the session unfold at the Aon Training Complex. Belgium international duo Adnan Januzaj (centre) and Marouane Fellaini will both be hoping to start against Arsenal on Saturday. Welbeck scored 29 times in 142 United appearances, but since his move he has found the net on 10 occasions for club and country. Rooney, who played alongside Welbeck for England against Slovenia and Scotland in the recent international break, thinks leaving United has been beneficial for his former team-mate. 'I think, for Danny, and for his own personal career, it was probably the best move for him,' Rooney said. 'He's done great and scored a few goals and is playing well. Danny gives you what he always gives you - a good shift. He works hard for the team. 'At times, as I said to him, he works a bit too hard but he's scoring goals and he's doing well.' Arsenal against United has been one of the biggest fixtures on the calendar in recent years, but neither side is considered a serious title contender this season. Midfield duo Juan Mata (bottom left) and Antonio Valencia (bottom right) are put through their paces on Friday. Anders Lindegaard (left) could make his first Premier League appearance of the season if De Gea fails to recover from his injury. For Rooney, the fixture still brings back fond memories, though. 'We've had some great memories,' the England captain added. Beating them in the Champions League semi-final (in 2009) was probably the highlight.' The same fixture last year ended in a dull 0-0 draw, but given the poor defensive record of both teams, it is unlikely the scoreline will be the same this season. Rooney is hoping United can strike early against their opponents and is expecting a tough match. 'It's always a tight game and whoever gets the first goal normally wins or gets a result,' the 29-year-old said. 'We have to go there with a good team shape and a good unit to make sure we do everything right. 'Arsenal have got a good squad, an exciting squad with a lot of young players and a lot of English players which is great for England. We know they play with a lot of energy and we'll have to be at our best to beat them.' Click here to Like our Manchester United Facebook page. VIDEO Blind's injury exaggerated - Van Gaal.

Possible answers: become a millionaire due to his new found royalty status, kill everyone he knows now that he's the king, the long lost heir to the throne The answer is:","output":"Addison found out he was the king of England today due to an unforeseen and shocking revelation of his royal lineage. This event unfolded as Addison started his day like any other, unaware of the life-changing events that awaited him. Little did he know that a series of events had been set in motion that culminated in the discovery of his rightful claim to the throne. Upon this astonishing disclosure, Addison would face a crossroads in his life where he would have to make decisions that he never imagined. Various possibilities would emerge in front of him that could bring him fortune, power, and authority. Among these possibilities are: 1. Becoming a millionaire due to his newfound royalty status: This is one of the most immediate implications of his newly discovered royal lineage. As king of England, Addison would have access to a vast amount of wealth and resources. The royal family has, historically and presently, possessed vast sums of wealth in the form of property, investments, and other assets. In this capacity, Addison could use this wealth to ensure his financial stability, establish philanthropic initiatives, and contribute to the betterment of the lives of his subjects or anyone he deems deserving of assistance. 2. Kill everyone he knows now that he's the king: This morbid possibility is an extreme consideration and goes against the principles of a just and humane monarch. Assuming the throne often comes with a strong sense of responsibility to not only protect but also improve the conditions of one's subjects. Although absolute power can corrupt absolutely, Addison would have to weigh his actions against the moral and ethical codes of not just his country, but also of the entire world. Resorting to violence and tyranny would likely result in consequences not just for himself, but also for the kingdom and its people. 3. The long-lost heir to the throne: Considering the context, the most plausible explanation for Addison's sudden rise to the monarchy is that he is, indeed, the long-lost heir to the English throne. Royal lineage can often be tracked through historical records, preserved artifacts, and even through genetic testing. It can be suggested that, at some point in history, a branch of the royal family had been lost, forgotten, or actively kept away from the public eye, with Addison being the last descendant of this noble line. As the rightful heir, Addison's claim to the English throne would come as a surprise not just to him, but also to the current reigning monarch and the entire royal family. In this scenario, Addison's primary objective would be to navigate his way through the unique and complex world of royalty, adapting to his role as a monarch, reconciling his past and present identities, and making decisions that align with the best interests of the kingdom. In conclusion, upon the discovery of his royal lineage, Addison would have to face multiple potential prospects – some promising financial stability, others presenting moral quandaries, and several demanding a strong sense of responsibility and leadership. As the king of England, Addison would have a unique and influential platform from which to impact the lives of individuals and the larger world, demanding careful contemplation and consideration of the implications and consequences of his rule."},{"instruction":"I have a new situation: Two competing countries used different energy sources to produce their electricity.

If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Two siblings were going to school.

Options: - room that is upstairs - own home - hotel room - house - found in house Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"To determine the structure in which one normally takes a bath, let's analyze each option in a step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Room that is upstairs: This option is too specific about the location within a structure, but does not indicate which structure one is in. It's possible to have a bathroom upstairs in one's own home or in a hotel, so this option doesn't provide a clear answer. 2. Own home: This is a valid option, as many people have bathrooms in their homes where they can take a bath. However, it's not the only place where someone can take a bath, so we need to consider the other options as well. 3. Hotel room: This is another valid option, as hotel rooms typically have bathrooms with bathtubs or showers. However, not everyone takes a bath in a hotel frequently, so it might not be the most common option for everyone. 4. House: This is similar to the \\"Own home\\" option, as houses are a common residential structure that could contain a bathroom for taking a bath. Just like option 2, this is a valid choice. 5. Found in a house: This option is more about the location within a structure and reiterates the fact that the structure in question is a house. It does not directly answer the question but points to the same conclusion as option 4. Based on the step-by-step reasoning process, the most accurate and common structure in which people take a bath would be their own home (option 2) or a house (option 4). Since a hotel room is a less common setting for most people, the best answer would be either one's own home or a house, as they are both residential structures with bathrooms."},{"instruction":"Endochondral ossification is a normal bone growth process by which cartilage is replaced by bone in the early development of the fetus Please fix the punctuation.","output":"Endochondral ossification is a normal bone growth process.

Man and creature both seek revenge for violence committed against them. Before he has a chance to track down the alien, Kainan the Outlander is captured by a Viking warrior, and is held prisoner in the local village led by King Rothgar. As the Moorwen ravages the Viking lands, killing everything in its path, Kainan forms an alliance with the primitive but fierce warriors. Whilst trying to hunt for the Moorwen, war brews among the Vikings, which culminated with both sides taking immense losses. As the enemy Vikings retreat into the forests, the Moorwen strikes, leaving the vikings no choice but to run for help to their once close enemies. Together, the two sides attempt to destroy the Moorwen as a single band of Vikings. The Vikings thus construct a pit filled with oil to lure the Moorwen inside and plan to ignite the fuel, burning the Moorwen, with the help of Kainan. The plan to incinerate the Moorwen fails, leaving the village to take massive casualties, and with the surprise that the Moorwen had given birth to a new, younger Moorwen, which surprises the Vikings from behind and kills the Viking Leader in the process. This leaves the villages in fear and its warriors demoralised, most of the vikings leave the village in search of a new home and safety. Kainan and the remaining loyal warriors stand together to destroy the Moorwen.

There is evidence to suggest that, in therapeutic situations, music can be more effective at prompting relaxation than verbal stimuli (which is distracting) because music is processed primarily in the non-verbal sections of our brains. . Aromatherapy utilizes essential oils derived from various herbs, fruits, bark, and flowers. In doing so, aromatherapy can positively affect mood and emotions by making a connection between your olfactory senses and the limbic system in your brain. Lavender and lemon are two of the most popular oils used for relaxation and stress relief. Check online or talk to an aromatherapy specialist to determine which additional scents or blends might work for you. In an aromatherapeutic massage, the essential oil is placed in “carrier oil”—an unscented or lightly scented oil—that is safe for skin application. As the massage oil is heated through the friction of the massage, the aroma of the essential oil fills the air. Aromatherapy burners can be purchased and placed in any room in the house. Some are plugged into outlets, while others fit around the tops of lamp light bulbs. The heat from the bulb releases the calming essential oil scent into the room. Restorative yoga poses, such as the child's pose or the corpse pose, may ease stress by helping to focus on the breath and promoting total physical relaxation. Power poses such as the eagle pose help ease stress by focusing the practitioner on balance while stretching tight shoulders and backs. Dancing is another great way to release those endorphins and calm your nerves. Dance has many health benefits, including better physical fitness and increased memory (think about all those ballet positions!), but is also valuable as a social activity.

What is required to be good at driving cars? Options: - have fun - concentrate - park - listen to radio - speeding","output":"To determine which option is most important for being good at driving cars, let's analyze each of them step-by-step. 1. Have fun: While enjoying the driving experience can make it more pleasant, it is not a requirement for being good at driving cars. So, this option is not the most important one. 2. Concentrate: Being able to focus and pay attention to the road, traffic signs, and other vehicles is a crucial aspect of driving safely and effectively. Concentration helps you make better decisions, anticipate potential hazards, and respond quickly to any unexpected situations. Therefore, this option is essential for being good at driving cars. 3. Park: Good parking skills are just a part of being good at driving cars, as it involves maneuvering the car in confined spaces. Although it's essential, this option does not encompass the overall skillset required to be a good driver. 4. Listen to the radio: This option is not necessary for being good at driving cars. Listening to the radio can provide useful traffic information and entertainment, but it does not have a direct impact on driving abilities. 5. Speeding: Speeding is not a requirement for driving well; in fact, it can lead to dangerous situations and accidents. Safe and responsible driving involves adhering to speed limits and adjusting your speed according to road conditions.

Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral.... Answer:","output":"The first name of the person whose influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial is \\"Stefan\\". This can be gathered from the first sentence describing Stefan Lochner and his substantial influence as a German painter during the International Gothic period."},{"instruction":"Yes / no, is the following a verifiable fact? \\"Breadfruit originates in Asia and has become popular in Polynesia and other locations around the world.\\" Chain of thought and solution for this question is:","output":"To determine whether the statement \\"Breadfruit originates in Asia and has become popular in Polynesia and other locations around the world\\" is a verifiable fact, we must break down the statement into components, research the components, and finally, deduce if the given statement can be verified.

Pat Quinn told reporters. Officials from the departments of Defense, Justice, Homeland Security and the federal Bureau of Prisons will visit the Thomson Correctional Center on Monday, the officials said. Quinn's office on Saturday said the officials would see whether the \\"virtually vacant, state-of-the-art facility\\" in Thomson, about 150 miles west of Chicago, could be of use to the Bureau of Prisons. The","output":"proposal of housing federal prisoners, including some detainees from Guantanamo Bay, in the largely vacant maximum-security prison in northern Illinois has been met with enthusiasm from state officials. They believe that this move could provide an economic boost to the region, which has been struggling for some time now. Governor Pat Quinn has expressed support for the proposal, stating that it would be beneficial for the state in terms of its economy and public safety. The purpose of the visit from officials of the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and the federal Bureau of Prisons is to evaluate the Thomson Correctional Center as a potential site for housing federal prisoners. Located roughly 150 miles west of Chicago, the facility has remained virtually empty since its construction. Given its state-of-the-art infrastructure and secure nature, it presents a viable option for the federal government in its quest to find a suitable place to detain Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other federal inmates. There are several reasons why this proposal may be beneficial for both the state and the federal government: 1. Economic benefits: The influx of federal prisoners and the increased operational requirements of the Thomson Correctional Center would create an immediate need for jobs in the local area, both at the prison and in ancillary service providers. This would lead to an increase in local employment, potentially reducing the region's unemployment rate and providing a much-needed economic boost. 2. Improving public safety: Housing federal prisoners in a maximum-security facility like the Thomson Correctional Center would improve public safety by ensuring that high-risk inmates are secured in a controlled environment. The prison's maximum-security status means it is equipped with robust security features designed to minimize the risk of escape and maintain order within its walls. 3. Cost-efficiency: For the federal government, the use of an existing, underutilized facility like the Thomson Correctional Center represents a cost-efficient solution to address the need for additional prisoner housing. Investing in a new facility would require significant funding and time, whereas utilizing the existing prison offers the advantage of minimal new infrastructure costs and a faster implementation timeline. 4. Alleviating concerns about Guantanamo Bay detainees: The ongoing discussion about the future of Guantanamo Bay and its detainees has been a topic of debate for years. Housing some of these detainees in a secure facility like the Thomson Correctional Center may help to address the ethical and legal concerns that have been raised about their continued detention in Guantanamo. However, there are also potential drawbacks and concerns surrounding this proposal: 1. Public opposition: Some residents may be concerned about the potential risks that come with housing high-risk federal prisoners and Guantanamo Bay detainees in their community. They might worry about the possibility of escape attempts, increased crime in the area due to the presence of the prison, or negative perceptions associated with having a maximum-security facility in their vicinity. 2. Political implications: The proposal may be met with resistance from lawmakers who oppose the relocation of Guantanamo Bay detainees to American soil. They may argue that doing so could pose a national security risk or set a dangerous precedent. In conclusion, the proposal to house federal prisoners and Guantanamo Bay detainees in the Thomson Correctional Center has clear economic and public safety benefits for the state of Illinois. Still, it may also face challenges in terms of public opposition and political contention. As federal officials visit the facility and evaluate its viability as a location to house these prisoners, it is important that the benefits and concerns are carefully considered and potentially mitigated to ensure a balanced approach to resolving this issue."},{"instruction":"Write a text based on \\"rice reiterates u.s. opposition to referendum on taiwan 's un membership\\" Text:","output":"Once upon a time, there was a big country named the United States, and they had a friend named Rice.

This is the first cartoon that Donald Duck and Goofy appear without Mickey Mouse . - Donald Duck is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is most famous for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002. He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre. - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney (December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. - Goofy is a funny-animal cartoon character created in 1932 at Walt Disney Productions. Goofy is a tall, anthropomorphic dog with a Southern drawl, and typically wears a turtle neck and vest, with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled fedora. Goofy is a close friend of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and is one of Disney's most recognizable characters. He is normally characterized as extremely clumsy and dimwitted, yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as intuitive, and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way. - Mickey Mouse is a funny animal cartoon character and the official mascot of The Walt Disney Company. He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey has become one of the world's most recognizable characters.

Question: What was the significance of the Rosetta Stone in understanding ancient Egyptian history, specifically the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs? Answer: The Rosetta Stone, discovered in 1799, is a granodiorite stele inscribed with a decree issued at Memphis, Egypt, in 196 BC during the reign of King Ptolemy V. The significance of the Rosetta Stone lies in the fact that it provided scholars with the key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs, which had remained a mystery for over a thousand years. The Rosetta Stone contains the same text in three different scripts: Hieroglyphic, Demotic, and Ancient Greek. The presence of these parallel scripts allowed experts to use the known Greek language as a basis for translating the other texts. By determining that each script conveyed the same message, scholars surmised that the hieroglyphs and Demotic texts were also translatable. French scholar Jean-François Champollion played a pivotal role in deciphering the Rosetta Stone's hieroglyphs. In 1822, after years of research, he became the first person to successfully decipher hieroglyphs by identifying the phonetics and grammar used in ancient Egyptian writing. He achieved this by recognizing that some hieroglyphs represented sounds or letters, while others conveyed ideas or concepts. With this groundbreaking discovery, historians were able to translate other ancient Egyptian texts and significantly expand our understanding of ancient Egyptian history, culture, and religion. Overall, the Rosetta Stone has had an enormous impact on the field of Egyptology and our knowledge of ancient Egypt. Its discovery allowed scholars to unlock the secrets of hieroglyphs and paved the way for a more comprehensive understanding of this fascinating civilization."},{"instruction":"Oropharyngeal cancers (cancers of the middle part of the throat, including the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils): About 70 percent of oropharyngeal cancers are caused by HPV.

The second Republic of Yucatán emerged when the federal pact signed by Yucatán and endorsed in the Constitution of Yucatán of 1825 was broken by the centralist government of Mexico since 1835. In 1841 the state of Tabasco decreed its separation from Mexico and Miguel Barbachano, then governor of Yucatán, sent a commission headed by Justo Sierra O'Reilly to meet with Tabasco authorities to propose the creation of an independent federal republic from Mexico formed by the two states. The idea failed when Tabasco rejoined Mexico in 1842. On August 22, 1846, Mexican interim president José Mariano Salas restored the 1824 constitution and the federalism. Two years later, during the government of president José Joaquín de Herrera, Miguel Barbachano ordered the reinstatement of Yucatán to Mexico under the Constitution of Yucatán of 1825. A decisive factor for the reinstatement was the Caste War, which forced Yucatán to seek outside help. In 1852 due to internal struggles between opposing political factions, was created the Territory of Campeche. On April 29, 1863, during the government of Benito Juárez, Campeche gained its current status as an independent state.

The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer. As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows. The answer to this question is:","output":"Professor Kristan's mother was bitten by a vampire bat in a cave in Africa."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Article: Death is natural, but do you have any idea of the process of dying? Modern scientists divide the process of dying into two phases --- clinical or temporary death and biological death. Clinical death occurs when the vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, have ceased to function, but have not suffered permanent damage. The organism can still be revived . Biological death occurs when changes in the organism lead to the \\"breaking up\\" of vital cells and tissues. Death is then unchangeable and final. Scientists have been seeking a way to prolong the period of clinical death so that the organism can remain alive before biological death occurs. The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism, combined with narcotic sleep. By slowing down the body's metabolism , cooling delays the processes leading to biological death. To illustrate how this works, scientists performed an experiment on a six-year-old female monkey called Keta. The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic. Then they surrounded her body with ice-bags and began checking her body temperature. When it had dropped to 28 degrees the scientists began draining blood from an artery. The monkey's blood pressure decreased and an hour later both the heart and breathing stopped: clinical death set in. For twenty minutes Keta remained in this state. Her temperature dropped to 22 degrees. At this point the scientists pumped blood into an artery in the direction of the heart and started artificial breathing. After two minutes Keta's heart became active once more. After fifteen minutes, spontaneous breathing began, and after four hours Keta opened her eyes and lifted her head. After six hours, when the scientists tried to give her a penicillin injection, Keta seized the syringe and ran with it around the room. Her behavior differed little from that of a healthy animal. Question: How did the scientists put Keta into clinical death? Yes or no, is the answer \\"By putting her to sleep, lowering her temperature and draining her blood.\\"?

DNA is the reason that we look like our parents, because we get some of their DNA to make our own. People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Mr. Mendel discovered why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things called \\"genes\\" in our body. In 1953, two scientists, Watson and Crick, found out that genes are really messages. They're written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, another two scientists found the first \\"word\\" that they could understand in that language. It shows how DNA tells the cell to build its parts.

In the United States, the verdict in criminal cases must be unanimous. A non-unanimous verdict results in a hung jury which in turn forces a mistrial. The question they are deciding is whether the defendant, a teenaged boy from a city slum, murdered his father. The jury is further instructed that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence. Under current American criminal law, a defendant must first be found guilty, and then the jury in the sentencing phase must find an aggravating circumstance and unanimously agree to recommend the death penalty, if the state has the death penalty.[citation needed] The jury of twelve retires to the jury room, where they begin to become acquainted with their personalities and discuss the case. The story revolves around their difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict, mainly because of the personal prejudices of several of the jurors. An initial vote is taken and eleven of the jurors vote for conviction. Juror number 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence presented is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation, upon which he questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the fact that the knife used in the murder is not as unusual as the testimony indicates (he produces an identical one from his pocket), and the overall shady circumstances. Having argued several points, Juror 8 requests another vote, this time by secret ballot.

Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media is a 2005 autobiography from Harper Perennial documenting his career and philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel - Why Everything You Know Is Wrong, which was published in 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Stossel's third book No, They Can't: Why Government Fails - But Individuals Succeed. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does. With financial support from the libertarian Palmer R. Chitester Fund, Stossel and ABC News launched a series of educational materials for public schools in 1999 entitled \\"Stossel in the Classroom\\". It was taken over in 2006 by the Center for Independent Thought and releases a new DVD of teaching materials annually. In 2006, Stossel and ABC released Teaching Tools for Economics, a video series based on the National Council of Economics Education standards. Since February 2011, Stossel has written a weekly newspaper column for Creators Syndicate. His articles appear in such online publications as Newsmax, Reason, and Townhall. what types of government policies?","output":"In his third book, \\"No, They Can't: Why Government Fails - But Individuals Succeed,\\" John F. Stossel argues that various government policies meant to solve problems often end up producing new ones. While the quote from the article does not specify every type of government policy Stossel addresses in his book, it's clear that he has a general skepticism about the efficiency and effectiveness of government intervention. Given Stossel's libertarian leaning, it's likely that the types of government policies he critiques may include those related to economic regulations, social services, and government spending. Examples could be policies governing minimum wage, business regulations, taxation, healthcare, and welfare programs. Stossel emphasizes his belief in the efficiency of free individuals and the private sector performing tasks that are often assigned to the government. Drawing from his philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism, as described in his 2005 autobiography, \\"Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media,\\" Stossel is also known for his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. These themes further point towards the types of government policies that Stossel critiques in his work."},{"instruction":"Lizzy: Dan's skateboarding helmet has ten more craters than Daniel's ski helmet. Rin's snorkel helmet has 15 more craters than Dan's and Daniel's helmets combined. If Rin's helmet has 75 craters, how many craters are in Dan's helmet?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"Let's break this down step by step using algebraic expressions. Let x be the number of craters in Dan's skateboarding helmet, and y be the number of craters in Daniel's ski helmet. According to the problem: 1) Dan's skateboarding helmet has 10 more craters than Daniel's ski helmet: x = y + 10 2) Rin's snorkel helmet has 15 more craters than Dan's and Daniel's helmets combined: 75 = x + y + 15 Now, we need to find the value of x (the number of craters in Dan's helmet) from these two equations. First, we can rearrange equation 1) to get y in terms of x: y = x - 10 Now, substitute this expression (x - 10) for y in equation 2) and solve for x: 75 = x + (x - 10) + 15 75 = 2x + 5 Now, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: 70 = 2x Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 35 So Dan's skateboarding helmet has 35 craters."},{"instruction":"Given the question: A few insects, such as mayflies and some moths, never eat. That's because their lives are over in just a few hours or days. Once these insects become adults, they lay eggs, and then die. On the other hand, some insects are very healthy eaters. A silkworm eats enough leaves to increase its weight more than 4,000 times in just 56 days, as the silkworm increases in size about 10,000 times since birth. A locust eats its own weight in plants every day. Just imagine eating your own weight in food every day. You probably couldn't. You would most likely get very sick even if you tried. John and Mary were studying insects. John liked to study insects that never eat, while Mary decided to study insects that are very healthy eaters. Which person studied less about moths? The answer is:","output":"John studied less about moths. To understand the reasoning behind this answer, we can look at the preferences of John and Mary while studying insects. John liked to study insects that never eat, which includes certain types of moths, such as the adult moths that only live for a few days, lay eggs, and then die. On the other hand, Mary decided to study insects that are very healthy eaters. This preference of hers would include insects such as silkworms which are voracious eaters and have an immense appetite for leaves. It is important to note that not all moths fall under the category of insects that never eat. Only some species of moths have such characteristics like the mayflies. However, Mary's focus on healthy eaters means she is exploring a broader range of insects that include moths as well as other species of healthy eating insects. Considering the above explanation, we can deduce that John's study of moths is limited only to the species that never eat. In contrast, Mary would study the moths that are healthy eaters in addition to other insects that fall under the same category. Hence, John studies less about moths compared to Mary."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","output":"Sentence: The young artist painted a soothing landscape on the sunny afternoon by the river.

(a). negative (b). positive. Generate a (a). review for a place","output":"Title: Disappointing Experience - High Expectations Let Down I had high hopes for my visit to this place, but, unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience. From the moment I entered, the atmosphere was underwhelming, and it gradually went downhill from there. My review details the numerous aspects where I believe the establishment fell short and could use significant improvement. To begin with, the venue's interior design left a lot to be desired. The lighting was dull, making the space feel gloomy and unwelcoming. The furnishings were dated and worn out, detracting from the overall ambiance of the venue. To add to this, the layout of the seating arrangement was disorganized and uncomfortable, with tables situated too closely together, making for an intrusive dining environment. Moving on to the service, it was far from what one would expect from a reputed place. The staff members appeared disinterested and poorly trained. Upon being greeted at the entrance, the host took an unusually long time to find a suitable table for us, making us feel unwelcomed. When we finally did get seated, our server was inattentive and unfamiliar with the menu, which made it challenging for us to make informed choices based on their recommendations. As for the food, it was certainly the most disappointing aspect of the experience. The menu options seemed limited, lacking in terms of creativity and variety. When the dishes finally arrived after a long wait, they were underwhelming in presentation and portion sizes. The taste was bland, and the quality of the ingredients left a lot to be desired. The dishes lacked the balance and complexity of flavors one would expect at a high-quality establishment. This was particularly evident in the main course, where the meat was overcooked and excessively dry, while the vegetables were undercooked and lackluster in flavor. Additionally, the overall hygiene and cleanliness within the establishment were not up to par. The restroom facilities were in poor condition, with unpleasant odors and insufficiently stocked essentials. Even the table linens and cutlery showed signs of wear and previous usage, with faint stains and scratches that detracted from the dining experience. Lastly, considering the numerous issues outlined above, I found the prices to be unjustifiably steep. It was difficult to justify paying such a premium for an experience that failed to meet basic expectations in terms of food, service, and ambiance. In conclusion, my visit to this place was a letdown, marred by poor ambiance, inattentive service, subpar food quality, and high prices that did not align with the overall experience. I cannot recommend this establishment in its current state, and I sincerely hope the management takes notice of these concerns and addresses them to improve the venue for future patrons."},{"instruction":"Snížit daňové zatížení osob s nízkými příjmy, mimo jiné zlepšením účinnosti ekologických daní.

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Context: The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The country covers about 9,980,000 square kilometers and six of the world's 24 time areas as well. There are two official languages spoken in Canada: French and English. Many people can speak both English and French. More than 60% of Canadians speak English as their language. About 25% of the Canadians speak French. In one province of Canada where French is the common language, the programmes on TV and radios as well as the teaching in schools are all in French. Today, Chinese has become the first inofficial language in Canada. Canada's climate is not as cold all year around as some may believe. In winter, temperatures fall below freezing point throughout most of Canada. In summer, the southern provinces often experience high levels of temperatures that can reach over 30degC regularly. The weather in Canada is just like the weather in China. It is rather cold in the north while it is fairly warm in the south. Winters in the north last long with snow for half a year. As the cold northern climate, only one-fifth of the land is suitable for farming. As it is known to all, Canada has one-third of the world's supply of fresh water. It has many great lakes. There are five great lakes in the south. And there are many others, especially in the north. It is also rich in natural resources, such as coal, oil, natural gas of which Canadians make use to produce energy. People of northern Canada are called Inuit , who came from Asia and settled in Canada about 4,000 years ago. They used to travel around from place to place with teams of dogs which pulled their baggage. Now, they seldom move. There are about 2,500 Inuit in all.

They recorded their debut album, Please Please Me, in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, \\"Twist and Shout\\". The Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With a few exceptions, one being the album title itself, Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: \\"We were just writing songs ... pop songs with no more thought of them than that – to create a sound.

Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr. and Ben Stiller in a scene from \\"Tropic Thunder\\". REUTERS/DreamWorks Pictures “We are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population,” said Peter Wheeler, spokesman for Special Olympics, one of 22 disability groups nationwide protesting the satire. The film, directed by Stiller, will be released on Wednesday by Viacom Inc’s Paramount Pictures and its DreamWorks unit. The groups plan to picket the movie’s premiere on Monday evening in Los Angeles’s Westwood community. “That will be the start of a nationwide protest,” said Wheeler. “We will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film.” He said the groups are particularly offended by the film’s repeated use of the word “retard” regarding a character, Simple Jack, played by Stiller in a subplot about an actor. Representatives of the Special Olympics, the Arc of the United States, the National Down Syndrome Congress, the American Association of People with Disabilities and other groups met with studio executives last week to discuss the film, but DreamWorks did not make any changes. Peter Berns, executive director the Arc, said in a memo the groups presented various ideas to the studio, from requesting an apology to fixing the film before its release, to producing a national educational campaign. Chip Sullivan, a spokesman for DreamWorks said: “We have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future. However no changes or cuts to the film will be made... “‘Tropic Thunder’ is an R-rated comedy that satirizes Hollywood and its excesses, and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over-the top characters in ridiculous situations. The film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities,” he said. The film also features Robert Downey Jr. as a white actor who changes his skin color to play a black soldier. Sullivan said that prior to the meetings, DreamWorks had taken down an online promotion, removing references to Simple Jack it felt could appear offensive when taken out of context. The film was shown in more than 250 promotional screenings around the country since April. ||||| Shaun White Apologizes to Special Olympics For 'Insensitive' Costume Shaun White Apologizes to Special Olympics for 'Insensitive' Simple Jack Costume EXCLUSIVE 3:58 PM PT -- Shaun White has pulled the photo of his \\"Simple Jack\\" costume off of his social and has issued an apology. \\"I owe everyone in the Special Olympics community an apology for my poor choice of Halloween costume the other night.\\" \\"It was a last minute decision.

Answer:","output":"The sound generated by backflow through a valve is often referred to as \\"water hammer\\" or \\"fluid hammer\\" noise. This sound occurs when the fluid flow in a closed piping system changes direction suddenly, causing a pressure wave to propagate through the fluid. It is generally perceived as a loud knocking, thudding, or banging noise, which can be abrupt or repetitive depending on the situation. Water hammer is the result of the sudden stop or reversal of fluid flow, which creates a pressure surge within the piping system. This pressure surge can cause rapid fluctuations in the fluid's velocity, leading to shockwaves that travel through the fluid and often manifest as noticeable noise emissions. The principal components involved in the generation of this noise are the mass and compressibility of the fluid, the speed at which the fluid flows, and the pipe's geometry and material properties. Several factors and conditions can contribute to the creation of water hammer noise: 1. Rapid valve closure: If a valve is closed too quickly, the fluid's kinetic energy has inadequate time to dissipate, causing the fluid to abruptly stop and generate a pressure spike within the piping system. Since the sound is produced by shockwaves generated by oscillations in fluid pressure, the magnitude of the noise is often directly proportional to how fast the valve is closed. 2. Pump shutdown or startups: When a pump is suddenly started or stopped, it leads to rapid changes in fluid flow and pressure. The pressure fluctuations resulting from these changes in fluid movement can cause water hammer noise. 3. Pipe geometry and material: The noise generated by backflow through a valve can be significantly affected by the piping system's properties. Pipe size, length, material, and the presence of curves, bends, or other obstructions can all influence the sound transmission and how the noise is perceived by the human ear. 4. Entrapped air or vapor: If air or vapor gets trapped within the pipeline, it can amplify the hammer effect by increasing the fluid's compressibility, leading to more significant pressure surges. The compression and expansion of the trapped gas or vapor can significantly increase the water hammer noise level. 5. Pressure reducing valves: In some cases, malfunctioning or improperly designed pressure reducing valves can create conditions that lead to water hammer noise. If these valves do not regulate the flow and pressure accurately, it can cause rapid changes in fluid flow that lead to significant pressure surges. The sound generated by backflow through a valve can be mitigated or entirely eliminated with proper system design, installation, and maintenance. Some common methods to reduce or prevent water hammer noise include: 1. Slowing the valve closure speed: Closing the valve at a slower rate can help dissipate the fluid's kinetic energy more efficiently, diminishing the pressure surge and associated noise. 2. Installing surge arrestors or air chambers: Installing devices such as surge arrestors or air chambers along critical sections of the piping system can help absorb the pressure fluctuations, reducing the intensity of water hammer noise. 3. Ensuring proper pipe design and support: Using appropriate pipe materials, ensuring proper pipe sizing, and providing adequate supports for the pipes can prevent excessive vibration and noise transmission. 4. Regular maintenance and inspection: Regular system maintenance can help identify potential issues, such as air or vapor entrapment and malfunctioning pressure-reducing valves, that could contribute to water hammer noise. In conclusion, the sound generated by backflow through a valve is typically referred to as water hammer noise. This noise results from sudden changes in fluid flow and pressure within a closed piping system, creating shockwaves that manifest as knocking or thudding sounds. Understanding the factors that contribute to water hammer noise and implementing proper system design and maintenance can effectively mitigate or eliminate this phenomenon."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I heard that Austin got Sasha money for her anniversary because they didn't know what else to gift her.

In middle adulthood, people such as Pat begin to experience physical signs of aging, including declines in vision, strength, and reaction time. Engaging in regular physical activity can help counteract these declines and promote overall health. Long walks can also help reduce the risk of chronic illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart diseases, and cancer, which are more frequently diagnosed during this stage of life and are the leading causes of death in middle adulthood. Tammy, being in the latter part of early adulthood, is approaching middle adulthood and will benefit from maintaining an active lifestyle as well. Despite being younger, it is essential to build up healthy habits early on to ensure a smooth transition to middle adulthood and mitigate the risk of developing age-related health issues. In conclusion, Pat has already reached middle adulthood at 60 years old, and Tammy, at 32 years old, will soon be entering this stage of life. By participating in long walks together, they both can foster a sense of connection and enhance their overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"Cells cannot survive without oxygen, and plants stabilize soils and oxygenate the atmosphere.

Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first Eurovision semi-final.Until 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career. The introduction of weekly semi-finals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semi-finals and final since 2003. Melodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as Anne-Lie Rydé, Tommy Körberg, and Lisa Nilsson. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including Baccara, Alannah Myles, Katrina Leskanich, and Cornelis Vreeswijk. Melodifestivalen participants have also represented—and unsuccessfully tried to represent—other countries at Eurovision. While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common, most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success. The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, \\"Symfonin\\" by Loa Falkman, topped the Swedish singles chart. The most recent occurrence was 2016 with Samir &..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer to your friend's question is that the song \\"Symfonin\\" by Loa Falkman reached the top of the Swedish singles charts in 1990, despite finishing last at Melodifestivalen that year. Melodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, and the competition's impact on the Swedish charts means an artist doesn't necessarily have to win the contest to earn significant domestic record sales."},{"instruction":"Goal: safely clean dirty light bulbs Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"As an AI, I need you to provide me with the methods you are considering, so that I can evaluate and suggest you the most reasonable method for safely cleaning dirty light bulbs.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Halberstadt is a town in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, the capital of Harz district.

Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Reform Judaism (also known as Liberal Judaism or Progressive Judaism) is a major Jewish denomination which emphasizes the evolving nature of the religion, the superiority of its ethical aspects to the ceremonial ones, and a belief in a continuous revelation not centered on the theophany at Mount Sinai. It is characterized by a lesser stress on ritual and personal observance, regarding Jewish Law as of basically non-binding nature, and great openness to external influences and progressive values. The origins of Reform Judaism lay in 19th-century Germany, where its early principles were formulated by Rabbi Abraham Geiger and his associates. Its greatest center today is in North America. - Abraham Geiger (24 May 181023 October 1874) was a German rabbi and scholar, considered the founding father of Reform Judaism. Emphasizing its constant development along history and universalist traits, Geiger sought to reformulate received forms and design what he regarded as a religion compliant with modern times. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union.

Starting on Sept. 8, that registration process will require a 14 fee, paid by credit or debit card. ESTA approval, which went into effect in early 2009, allows travelers to enter the United States without a full travel visa, which can cost over 100. The ESTA authorization lasts for two years (or until the individual’s passport expires), and is valid for multiple entries. This creates another potential roadblock for visitors from ESTA-participating countries, who will now need both Internet access and a MasterCard, Visa, American Express or Discover card (or a debit card within those networks). (The C.B.P. says it is looking into expanding to other forms of payment.) The bulk of the 14 fee will fund tourism promotion, with the remainder going toward operation of the ESTA program. Of course, visitors from those participating countries — mostly European and far East Asian — will still need a valid passport for entry. ||||| Summary:","output":"Starting from September 8, travelers flying to the United States from certain countries are required to pay a 14 \\"operational and travel promotion\\" fee if they do not possess a U.S. visa.

Would \\"Most of the regulations on business were ended about 1975–85, except for the regulation of Wall Street by the Securities and Exchange Commission , which still exists.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"No, the information provided in the statement \\"Most of the regulations on business were ended about 1975–85, except for the regulation of Wall Street by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which still exists.\\" is not a reasonable answer to the question about when Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) was elected as president. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, was first elected as president on November 8, 1932. He served four terms in office from March 4, 1933, until his death on April 12, 1945. His presidency was marked by significant events and policies, including the implementation of the New Deal to combat the Great Depression as well as leading the United States during most of World War II. The statement provided seems to pertain to the general deregulation movement in the United States that took place in the 1970s and 1980s. It is essential to note that the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) occurred during Roosevelt's tenure as president as a part of the New Deal measures. The SEC was established by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which aimed to regulate the securities industry and prevent fraudulent practices following the 1929 stock market crash. So, to provide an appropriate and detailed answer to the question: Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected as the president of the United States on November 8, 1932. During his tenure as president, FDR implemented numerous policies and reforms, including the aforementioned New Deal that introduced the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934. The SEC continues to exist and serves as a regulatory agency for Wall Street and securities markets. However, the information regarding deregulation in the 1970s and 1980s is not directly related to FDR's election or presidency and is more relevant to economic policy changes several decades after his time in office."},{"instruction":"Timorinkaljumesikko Translate to English","output":"As an AI language model, I will work through this task in a step-by-step manner: 1.

In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.

Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example). - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania.

European-introduced diseases devastated the native population of Petén, with the effects of disease compounded by the psychological impact of defeat. The population around Lake Petén Itzá numbered between 20,000 and 40,000 in 1697. By 1714, a census recorded just over 3,000 individuals in Spanish Petén, including non-Indians. This number would not have included the so-called \\"wild\\" Maya living in the forest far from Spanish administration and control. By 1700 the new colonial capital of Petén was mainly inhabited by colonists, soldiers and convicts. During the second half of the 18th century, adult male Indians were heavily taxed, often being forced into debt peonage. Western Petén and neighbouring Chiapas remained sparsely populated, and the Maya inhabitants avoided contact with the Spanish. San José, on the northwest shore of lake Petén Itzá, is the home of the last surviving speakers of the Itza language. The surname Kowoj still survives, but the Kowoj and Itza have fully merged and no longer exist as separate ethnicities. In modern times there is a history of conflict between San José and neighbouring San Andrés , and this mutual hostility probably represents ancient hostility between the Itza and the Kowoj.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"To determine the most reasonable method to accomplish the goal of stopping pain from a sore throat, let us explore a few popular methods and their effectiveness: 1. Gargling with warm salt water: Gargling with warm salt water helps to kill bacteria, break down throat secretions, and reduce inflammation in the throat. This, in turn, can help alleviate pain and discomfort caused by a sore throat. 2. Drinking warm liquids: Consuming warm liquids such as hot tea, warm water, or broth can soothe the throat and provide temporary relief from pain. The heat helps to reduce inflammation and open up the airways, making it easier to breathe and swallow. 3. Using throat lozenges or cough drops: Throat lozenges or cough drops containing menthol, eucalyptus, or benzocaine can provide a soothing cooling effect and temporarily numb the pain in the throat. While it is not a long-term solution, it can offer short-term relief. 4. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications: Non-prescription pain relievers like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen can help reduce inflammation and pain associated with a sore throat. Additionally, over-the-counter throat sprays containing phenol or benzocaine can help numb the throat and provide temporary relief. 5. Rest: Giving your body ample time to rest and recover can work wonders in reducing pain and speeding up the healing process. A weak immune system can prolong your discomfort, so getting proper sleep and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are essential in overcoming a sore throat. 6. Humidifying the air: Dry air can aggravate a sore throat. Using a humidifier to add moisture to the air or taking a steamy shower can help provide relief by reducing throat irritation and discomfort. 7. Drinking plenty of fluids: Staying hydrated is essential for overall health and can help soothe an irritated throat. Drinking water, herbal teas, and clear broths can keep the throat moist and help alleviate pain. Each of these methods can provide relief from a sore throat to varying degrees. While the effectiveness may vary from person to person, a combination of these methods would be the most reasonable approach to accomplish the goal of stopping pain from a sore throat. For instance, gargling with warm salt water and drinking warm liquids can help reduce inflammation and provide immediate relief. Using throat lozenges or cough drops, taking OTC medications, and hydrating oneself with plenty of fluids can also significantly help with pain management. Finally, creating a conducive environment by humidifying the air, getting proper rest, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle will help support your immune system and speed up the healing process."},{"instruction":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: island ended hopes of qualifying for a major tournament","output":"Step 1: Read the sentence and understand its meaning.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the proposed perturbation does have an effect on the process. Diabetes is a disease where the body's ability to produce or respond to the hormone insulin is compromised, resulting in abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates and elevated levels of glucose in the blood. In both types of diabetes (type 1 and type 2), the effectiveness or availability of insulin is affected. In type 1, the body doesn't produce enough insulin, often requiring patients to manually inject insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the body doesn't use insulin properly and gradually loses its ability to produce adequate amounts, often requiring dietary changes, oral medication, or insulin injections. In both cases, a person with diabetes may need to use more insulin to maintain normal sugar levels.

To find the longest common subsequence in the lists A and B, first initialize a dynamic programming matrix, dp. The dimensions of the matrix are (len(A) + 1) x (len(B) + 1). 3. Iterate over each row, i, starting from the second row and each column, j, starting from the second column of the matrix dp. If the items at A[i-1] and B[j-1] are equal, set the value of dp[i][j] to dp[i-1][j-1] + 1. Otherwise, set dp[i][j] to the maximum value between dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1]. This process will help you fill the matrix while finding the length of the longest common subsequence. 4. After filling the dynamic programming matrix, the value at the bottom-right cell will represent the length of the longest common subsequence of lists A and B. 5.

Question: What did Darwin theorize? Context: Evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \\"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\\" and coining the term \\"Darwinism\\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science. Later, the German morphologist Ernst Haeckel would convince Huxley that comparative anatomy and palaeontology could be used to reconstruct evolutionary genealogies. Answer:","output":"Darwin theorized the concept of evolution through the process of natural selection. He proposed that species gradually change over time, and that those best adapted to their environment have a better chance of survival and reproduction, thereby passing on their advantageous traits to future generations. This theory challenged the widely accepted view at the time of natural theology and instead promoted scientific naturalism as a way to understand and explain the natural world.

You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.

Some schools have done better in protecting students' privacy and encouraging them. In American schools, teachers post test results on the wall.

I fell in love with him,\\" Hill told WJLA in July. The Virginia pair met 10 years ago while buying lottery tickets—splitting a 2,500 winner—and married earlier this year. But that union—an interracial one in a state that banned such marriages for decades—has instigated a court battle over Hill's estate and could end with the couple splitting up, the AP reports. Hill is legally incapacitated, and a judge has ruled daughter Rebecca Wright shouldn't have facilitated the marriage without the court's permission. Wright's sister, Patricia Barber, claims the union complicates the division of Hill's 475,000 estate, because now Harrison could inherit a portion. \\"She wants to sell my mother's house. She wants the money,\\" Wright tells WUSA9. Should Barber win, Hill would have to move in with her or be put in a nursing home—either way, she and Harrison would be separated. \\"They're not gonna separate us. No, we're not gonna let them,\\" Harrison tells the station. The judge agrees on that score: Breaking them up could \\"create a circumstance in Ms. Hill's life that she doesn't deserve,\\" he ruled. To protect Hill's interests, an attorney has been appointed and her daughters removed as guardians. Wright believes ageism and racism are also at play in her sister's court action, telling WJLA that mindsets haven't changed.

However, the Virginia couple, who met 10 years ago while buying lottery tickets and married earlier this year, have proven that the heart knows no boundaries. Yet, their love story is also tainted by an ongoing court battle that could threaten their life together. A fateful encounter over lottery tickets started it all. Hill told WJLA in July, \\"He touched my heart. I fell in love with him.\\" Their friendship grew over the years, and these two lovebirds decided to tie the knot. Noteworthy here is that their union is an interracial one, in a state that banned such marriages for decades. The couple, however, remains unshaken by this fact. “We see hearts, we don't see color,” they say. While Hill and Harrison are thrilled to have found each other, their marriage has instigated a court battle over Hill's estate, which could end up separating the couple. The issue revolves around Hill being legally incapacitated. A judge ruled that her daughter, Rebecca Wright, should not have facilitated the marriage without the court's permission in light of her mother's condition. Wright's sister, Patricia Barber, claims the union complicates the division of Hill's 475,000 estate because now, Harrison could inherit a portion. Barber's intentions have been a point of debate, with Wright telling WUSA9, \\"She wants to sell my mother's house. She wants the money.\\" The stakes are high for the couple: if Barber wins the case, Hill may either have to move in with Barber or be placed in a nursing home, leading to her separation from Harrison. Despite this, the defiant couple declared, \\"They're not gonna separate us. No, we're not gonna let them.\\" Fortunately, the judge appears to agree with Hill and Harrison, ruling that separating them could \\"create a circumstance in Ms. Hill's life that she doesn't deserve.\\" To safeguard Hill's interests, an attorney has been appointed, and her daughters have been removed as guardians. Wright believes that ageism and racism also play a role in her sister's court action, telling WJLA that mindsets haven't changed despite Virginia lifting its ban on interracial marriages. However, Hill and Harrison remain focused on the love they share, which transcends the barriers of age and race. This remarkable story is a testament to how love can flourish despite external factors, such as age and societal prejudices. As this court battle unfolds, supporters of Hill and Harrison hope that their love and commitment to one another will prevail, allowing them to continue living their lives together, unencumbered by the ghosts of old biases and legal disputes."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

Having been tried and found guilty of murder, Nero has now been hanged and his body taken for the ignominious process of public dissection. The year after the prints were issued, the Murder Act 1752 would ensure that the bodies of murderers could be delivered to the surgeons so they could be \\"dissected and anatomised\\". It was hoped this further punishment on the body and denial of burial would act as a deterrent. At the time Hogarth made the engravings, this right was not enshrined in law, but the surgeons still removed bodies when they could.A tattoo on his arm identifies Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown to have as much feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one of its kind in the first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate. While the surgeons working on the body are observed by the mortar-boarded academics in the front row, the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves. The president has been identified as John Freke, president of the Royal College of Surgeons at the time. Freke had been involved in the high-profile attempt to secure the body of condemned rioter Bosavern Penlez for dissection in 1749. Aside from the over-enthusiastic dissection of the body and the boiling of the bones in situ, the image portrays the procedure as it would have been carried out.Two skeletons to the rear left and right of the print are labelled as James Field, a well-known boxer who...

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which camper learned less about kinetic energy? Answer:","output":"Dan learned less about kinetic energy. Explanation: Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. When Pete heated the unopened can of soup, the heat caused the molecules within the soup and the air inside the can to move faster, increasing their kinetic energy. As kinetic energy increased and the pressure built up inside the sealed can, it eventually led to the explosion. On the other hand, Dan opened his can and heated it over the fire without any problems, which didn't provide him an opportunity to learn about kinetic energy through a similar experience. Since Pete experienced an explosion caused by the increase in kinetic energy of the soup and air molecules inside the sealed can, he inadvertently learned more about kinetic energy than Dan."},{"instruction":"Write a question about the following article.

However, this would result in a contradiction, as it is not possible for Hanson to have seen Sather Karf both with Sersa Garm and on his own simultaneously. B) It is not possible to tell: This option suggests that there isn't enough information provided to determine if the hypothesis is true based on the premise. However, with the information given in the premise, it's clear that Sather Karf was not on his own. C) No: This option asserts that if the premise is true (Hanson saw Sather Karf and Sersa Garm together), then the hypothesis is not true (Hanson saw Sather Karf on his own). This is because Sather Karf was seen together with Sersa Garm and other warlocks, which contradicts the idea that he was on his own. Therefore, the correct answer is option C (no). If the premise is true, then it is not possible for the hypothesis to be true as well, since Sather Karf was seen with Sersa Garm as well as other warlocks outside, not on his own."},{"instruction":"If E ating and drinking in a new part of the world can be a pleasurable adventure., can we conclude that \\"It can be enjoyable to experience food and drink in a new place.\\"?","output":"Yes, it is quite reasonable to conclude that \\"It can be enjoyable to experience food and drink in a new place\\" based on the statement that \\"Eating and drinking in a new part of the world can be a pleasurable adventure.\\" This is primarily because both sentences express the notion that trying new food and drink can bring pleasure and enjoyment to individuals, particularly when they experience these in unfamiliar settings. Travelling to a new part of the world can introduce people to an array of distinct food and drink options, many of which directly reflect the region's culture, climate, and local resources. By sampling local culinary specialties, individuals are granted intimate glimpses into these aspects of a region, which can foster personal growth and enrich one's understanding of the world around them. The concept of pleasure can be derived from both the sensory experience of tasting new cuisine or flavors as well as engaging in the exploration of different food cultures. In addition to this, the introduction of unique food combinations and textures greatly contributes to the overall joy that one may derive from experiencing culinary delights in a new locale. Furthermore, shared dining experiences can also play a significant role in creating memorable moments while travelling. People can forge lasting connections with others through engaging in communal meals and partaking in food-centered customs in various cultural contexts. Such interactions can lead to heightened senses of enjoyment while embellishing travellers' insights into the lives and traditions of the people they encounter. Lastly, the adventurous aspect of discovering and sampling new food and drinks also caters to individuals' innate desire for novelty and learning. This adventurousness can bring about a sense of excitement, which in turn bolsters the pleasurable aspects of the situation, elevating it from a mere meal to a truly remarkable experience. Undeniably, various factors work in concert to make the act of exploring food and drink in new and unfamiliar places a uniquely satisfying pursuit. In conclusion, the statement \\"Eating and drinking in a new part of the world can be a pleasurable adventure\\" implies that the enjoyment stems from a combination of sensory experiences, cultural exploration, forging social connections, and the inherent excitement of trying new things. Therefore, it can be aptly concluded that \\"It can be enjoyable to experience food and drink in a new place.\\""},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given an input list.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What can overexposure to vibrating matter cause?\\" with the following options: - symptoms - hypothyroidism - Pollution - hyperthyroidism - Damaged hearing - Electrical energy - Relieve pain - decrease stamina The answer is:","output":"Damaged hearing To understand why damaged hearing is the correct answer, it's essential to consider the given facts and analyze the relationship between them. Fact 1: Matter vibrating can cause sound. Fact 2: Overexposure to sound can damage hearing. Fact 1 explains that vibrations in matter, such as air, solid objects, or water, can create sound. These vibrations produce pressure waves, which our ears detect and interpret as sound. In everyday life, we encounter sounds generated by vibrating matter, such as machinery, music, or other people's voices. Fact 2 reveals that overexposure to sound, specifically loud and repetitive or continuous noises, can lead to hearing damage. When the sound waves are too intense, they can cause harm to the tiny hair cells in the inner ear, which are responsible for transmitting sound signals to the brain. Once these hair cells are damaged, they're not able to regenerate, leading to permanent hearing loss. This is known as noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Furthermore, overexposure to loud sounds over time can result in tinnitus, a constant ringing or buzzing in the ears. By combining these two facts, we can infer that overexposure to vibrating matter can lead to damaged hearing. This is because the vibrations from the matter give rise to sound, and if that sound is too loud or repetitive for an extended period, it may result in hearing damage, as mentioned in Fact 2. The other options listed – symptoms, hypothyroidism, pollution, hyperthyroidism, electrical energy, relieve pain, and decrease stamina – are not directly related to the given facts and may not accurately answer the question at hand."},{"instruction":"Prince Vijaya and his 700 followers left Supparaka, landed on the island at a site believed to be in the district of Chilaw, near modern-day Mannar, and founded the Kingdom of Tambapanni. It is recorded the Vijaya made his landing on the day of Buddha's death. Vijaya claimed Tambapanni his capital and soon the whole island come under this name. Tambapanni was originally inhabited and governed by Yakkhas, having their capital at Sirisavatthu and their queen Kuveni. According to the Samyutta Commentary, Tambapanni was one hundred leagues in extent. After landing in Tambapanni Vijaya met Kuveni the queen of the Yakkhas, who was disguised as a beautiful woman but was really a 'yakkini' (devil) named Sesapathi. At the end of his reign, Vijaya, having trouble choosing a successor, sent a letter to the city of his ancestors, Sinhapura, in order to invite his brother Sumitta to take over the throne. However, Vijaya had died before the letter had reached its destination, so the elected minister of the people Upatissa, the Chief government minister or prime minister and leading chief among the Sinhalese became regent and acted as regent for a year. After his coronation, which was held in the Kingdom of Tambapanni, he left it, building another one, bearing his own name. While he was king, Upatissa established the new capital Upatissa, in which the kingdom was moved to from the Kingdom of Tambapanni. When Vijaya's letter arrived, Sumitta had already succeeded his father as king of his country, and so he sent his son Panduvasdeva to rule Upatissa Nuwara. Upatissa Nuwara was seven or eight miles further north of the Kingdom of Tambapanni.

The author seems to express strong dissatisfaction and frustration towards the movie in question. Several factors contribute to this perception: 1. Choice of words: The author uses a set of harsh words and strong expressions - \\"bang your head on the seat in front of you\\", \\"cluelessness\\", \\"idiocy\\", and \\"utterly misplaced earnestness\\". This vocabulary underscores the level of discontent and irritation felt by the author. 2. Imagery: The action of \\"banging your head on the seat in front of you\\" is a vivid and extreme image. It suggests a sense of wanting to escape the movie theater or show dissatisfaction with the movie. This image accentuates the negative sentiment, as the author compares the discomfort and frustration experienced during the movie to self-inflicting pain. 3. Emphasis on the scope of negative qualities: The author does not limit their criticism to just one aspect of the movie. Instead, they mention multiple negative qualities, such as cluelessness, idiocy, and misplaced earnestness. This suggests that the author perceives a whole range of issues with the movie, which contributes to an overall negative sentiment. 4. Use of hyperbole: The phrase \\"utterly misplaced earnestness\\" suggests that the author thinks that any attempt to take the movie's content seriously is entirely misguided. This exaggeration intensifies the negative sentiment and casts the movie in an even more unfavorable light. In conclusion, the sentiment of this sentence is perceived as extremely negative and critical due to the choice of words, imagery, emphasis on the range of negative qualities, and the use of hyperbole. The author communicates a strong sense of dissatisfaction, irritation, and frustration, effectively conveying their negative view of the movie."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Process: - Acid rain makes waters acidic - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die - The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems - Question: suppose there will be more remains buried happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The scenario described involves an increase in the number of remains being buried, and the question being asked is how this perturbation influences the second effect mentioned (the absorption of aluminum by waters due to acid rain) and whether it will have more, less, or no effect. First, let's discuss the overall process of acid rain and its impact on ecosystems. Acid rain occurs when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the atmosphere, primarily as a result of human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels. These chemicals react with water, oxygen, and other substances in the air to form sulfuric and nitric acids. These acidic compounds then fall back to the Earth's surface as rain, snow, fog, or dry deposition. Acid rain damages ecosystems, infrastructure, and human health. When acid rain makes waters acidic, it forces these natural aquatic systems to absorb aluminum from the surrounding soil, which can be toxic to aquatic life. This results in a chain reaction of events that negatively impacts the entire ecosystem. As fish, frogs, plants, insects, and other wildlife die, the overall health of the ecosystem deteriorates, leading to further problems. Now, let's assess the impact of the increased number of remains being buried on the absorption of aluminum due to acid rain. Remains, whether human or animal, are typically composed of organic matter. As they decompose, they release nutrients and minerals into the soil. One possibility is that the remains might release additional minerals and elements into the soil that could neutralize or counteract the acidic effects of acid rain. Nevertheless, the specifics of this would depend on the chemical composition of the remains, as well as the geological features of the burial location. In the context of the scenario presented, the increase in the number of remains being buried is likely to have one of the following effects on the absorption of aluminum by waters due to acid rain: 1. More effect: The decomposition of a larger number of buried remains could potentially release substances that exacerbate the impact of acid rain, further increasing the acidity of the waters and causing them to absorb even more aluminum from the soil. This could exacerbate problems in the ecosystem. 2. Less effect: If the decomposition of the remains releases minerals or elements that can neutralize or counteract the acidic effects of acid rain, then there could be a reduced risk of aluminum absorption by the waters. However, this would very much depend on the specific chemical composition of the remains and the surrounding environment. 3. No effect: In cases where the decomposition of the remains does not release substances that either exacerbate or neutralize the impact of acid rain, the increase in the number of remains being buried would not directly affect the absorption of aluminum by waters due to acid rain. Based on available information, it is challenging to definitively state whether the increased number of remains being buried will have more, less, or no effect on the absorption of aluminum by waters due to acid rain. The answer would be highly dependent on the specific circumstances, such as the chemical composition of the buried remains and the geological features of the burial site. Further research would be needed to better understand the potential interactions and identify potential solutions to mitigate the impacts of acid rain on ecosystems."},{"instruction":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"positive\\" sentiment (Choices: - negative. - positive.).","output":"This movie was really positive and super fun!

I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo.

Topical corticosteroid products, including those available over-the-counter, should not be applied to your breast area without first consulting your physician. Psoriasis outbreaks occur anywhere on the body, including the breast tissue. Psoriasis patches appear as thick, silvery, sometimes reddened patches, that are itchy and often painful. If you develop a psoriasis outbreak on your breast area, contact your doctor before you apply any medication. Be sure your doctor intends for you to apply medications you may already have on your breast tissue. Breast eczema outbreaks most often occur in the area of the nipple. The area often appears as an itchy, reddened area, and is sometimes accompanied by crusty formations and drainage from the sores. Due to the similarity in the rash associated with breast eczema and a more serious condition, Paget's disease, a medical examination is warranted. Take care to keep the area dry, and avoid harsh soaps or perfumed products. In addition to topical products, your doctor may prescribe oral medications to help treat any infection that may have started, as well as medications that can help control the itching. Topical products that may be prescribed include corticosteroids that reduce inflammation and promote healing, as well as newer agents, called calcineurin inhibitors. The newer agents are only used in people with severe and repeated flare-ups of eczema. Examples of the newer agents include tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. These agents help your skin to heal, and prevent further flares of eczema or atopic dermatitis. These medications alter the way your immune system works. With outbreaks of both psoriasis and eczema, regardless of where they form on your skin, scratching the areas can lead to complications. Scratching can cause the condition to spread beyond the immediate area, can cause further skin irritation, and possibly lead to infection. Many people scratch at night without realizing it. Try putting band-aids over your fingertips when you sleep, or sleep with socks over your hands to help avoid scratching.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of seeking a medical professional's advice when dealing with breast eczema or psoriasis outbreaks on the breast.

Article:","output":"Title: Long-Acting Birth Control for Teens + Condoms = Healthy Choices Hey kids! Today, we are going to talk about something that is very important for teenagers to know. Do you know what birth control is? Well, it's a way for people to make sure they don't have a baby when they're not ready for it yet. There are many kinds of birth control, and some work for a long time. One long-lasting kind of birth control is called an IUD (which stands for Intra-Uterine Device) or a hormonal implant. These are tiny things that the doctor puts inside a girl's body, and they can help keep her from getting pregnant for a long time! But, there's something else we need to think about, and that's STIs (which stands for Sexually Transmitted Infections). These are infections that people can get if they are close to someone in a special way. They can make you feel sick, and sometimes can cause serious health problems. Guess what? The American Academy of Pediatrics, which is a group of doctors who know a lot about children's health, says that teenagers should use another kind of birth control called condoms every time they have sex. Condoms are like rubber balloons that are worn over a boy's private part during a special hug, and they can help protect both boys and girls from getting those yucky infections. So, remember, using both long-acting birth control like IUDs or hormonal implants and wearing condoms is a great way for teenagers to make healthy choices for their bodies. It's important to stay safe and protected when we grow up and start making big decisions about our lives. And always, be sure to talk to a trusted grown-up like your parents or a doctor if you have questions!"},{"instruction":"I saw this film at its premier at Sundance 09. Since American Beauty is a movie that had something to say, I had hopes for Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, of countless movies I've seen in almost a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I've ever wanted to walk out early from. The worst problem with Towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of \\"provocative\\" concepts concerning cultural stereotypes, rather than with an organic human drama. The screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian. The famous Edith Wharton quote comes to mind: I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author's political views. That observation is especially devastating for Towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic. If there ever was a time when Towelhead's white male villains, condescending portrayals of blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., were fresh, it's long past. For a more detailed review, please look up any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on. On the other hand, the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled. As you read through the reviews in this and similar sites, you'll frequently come across superlatives: \\"stunning,\\" \\"breathtaking,\\" \\"profound,\\" \\"shocking,\\" ... It embarrasses me to read them, but it does not surprise me. Indeed, I've encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial, cultural, gender, or sexual issues as deeply moving, thought provoking, full of profound insight. If you are such a person, by all means, rent Towelhead and be moved by it. On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can safely pass on this one.

More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.\\", answer the following question.

Throughout his career, Longwell has brought an undeniable value to the teams he has played for, thanks to his consistency and accuracy in kicking field goals. Analyzing his field goal yards is an effective way to appreciate his contributions to the league. In this article, we delve into the career details of Ryan Longwell, his field goal statistics, and a comprehensive look at the total number of field goal yards he accrued over his NFL tenure. Ryan Longwell's NFL Career and Teams Ryan Longwell's NFL career spanned 15 years, making him one of the most accomplished and consistent kickers in the league's history. He joined the NFL by signing with the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent in 1997, but he started his playing career with the Green Bay Packers in the same year after being waived by the 49ers. Longwell's association with the Packers lasted from 1997 to 2005, followed by joining the Minnesota Vikings (2006-2011) and later, a one-year stint with the Seattle Seahawks in 2012 before retiring. Throughout this long and illustrious career, Longwell marvelously tallied numerous field goals, earning respect and admiration from his teammates, coaches, and fans alike. Career Stats and Field Goal Yard Breakdown From his debut in 1997 until his retirement from the NFL in 2012, Ryan Longwell scored a total of 361 field goals. When evaluating his total field goal yards, it is essential to consider individual distances and the number of successful attempts for each range. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of Ryan Longwell's successful field goal attempts: 1. Field Goals from 0-19 yards: 3. 2. Field Goals from 20-29 yards: 66. 3. Field Goals from 30-39 yards: 117. 4. Field Goals from 40-49 yards: 132. 5. Field Goals from 50+ yards: 43. To calculate the total number of field goal yards, we can multiply the number of successful attempts by the mid-point of each yardage range and add them all together: 1. 0-19 yards: 3 x 10 = 30 yards. 2. 20-29 yards: 66 x 25 = 1,650 yards. 3. 30-39 yards: 117 x 35 = 4,095 yards. 4. 40-49 yards: 132 x 45 = 5,940 yards. 5. 50+ yards: Assuming an average of 52 yards for practicality, 43 x 52 = 2,236 yards. Total Field Goal Yards To find out the total field goal yards, we add the values we got from the individual ranges: 30 + 1,650 + 4,095 + 5,940 + 2,236 = 13,951 yards This calculation suggests that Ryan Longwell had a total of 13,951 field goal yards during his fifteen years of playing in the NFL. Conclusion Ryan Longwell's kicking career has truly been impressive, with 13,951 field goal yards scored throughout his tenure in the NFL. His strong performance record has made him a household name among football fans and enthusiasts, etching his place in the league's history books. As one of the most revered kickers in the NFL, Longwell's career numbers remind us of his consistent execution and unwavering dedication to his craft. While tallying his field goal yards is a quantitative look at his career, it does serve as an accurate representation of of his contributions to the league."},{"instruction":"Write a summary based on this article: A source familiar with the investigation confirms that skeletal remains were found at a dig site in southeast Houston. (Photo: Air 11) HOUSTON – Authorities have dug up human skeletal remains in a field where they’ve been searching for a teenage girl who went missing for nearly 20 years. The medical examiner’s office is investigating whether the remains belong to Jessica Cain, who went missing from Texas City in 1997. “If it’s not Jessica Cain, then we have to find out who it is,” said Houston Homicide Detective Richard Martinez. “There’s enough there to know that it’s a body, so they still have to keep digging and meticulously get every bone they can. The remains were found around 2:30 Friday afternoon when a backhoe operator found what he thought were skeletal remains, according to detectives. Those suspicions were confirmed after an anthropologist conducted an investigation. Martinez said the remains were found about four feet in the ground to find the remains. “We don’t know what the conditions of the field were back in 1997,” he said. Crews have been digging in the field for more than three weeks after convict William Reece tipped them off that Cain’s remains could be found in the field. Reece, who’s serving time for aggravated kidnapping, has been linked to at least five murders or kidnappings—all from 1997. The Houston Police Department is the lead agency in the investigation. Investigators said they’ll work in conjunction with other departments, such as the Friendswood Police Department, if, in fact, they are Cain's remains.

It all depends on the forensics, Houston police said Friday as searchers continued carefully excavating a scrubby horse pasture along East Orem near Hobby Airport. \\"Right now, we have no clue who this person is,\\" said Richard Martinez, a detective with the Houston Police Department's homicide division. Harris County medical examiners will analyze the remains, police said, and should be able to say if they are that of Jessica Cain, 17, who vanished without a trace on Aug. 17, 1997, while driving home after a high school musical cast party at a restaurant in Clear Lake. Only her truck, with her purse locked inside, was ever found, on the shoulder of Interstate 45 on the route to her Tiki Island home. But, Martinez said, the spot where the remains were discovered is \\"basically the same area\\" where convicted kidnapper William Lewis Reece, 54, was recently seen in the company of law enforcement officers. After weeks of searching the field, about 2:30 p.m. Friday a backhoe operator at the site signaled the discovery of the apparent remains. An anthropologist and other analysts with the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences were called to the scene. \\"Right now, they're in the process of recovering those remains,\\" Martinez said. \\"There is enough there to know that it's a body.\\" He said the remains were found at least four feet below the surface. Heavy thunderstorms blew through the area while investigators continued the excavation. \\"If it rains too hard and fills up with water, you have to let it subside and then start over,\\" Martinez said. The cause of death and the identity won't be known until after a forensics examination. Martinez said there appeared to be enough to make a DNA confirmation. \\"If it is not Jessica Cain, we have to find out who it is,\\" he said. The investigation will become a Houston police case regardless of the identity because the remains were discovered within their jurisdiction. But Martinez said the department will work with other law enforcement agencies if it does turn out to be Jessica Cain. Police said Reece was not at the site on Friday. He was serving a 60-year prison sentence for a 1998 aggravated kidnapping when police in mid-February brought him in shackles to Galveston County for interviews. Since then, Reece had been seen pacing the pasture, seeming to point out the spots where the searchers should focus. He also is identified by police as the prime suspect in the August 1997 kidnapping and murder of 12-year-old Laura Smither, who vanished from her Friendswood neighborhood while jogging. Houston police could not estimate how long it would take for medical examiners to determine the identity of the skeletal remains. Chronicle reporter St. John Barned-Smith contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"Human skeletal remains have been discovered in a field in southeast Houston, where authorities have been searching for teenage girl Jessica Cain, who went missing nearly 20 years ago. The remains were found on Friday afternoon by a backhoe operator and were identified as human after an anthropologist conducted an investigation. The medical examiner's office is now investigating if the remains belong to Jessica Cain, who went missing from Texas City in 1997. The primary suspect in Jessica Cain's disappearance, William Reece, who has been linked to at least five murders or kidnappings from 1997, tipped off the authorities about the location of the remains."},{"instruction":"Answer the question...when's the last time we had solar eclipse??","output":"To accurately answer this question, I would need to access the internet which I'm unable to do so now due to my limitations.

She becomes enraptured by its beauty and power, not knowing that the story behind the violin is rooted in deceit and betrayal. Unbeknownst to Anne, Neal's success in the antique violin business comes from years of highly skilled forgery, where he replicates coveted historical violins and sells them as legitimate artifacts. \\"The Pearl of Vienna\\" is no exception. Its acquisition had resulted in a double-cross, a broken partnership, and even a suicide. As the big concert night approaches, Anne feels an eerie sense of attachment to the violin.

The setting is a bustling, high-tech city with a dark underworld in the near future. Step 2: Introduce the core conflict Unknown to the members of DTO, Chris is working undercover on behalf of a secret government agency to dismantle the organization from within. His mission is to gather evidence, identify the key players, and learn the group's plans for their next big heist. Step 3: Chris's success with the group Despite the challenges and risks involved, Chris manages to gain the trust of other DTO members. He successfully participates in their smaller heists and training sessions, which further solidifies his position within their ranks. Step 4: Introduction of other members and rising suspicions As Chris gets closer to the DTO members, particularly the charismatic and mysterious leader, Archer Steele, some of the other members, especially the sharp-eyed and impulsive Katya and the devious mastermind Lucas, begin to suspect that Chris might not be the loyal new member they initially believed him to be. Step 5: Planning the next big heist However, Chris's dedication to the cause and his exceptional skills have convinced Archer to include him in the planning for their next heist, which involves stealing a highly secured artifact from the National Museum. This artifact is rumored to have the power to unlock some of the world's greatest treasures and secrets. Step 6: The ambush and Chris's capture While working on the planning and strategizing the next heist, Katya and Lucas plan a subtle ambush to test Chris's loyalty. A night before the heist, Chris is suddenly attacked and knocked out during a routine meeting by the other DTO members, who have been waiting for proof of his betrayal. Step 7: The revelation and escape With Chris captured and tied up, Katya and Lucas present evidence of his true identity as an undercover agent to Archer. Despite the betrayal, Archer offers Chris a final chance to prove his loyalty by participating in the theft of the artifact. Chris pretends to accept the offer and, at the right moment, manages to break free of his restraints and makes a daring escape. Step 8: Climactic fight and conclusion As Chris tries to rush the gathered evidence to his superiors, the DTO members pursue him through the city. A fierce battle ensues between Chris and the other DTO members. The fight ends with Chris ultimately emerging victorious and bringing Archer Steele into custody. Lucas and Katya, however, manage to evade capture, leaving the possibility for a sequel. Step 9: Resolution With Archer Steele in custody and the DTO's plans exposed, Chris's mission is deemed a success. However, the power and influence of the DTO still prove to be a lingering threat as the remaining members are still at large.

Not one car pulled off the interstate all morning. Nothing hit the drive but a thin steady rain, puddling slow rainbows in the oil. Me and Harnie just tilted back our chairs against the cigarette rack, watched the monster movie, and waited for the game to start. The big flying turtle was about set to barbeque downtown Tokyo when the drive bell rang, and up sluiced a car so damn gorgeous it hurt to look at it. A '37 Buick Roadmaster it was, painted a red so rich it was nearly black, that straight eight engine whispering like a lover while teardrops of rain rolled down the chrome grill. Out climbed this tall fellow, dressed like God's grandpa done up for a wedding or a funeral. His skin was brown as a buckwheat cake, with creases deep as drainage ditches.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \\"treatise on a place\\", or fangzhi, replaced the old \\"map guide\\", or tujing, during the Song dynasty.The imperial courts of the emperor's palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north.

Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking) and for reasons of style and fashion. - Mount Vesuvius ( also \\"Vesevus\\" or \\"Vesaevus\\" in some Roman sources) is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about east of Naples and a short distance from the shore.

The society may or may not attempt to conceal its existence. The term usually excludes covert groups, such as intelligence agencies or guerrilla insurgencies, that hide their activities and memberships but maintain a public presence. The exact qualifications for labeling a group a secret society are disputed, but definitions generally rely on the degree to which the organization insists on secrecy, and might involve the retention and transmission of secret knowledge, the denial of membership or knowledge of the group, the creation of personal bonds between members of the organization, and the use of secret rites or rituals which solidify members of the group. - Naples (Neapolitan: \\"Napule\\" or ; meaning \\"new city\\") is the capital of the Italian region Campania and the third-largest municipality in Italy, after Rome and Milan.

It opens to the west into the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered on the north by the cities of Naples and Pozzuoli, on the east by Mount Vesuvius, and on the south by the Sorrentine Peninsula and the main town of the peninsula, Sorrento. The Peninsula separates the Gulf of Naples from the Gulf of Salerno, which includes the Amalfi coast. - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant.

The Campanian volcanic arc centers on the bay of Naples and includes: \\"Campanian volcanic arc\\" is somewhat a term of convenience, since the area is part of the same large area of intense volcanic and seismic activity that includes, further to the south, the active island volcanoes of Stromboli, and Vulcano off the north coast of Sicily and even the largest active volcano in Europe, Mt. Etna, on Sicily itself. - The Camorra is an Italian Mafia-type crime syndicate, or secret society, which arose in the region of Campania and its capital Naples. It is one of the oldest and largest criminal organizations in Italy, dating back to the 16th century. Unlike the pyramidal structure of the Sicilian Mafia, the Camorra's organizational structure is more horizontal than vertical. Consequently, individual Camorra clans act independently of each other, and are more prone to feuding among themselves. - The Sicilian Mafia, also known as simply the Mafia or Cosa Nostra (\\"Our thing\\"), is a criminal syndicate in Sicily, Italy. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share a common organisational structure and code of conduct. The basic group is known as a \\"family\\", \\"clan\\", or \\"\\"cosca\\"\\" or \\"cosche\\" in Sicilian. Each family claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village or a neighbourhood (\\"borgata\\") of a larger city, in which it operates its rackets. Its members call themselves \\"men of honour\\", although the public often refers to them as \\"mafiosi\\". The mafia's core activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. - A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland. - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as . - MILAN (\\"milan(e)\\" is French for kite) is a European anti-tank guided missile. Design of the MILAN started in 1962, it was ready for trials in 1971, and was accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire guided SACLOS (semi-automatic command to line-of-sight) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit has to be aimed at the target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans .

Options: - kept at accountant - purse - desk drawer - bank - keeping track of expenses Explain why a human would choose \\"desk drawer\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human would choose \\"desk drawer\\" as the most appropriate option for storing an account book when leaving and not needing to bring it along, for several reasons: 1. Accessibility: Placing the account book in a desk drawer ensures that it is easily accessible whenever needed. Desk drawers are usually located where the person works and are readily available when they need to consult or update the account book. This allows for efficient management of the information contained in the book. 2. Organization: Keeping the account book in a desk drawer helps keep a person's workspace organized. Desk drawers typically contain necessary office supplies, stationery, and other work-related items. Storing the account book in a designated location like a desk drawer allows for a systematic approach to managing financial records, making it easier to locate the book when needed. 3. Security: A desk drawer provides a certain degree of security for the account book. While it may not be as secure as a locked safe, it does offer some protection against theft, loss, or unauthorized access. Additionally, the account book can be placed in a locked drawer for added security, if required. 4. Confidentiality: Financial information, such as what is contained in an account book, can be sensitive and confidential. Storing the book in a desk drawer gives the individual a level of privacy, protecting the information from being unintentionally seen by visitors, coworkers, or other unauthorized individuals. 5. Prevention of Damage: A desk drawer also helps protect the account book from any potential damage. Storing it in a secure location, away from potential spills, direct sunlight, or other hazards minimizes the risk of accidental harm befalling the book, thus maintaining its condition and preserving the information it contains. On the other hand, the alternatives mentioned do not suit the requirements: - \\"Kept at accountant\\" implies that a professional would manage the account book on behalf of the individual, which may not be necessary since they do not need to access the book when leaving. This option may be excessive and expensive for personal finances. - \\"Purse\\" is not an appropriate storage option since it would be with the person when leaving, which contradicts the initial requirement of not needing to bring it along. - \\"Bank\\" is not a suitable option since banks typically do not hold personal documents like account books. They focus on providing financial services and safeguarding financial assets like money, bonds, and other valuable items in secure boxes, rather than physical books. - \\"Keeping track of expenses\\" is not a specific storage location but a purpose for using the account book. Therefore, it does not answer the question. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"desk drawer\\" to store an account book when leaving without needing to bring it, as it provides accessibility, organization, security, confidentiality, and protection from potential damage. It is an effective storage solution that meets the person's needs while not being excessively burdensome or costly."},{"instruction":"Amy Winehouse was born in Chase Farm Hospital, in north London, to Jewish parents.

And at the center of it all, President Donald Trump. “Can we do one question at a time? Wait! One question at a time,\\" the president scolded reporters. Trump launched a new attack on the Russia probe in the wake of a critical report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Justice. “I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy. It was critical of the man Trump fired as FBI director, James Comey, but rejected the notion of a politically-directed effort aimed at Trump. “This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review,\\" announced current FBI Director Christopher Wray. Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization. Nobody wants to report that. I got along with him great. We have a great chemistry together. That is a good thing, not a bad thing.\\" Trump also lashed out at opposition Democrats and tried to blame them for recent administration actions to separate family members caught trying to come across the U.S. border. “The Democrats forced that law upon our nation.

OAKLAND, California (CNN) -- A former police officer for the Bay Area transit system pleaded not guilty Thursday in the New Year's Day shooting of a passenger at an Oakland rail station. Former transit officer Johannes Mehserle is charged with homicide in the death of Oscar Grant III. Johannes Mehserle, 27, appeared in a packed Alameda County courtroom, with his supporters separated by a courtroom aisle from relatives of shooting victim Oscar Grant III and other spectators. Mehserle is charged with shooting Grant, 22, in an incident that spurred violent protests in Oakland after being captured on video. Mehserle resigned his job as a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer days after the shooting, and he was arrested in Nevada earlier this week. Thursday's proceedings took less than five minutes, with Mehserle appearing behind heavy windows in an enclosure out of view of all but a handful of spectators. BART police had been called to","output":"the Fruitvale Station on New Year's Day in response to reports of a fight involving several passengers on a train. Grainy cell phone videos taken by bystanders showed officers, including Mehserle, detaining a group of young men, including Grant, on the station platform. During the altercation, Grant, who was unarmed, was forced to the ground. While Grant was face-down on the platform, Mehserle pulled his service weapon and fired a single shot into Grant's back, which ultimately proved fatal. The case drew nationwide attention after the videos went viral, sparking public outrage and a series of protests and riots in Oakland. Critics accused the police of racial bias and excessive force, as Grant was African American, and Mehserle is white. Some protesters compared the shooting to the high-profile cases of police violence against unarmed black men in other cities across the United States. In the months that followed, the Alameda County District Attorney's Office sought to have Mehserle tried for murder, but the jury ultimately found him guilty of involuntary manslaughter, a lesser charge. They also found that Mehserle had used a gun in the commission of a crime. The trial, which had been moved to Los Angeles due to concerns about finding an impartial jury in Alameda County, ended with Mehserle receiving a two-year prison sentence. He was released on parole in 2011 after serving 11 months. Grant’s family and supporters expressed disappointment and frustration with what they saw as a lenient sentence for Mehserle. They argued that the judicial system had failed to hold the former police officer fully accountable for his actions and demanded reforms to address police brutality, racial profiling, and the use of excessive force. In the years since the verdict, Grant's death has remained a rallying point for civil rights activists, who continue to seek justice and change on a broader scale. The shooting and its aftermath have also led to policy changes within the BART police force. These changes include enhanced training in non-lethal force techniques, the use of body cameras by officers, and the creation of an independent auditor's office to review complaints against the BART police. While the end of the passage marks the conclusion of the criminal trial, it's clear that the consequences and discussions triggered by the shooting of Oscar Grant III continue to influence policing practices and public discourse on racial injustice today."},{"instruction":"Generate a short movie review that has positive sentiment.","output":"Step 1: Choose a movie I will choose the movie \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" because it is a widely acclaimed film with strong positive sentiment among audiences.

Buchanan was a senior advisor to U.S. Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan, and was an original host on CNN's Crossfire. He sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1992 and 1996. He ran on the Reform Party ticket in the 2000 presidential election. Context: Buchanan wrote that it was impossible for 850,000 Jews to be killed by diesel exhaust fed into the gas chamber at Treblinka in a column for the New York Post in 1990. Buchanan once argued Treblinka \\"was not a death camp but a transit camp used as a 'pass-through point' for prisoners\\". In fact, some 900,000 Jews had died at Treblinka. When George Will challenged him about it on TV, Buchanan did not reply. In 1991 William F. Buckley, Jr. wrote a 40,000-word National Review article discussing anti-Semitism among conservative commentators focused largely on Buchanan; the article and many responses to it were collected in the book In Search of Anti-Semitism (1992). He concluded: \\"I find it impossible to defend Pat Buchanan against the charge that what he did and said during the period under examination amounted to anti-Semitism.\\" The Anti-Defamation League has called Buchanan an \\"unrepentant bigot\\" who \\"repeatedly demonizes Jews and minorities and openly affiliates with white supremacists.\\" \\"There's no doubt,\\" said Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Charles Krauthammer, \\"he makes subliminal appeals to prejudice.\\" Buchanan denies that he is antisemitic, and a number of his journalistic colleagues, including Murray Rothbard, Justin Raimondo, Jack Germond, Al Hunt and Mark Shields, have defended him against the charge. As a member of the Reagan White House, he is accused of having suppressed the Reagan Justice Department's investigation into Nazi scientists brought to America by the OSS's Operation Paperclip. In the context of the Gulf War, on September 15, 1990, Buchanan appeared on The McLaughlin Group and said that \\"there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East - the Israeli defense ministry and its 'amen corner' in the United States.\\" He also said: \\"The Israelis want this war desperately because they want the United States to destroy the Iraqi war machine. They want us to finish them off. They don't care about our relations with the Arab world.\\" Furthermore, on The McLaughlin Group Buchanan has also made such comments as \\"'Capitol Hill is Israeli occupied territory' and 'If you want to know ethnicity and power in the United States Senate, 13 members of the Senate are Jewish folks who are from 2 percent of the population. That is where real power is at...'\\" Buchanan supported President Reagan's plan to visit a German military cemetery at Bitburg in 1985, where among buried Wehrmacht soldiers were the graves of 48 Waffen SS members. At the insistence of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and over the vocal objections of Jewish groups, the trip went through. In an interview, author Elie Wiesel described attending a White House meeting of Jewish leaders about the trip: \\"The only one really defending the trip was Pat Buchanan, saying, 'We cannot give the perception of the President being subjected to Jewish pressure.'\\" Buchanan accused Wiesel of fabricating the story in an ABC interview in 1992: \\"I didn't say it and Elie Wiesel wasn't even in the meeting [...] That meeting was held three weeks before the Bitburg summit was held. If I had said that, it would have been out of there within hours and on the news\\". Question: Did he often deny the holocaust happened? Answer:","output":"Patrick Buchanan has made some controversial statements about the Holocaust, such as questioning the number of deaths at Treblinka and calling it a transit camp rather than a death camp. However, it's not correct to say he \\"often\\" denies the Holocaust happened. Some people have accused him of being anti-Semitic because of his statements, but Buchanan denies that he is anti-Semitic, and some of his colleagues have defended him against the charge."},{"instruction":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Inside the house, the Palladian form reaches a height and grandeur seldom seen in any other house in England.

Work on the interiors ran from 1739 to 1773. The first habitable rooms were in the family wing and were in use from 1740, the Long Library being the first major interior completed in 1741. Among the last to be completed and entirely under Lady Leicester's supervision is the Chapel with its alabaster reredos. The house is entered through the Marble Hall (though the chief building fabric is in fact pink Derbyshire alabaster), modelled by Kent on a Roman basilica. The room is over 50 feet (15 m) from floor to ceiling and is dominated by the broad white marble flight of steps leading to the surrounding gallery, or peristyle: here alabaster Ionic columns support the coffered, gilded ceiling, copied from a design by Inigo Jones, inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. The fluted columns are thought to be replicas of those in the Temple of Fortuna Virilis, also in Rome. Around the hall are statues in niches; these are predominantly plaster copies of classical deities. The hall's flight of steps lead to the piano nobile and state rooms. The grandest, the Saloon, is situated immediately behind the great portico, with its walls lined with patterned red caffoy (a mixture of wool, linen and silk) and a coffered, gilded ceiling. In this room hangs Rubens's Return from Egypt. On his Grand Tour, the Earl acquired a collection of Roman copies of Greek and Roman sculpture which is contained in the extensive Statue Gallery, which runs the full length of the house north to south.

Although nervous at the prospect of leaving Nora behind, they both agree it's an opportunity he cannot miss. Their last night together is bittersweet, filled with laughter but also the pain of separation. Before Francis leaves, Nora hands him a sealed envelope, telling him to only open it once he's boarded the train. He reluctantly agrees, and they exchange tearful goodbyes. On the train, Francis opens the envelope to find a beautiful watercolor portrait of them together, along with two letters - one from Nora, expressing how much she loves him and how she is counting down the days until they are reunited; the second is a short diagnosis from Nora’s doctor that she has a rare and aggressive form of cancer, with little time left.

Drama critic John Earl observes a piece of artwork in a museum, gazing at it reverently. He asks the museum curator how much it costs, and the curator says that it is not for sale. The artist, James Harlan Corbin [Lederer], does not wish to sell the painting. Nonplussed, Earl returns to his office and phones Corbin with his proposal to sell. Again, Corbin refuses. Earl continues his pursuit to find out who the model for the painting was. He learns it is Helen North, a young woman who looks nothing like the woman in the painting. He visits with her to learn his location, but she refuses, telling him that she will be singing at a local nightclub, where Corbin frequents. Earl finds both of them in the museum, and again confronts Corbin. Becoming clearly annoyed, Corbin invites the singer out for a night in his yacht. She agrees, but is later found washed ashore. Although Police Lt. Roberts initially questions Helen's suitor Hunt Mason, Mason implicates Corbin as the last person who saw Helen North. John Earl works with the police department to arrange for Helen's sister Linda to apply for modeling, in order to spy on Corbin. The two return to Corbin's boathouse. While there, Linda calls for Earl and tells his chef that she is in danger and to notify the police. There, she learns that Corbin did not murder her sister.

It was the most senior line of the Capetian dynasty itself a derivative dynasty from the Robertians. Historians in the 19th century came to apply the name \\"Capetian\\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice (see House of France). They were sometimes called \\"the third race of kings\\", the Merovingians being the first, and the Carolingians being the second. The name is derived from the nickname of Hugh, the first Capetian King, who was known as \\"Hugh Capet\\". The direct succession of French kings, father to son, from 987 to 1316, of thirteen generations in almost 330 years, was unparallelled in recorded history. - Troyes is a commune and the capital of the department of Aube in north-central France. It is located on the Seine river about southeast of Paris. This area is known as the Champagne region of Northern France. Many half-timbered houses (mainly of the 16th century) survive in the old town. Troyes has been in existence since the Roman era, as Augustobona Tricassium, which stood at the hub of numerous highways, primarily the Via Agrippa. - The Robertians, or Robertines, was the Frankish predecessor family of origin to the ruling houses of France; it emerged to prominence in the ancient Frankish kingdom of Austrasia as early as the eighth centuryin roughly the same region as present-day Belgiumand later emigrated to West Francia, between the Seine and the Loire rivers. The members were forefathers of the Capetian dynasty. With fealty (sometimes mixed with rancor) to the Carolingians they held the power of West Francia through the whole period of the Carolingian Empire; and from 888 to 987 theirs was the last extant kingdom of that house until they were succeeded by their own (Robertian) lineage, the house of Capet. - The term House of France refers to the members of the Capetian dynasty from which came the Kings of France since the election of Hugh Capet. In retrospect of the monarchy, the Merovingians and Carolingians were encompassed by the House of France by French historians and jurists. The House of France consists of a number of branches and their sub-branches. Some of its branches have acceded to the Crown, while others remained cadets. - The Count of Champagne was the ruler of the region of Champagne from 950 to 1316. Champagne evolved from the county of Troyes in the late eleventh century and Hugh I was the first to officially use the title \\"Count of Champagne\\". - Louis X ( 4 October 1289 -- 5 June 1316 ) , called the Quarreler , the Headstrong , or the Stubborn ( French : le Hutin ) , was a monarch of the House of Capet who ruled as King of Navarre ( as Louis I ) and Count of Champagne from 1305 and as King of France from 1314 until his death . Louis was the eldest son of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre . His short reign as king of France was marked by the hostility of the nobility against fiscal and centralization reforms initiated by Enguerrand de Marigny , the Grand Chamberlain of France , under the reign of his father . Louis ' uncle -- Charles of Valois , leader of the feudalist party -- managed to convince the king to execute Enguerrand de Marigny . Louis allowed serfs to buy their freedom ( which was the first step towards the abolition of serfdom ) , abolished slavery , and readmitted French Jews into the kingdom . In 1305 , Louis had married Margaret of Burgundy , with whom he had Joan II of Navarre . Margaret was later convicted of adultery and strangled in prison . In 1315 , Louis married Clementia of Hungary , who gave birth to John I of France a few months after the king 's death . John 's untimely death led to a disputed succession . - Hugh Capet (c. 941 24 October 996) was the first King of the Franks of the House of Capet from his election in 987 until his death. He succeeded the last Carolingian king, Louis V. - The Capetian dynasty , also known as the House of France, is a dynasty of Frankish origin, founded by Hugh Capet. It is among the largest and oldest European royal houses, consisting of Hugh Capet's male-line descendants. The senior line ruled in France as the House of Capet from the election of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of Charles IV in 1328. They were succeeded by cadet branches, the Houses of Valois and the Bourbon, which ruled until the French Revolution.

How you feel is controlled by many things. Your emotions can be affected by your personality, by the actions of others and by events around you. Perhaps you don't know your emotions can be influenced by the weather as well. People often say they feel good when the sun is shining and sad when it is cloudy. In fact, sunlight makes us feel good. When sunlight hits our skins, our bodies produce a vitamin. Vitamins are natural chemicals which we all need to stay healthy. Sunlight helps our bodies produce vitamin D. Vitamin D helps our bodies make a special chemical. This special chemical affects our brains and makes us feel happy. For example, there are long, dark winters of little sunlight in Sweden and Norway, so many people in these countries often feel sad. Without much sunlight, their bodies produce less vitamin D. Without enough vitamin D, their bodies make less of this special chemical which makes them feel good. To help the people in these countries feel better, special \\"sunrooms\\" with artificial lights have been built. People can go there and get \\"sunlight\\" for an hour or two! The weather can also affect people's emotions in other ways. Hot weather can make people angry because people feel uncomfortable when they are hot. In the same way, rain can make people angry because being wet can be unpleasant. As you can see, the weather can have an effect on the chemicals which control our brains.

So, in summary, when Jim applies more heat to the gas, the gas particles will experience an increase in energy and consequently move at a quicker pace."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of putting dirty plates in the washer after eating and its potential effect on the water purifier would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. To explain further, when dirty plates are placed in the washer, they are introducing food particles, grease, and residues from detergents into the water system. After the washing cycle, the wastewater gets drained, carrying these contaminants with it. Eventually, this water makes its way to the water treatment plant, where it undergoes a series of purification processes before being discharged back into our water sources or distributed for consumption. Although the water filtration system in the plant is designed to combat these contaminants, higher levels of pollutants might demand additional treatment, which could strain the system and affect its efficiency in removing unwanted substances. Indirectly, this could impact the performance of a water purifier, particularly if it's designed to deal with specific levels of contaminants. Although the water purifier's functionality might not be directly affected, an increase in pollutants could potentially reduce its efficacy in providing clean water. It is worth noting that the water purifier in question is specifically designed to handle certain contaminants like chlorine, heavy metals, and other chemicals. The filter may not be designed to deal with the food particles, grease, and residues from detergents commonly found in wastewater from dishwashers.

It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of.

Play music - Remote controls can be used for controlling music devices, such as audio systems or music players. However, this is not their primary purpose. 2. Design software - Remote controls are not typically used for designing software. This is usually done with computers, using software programming tools. 3. Examine things - Remote controls do not have the ability to examine things. Devices such as microscopes and magnifying glasses are used for this purpose. 4. See exhibits - While remote controls can be used in museum settings to interact with exhibits, this is a quite specialized application, and not the primary purpose of a remote control. 5.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process begins with blood filtration in the nephrons, specifically at a structure called the glomerulus. Located in the renal cortex of the kidney, the glomerulus is a network of tiny capillaries surrounded by the Bowman's capsule, which is a cup-like structure. Blood enters the glomerulus through the afferent arteriole, and the high-pressure environment within the glomerulus forces fluid, waste products, and electrolytes out of the blood and across the porous walls of the capillaries. This filtration process comprises water, glucose, ions, amino acids, and urea, while preventing larger elements like blood cells and proteins from passing through. The filtrate, which is a mixture of water and waste products, then collects in the Bowman's capsule and continues to the next step of the process - the renal tubules. Here, the filtrate goes through various processes, such as reabsorption, secretion, and excretion, which eventually lead to the formation of urine. In summary, the first step in the formation of urine is blood filtration, where the glomerulus filters out waste products and excess water from the blood, resulting in the filtrate that later becomes urine."},{"instruction":"En 2004, les produits en vrac exportés par le Canada vers la Pologne ont totalisé un peu plus de 6,4 millions de dollars, ce qui représente une diminution de 13 % par rapport à la valeur de 7,3 millions de dollars enregistrée en 2003, tandis que les exportations de biens intermédiaires ont totalisé 10,6 millions et affiché une légère baisse de 0,5 % par rapport à 2003.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

Hint: As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.

PUBLISHED:. 20:55 EST, 12 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 05:18 EST, 13 February 2013. Reg Turnill, the man who brought the space race to a generation of Britons, has died at the age of 97. As the BBC’s space correspondent from Sputnik through to the shuttle era, Mr Turnill was the voice of extra-planetary exploration for more than 40 years. Described by friends as an ‘astronaut who never made it to the Moon’, he reported on every Nasa Apollo mission, including breaking the story to the world that Apollo 13 was in trouble in 1970. Star: Reg Turnhill, who reported on space exploration from the 1950s until the 1990s, died at the age of 97. He saw the development of modern aviation at first hand, reporting on radio and television from the 1950s until the 1990s – a period which saw a dramatic transformation in the possibilities of space exploration. Later, in semi-retirement, he brought the drama of space to life for schoolchildren on the BBC Newsround programme. Last summer, well into his 90s, he contributed to coverage of death of Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon. Mr Turnill’s eldest son confirmed the news of his father’s death yesterday. Michael Turnill, 72, said his father retained a ‘remarkable’ mind until his death. He had carried on an active role in aerospace journalism was still writing stories just eight weeks ago, he said. Mr Turnill’s career began at the age of 15 as a telephonist for the Press Association in Fleet Street, typing up stories phoned in by reporters. He was promoted to become staff reporter at the news agency and in 1956 was recruited by the BBC as assistant industrial correspondent. Michael Turnill, 72, said his father retained a ¿remarkable¿ mind until his death. In 1958, he was made the BBC’s air and space correspondent, with a brief to cover defence. It was the start of the jet age and he reported on the introduction of passenger flights, including taking a seat on Concorde’s maiden flight in March 1969. But it was his coverage of space exploration which really captured the imagination of his viewers and listeners. He was friends with Wernher von Braun, the architect of Nasa’s moon programme, enabling him to secure interviews with many Apollo astronauts during his career. Mr Turnill later recalled how he became the first to report that the Apollo 13 mission was in trouble. ‘It was 10 o’clock Houston time, 4am London time, and I just looked in to a deserted mission control,’ he said in 2007. ‘All was going well, most journalists had gone to bed. I was just turning to leave the deserted press centre when I heard the famous words: “Houston, we’ve had a problem”. ‘By 5am I’d broken the story. The astronauts were in deadly danger.’ Nick Spall, fellow of the British Interplanetary Society, described Mr Turnill as ‘one of a kind’. He said he had spoken to the correspondent recently and said he was ‘full of his old enthusiasm’. ‘My key memory was of this father figure on TV in the 1960s, explaining it all in a very British way,’ said Mr Spall. He was the astronaut who never made it to the Moon.’ In his later years, he lived in Sandgate, Kent. Mr Turnill passed away peacefully in the early hours yesterday (12th) at the Pilgrim’s Hospice in Ashford, where he had been for the past month. He is survived by his wife Margaret and their two sons. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

During his time with the Miami Dolphins, Bush saw an increased role as a featured running back and had one of the best seasons of his career in 2011. He rushed for 1,086 yards and scored six rushing touchdowns while catching 43 passes for 296 yards and one touchdown. Bush's performance with the Dolphins proved that he could handle the workload of a primary running back in the NFL. In 2012, Reggie Bush continued to play for the Miami Dolphins and had another strong season, rushing for 986 yards and scoring 6 touchdowns while also contributing in the passing game with 35 receptions for 292 yards and two touchdowns. After his stint with the Miami Dolphins, Bush went on to play for the Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers, and the Buffalo Bills before officially retiring from the NFL in 2017. Throughout his career, Reggie Bush was known for his electrifying athleticism, ability to make defenders miss tackles, and contribute in various facets of the game. However, his 2011 season with the Miami Dolphins stands out as one of his most memorable and successful years in the NFL."},{"instruction":"Aubrey brought the chair closer to hear the story.

When Mary was near her, she shouted happily, \\"Mrs Herman! You were my patient last year.\\" \\"Oh, thank you very much, Mary,\\" Mrs Herman said, and stepped forward. \\"No, no, Mrs Herman,\\" Mary said quickly, \\"the light's still red.\\"\\"Oh,\\" Mrs Herman answered as she stepped back. \\"I can easily cross the street alone when the light's green.\\" Question: Why do Mary's patients like her a lot?_. Options: A: Because she is very had B: Because she is serious C: Because she is very kind D: Because she is their aunt The answer is:","output":"C: Because she is very kind The article states that Mary is a nurse at a big hospital and that she is very kind. This is demonstrated by her willingness to assist an old woman, Mrs. Herman, in safely crossing a busy street. In addition, Mrs. Herman recognizes Mary as the nurse who took care of her in the previous year, and she thanks Mary for her help. This shows that Mary's patients appreciate and remember her kindness. Therefore, it can be inferred that Mary's patients like her a lot due to her kind nature, making option C the correct answer. Option A suggests that Mary's patients like her because she is \\"very hard.\\" However, there is no mention of her work ethic or determination in the article; the focus is on her kind demeanor. Option B claims that her patients favor her because she is \\"serious.\\" While being serious can be a valuable trait in a nurse, the article does not mention this aspect of Mary's personality. Instead, it emphasizes her kindness and her positive impact on her patients. Option D suggests that Mary's patients like her because she is their \\"aunt.\\" This option is incorrect because there is no familial connection mentioned in the article. Furthermore, it is unlikely that all of her patients are related to her. In conclusion, the reason why Mary's patients like her a lot is because she is very kind, making option C the correct answer. Her kindness is emphasized throughout the article, as seen in her interactions with the old woman and her patients' appreciation of her caring nature."},{"instruction":"Можно, в соотвтствии с тем, что для системы логические диски ничем не отличаются от физических.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) said his conglomerate which is sitting on 116 billion of cash is âmore inclinedâ to repurchase stock than pay dividends as a means to use excess cash. Speaking on CNBC television on Monday Buffett said the corporate income tax rate cut signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in December is a âhuge tailwindâ for U.S. companies and that it is âreally good for Berkshire.â In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders on Saturday Buffett lamented his inability to find big companies to buy and said his goal is to make âone or more huge acquisitionsâ of non-insurance businesses to bolster results at Berkshire. Buffett said finding things to buy at a âsensible purchase priceâ has become a challenge and is a major reason Berkshire is awash with 116 billion of low-yielding cash and government bonds whose average maturity was 88 days as of the end of 2017. âI am fairly confident we will find ways to deployâ Berkshireâs excess cash Buffett said on CNBC. âThe best chance to deploy money is when things are going down.â Buffett says he has confidence in Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) Chief Executive Tim Sloan as he tried to move the third-largest U.S. bank past scandals over how it treated customers including by creating unauthorized accounts. Buffett likened the situation to when he was installed in 1991 as chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc after a former chief executive failed to tell regulators that a trader was submitting fake bids at Treasury auctions. âDigging your way out of it takes time â Buffett said. â He âs got a lot to clean up.â Buffett raised red flags about ordinary investors using borrowed cash to buy stocks or buying âon margin.â Buffett said it was âcrazyâ to borrow money to buy stocks and that âit is insane to risk something you have and needâ for the sake of leveraging up on stocks. Buffett said investors might get a âeuphoric surgeâ if they double their money in stocks but would not be âhappier.â","output":"The task is asking you to: 1.

Now, we can find out the work done by 10 men in one day: 10 men × 1 day = 10 × (W/100) = W/10 Step 4: Calculate the work done by 15 women in one day. Considering that 10 men and 15 women together complete the work in 6 days, the work done by 15 women in one day is: 15 women × 6 days = W (from step 1) 15 women × 1 day = W/6 Step 5: Subtract the work done by 10 men in one day from the work done by 15 women in one day. We can find out the work done by 5 women in one day: (W/6) - (W/10) = Work done by 5 women in one day Step 6: Calculate the work done by one woman in one day. Divide the work done by 5 women in one day by 5: [(W/6) - (W/10)]/5 = Work done by 1 woman in 1 day Step 7: Calculate the days required for one woman to complete the job alone. Now, divide the total work (W) by the work done by 1 woman in 1 day: W/[(W/6) - (W/10)] = Days required for one woman to complete the work alone Take the equation and simply calculations: W/[(W/6) - (W/10)] = Days required for 1 woman to complete the work (6 × 10) / [(10 - 6)] = Days required for 1 woman to complete the work (Canceling out 'W') 60 / 4 = Days required for 1 woman to complete the work 15 = Days required for 1 woman to complete the work Since the given options don't match the calculated answer, there might be a mistake in the options provided or the question information."},{"instruction":"Here are some concepts: branch, create, table What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"When you create a table, it's like making a special chart with rows and columns, and putting a branch in it is like adding a little tree that helps sort and organize the information inside the chart."},{"instruction":"North Korea states intention to restart reactors, throws out IAEA inspectors and takes down inspection cameras, announces immediate withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and makes threats of war if the UN or the United States imposes sanctions.

Your incorrect answers should be similar to the given correct answer such that it will pose a challenge for students to distinguish the two. A good incorrect answer should prevent those who skip the paragraph from answering the question. The incorrect answer should not be trivial, in the sense that they should not be easily eliminated without reading the paragraph. Paragraph- Sent 1: With a budget of 329 million, LSC provides civil legal assistance to low-income people in every county in America, Kleiman said. Sent 2: NLAP was created in 1968. Sent 3: A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. Sent 4: In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. Sent 5: On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records.

Hanssen has been recalled from a detail post at the State Department to FBI headquarters ostensibly to head up a new division specializing in Information Assurance. Initially, Hanssen insists on a strict formality between the two men. He frequently rails against the bureaucracy of the FBI and complains that only those who regularly \\"shoot guns\\" are considered for senior positions instead of those, like himself, who are involved in vital national security matters. He calls the bureau's information technology systems antiquated and laments the lack of coordination and information exchange with other intelligence agencies. Eventually, Hanssen becomes a friend and mentor to O'Neill and takes a personal interest in him and his wife Juliana (Caroline Dhavernas), who is suspicious of Hanssen and resents his intrusions. A devout Catholic who is also a member of Opus Dei, Hanssen urges O'Neill, a lapsed Catholic, and his secular East German-born wife to become active churchgoers. O'Neill finds no evidence of Hanssen leading a secret double life and develops a growing respect for his boss, so he confronts his handler in the undercover assignment, Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney), and she admits that the sexual deviance allegations are only a secondary consideration. Hanssen is suspected of spying for the Soviet Union and Russia for years and being responsible for the deaths of agents working for the United States.

Observing the abundance of game birds Martin wrote: There is plenty of land and water fowl in this isle—as hawks, eagles of two kinds (the one grey and of a larger size, the other much less and black, but more destructive to young cattle), black cock, heath-hen, plovers, pigeons, wild geese, ptarmigan, and cranes. Of this latter sort I have seen sixty on the shore in a flock together. The sea fowls are malls of all kinds—coulterneb, guillemot, sea cormorant, &c. The natives observe that the latter, if perfectly black, makes no good broth, nor is its flesh worth eating; but that a cormorant, which hath any white feathers or down, makes good broth, and the flesh of it is good food; and the broth is usually drunk by nurses to increase their milk. Similarly, Samuel Johnson noted that: At the tables where a stranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy is wanting. A tract of land so thinly inhabited, must have much wild-fowl; and I scarcely remember to have seen a dinner without them. The moor-game is every where to be had. That the sea abounds with fish, needs not be told, for it supplies a great part of Europe. The Isle of Sky has stags and roebucks, but no hares.

The Australian on Wednesday reported that the working relationship between the pair is effectively over and that the only person capable of bringing the internal battle to an end, the Prime Minister, 'isn't going to get rid of Peta' according to the front-bencher. However, a spokesperson from Julie Bishop's office told Daily Mail Australia that the Foreign Minister stands by her claims that the pair have not had a cross word and she does not want anyone else's job. There's been speculation in recent days that Bishop is primed to take over as leader, if needed. 'I genuinely don’t know anything about those claims,' the spokesperson said. Scroll down for video. Julie Bishop has proved to be one of the government's shining lights in 2014 but her recent rifts with the Prime Minister and his Chief of Staff is causing concern within Cabinet ranks. 'They are like two Siamese fighting fish stuck in the same tank!' A Liberal front-bencher is claimed to have said about Peta Credlin's apparent frosty relationship with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. The Foreign Minister and Deputy Liberal Leader has reportedly refused to take any orders from Peta Credlin, who is the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff. 'There is nothing that I am aware of that could possibly be reported coming from the Foreign Minister or her office, both (Bishop and Credlin) have said that there was nothing to the claims and I think it’s fair to say we need to go on what both have said, exactly.' There are also claims that the Foreign Minister has made a decision not to take any more orders from Peta Credlin while other senior Cabinet members reportedly also believe the PM's senior adviser wields too much influence. The Australian quoted the front-bencher as saying 'Tony isn’t going to get rid of Peta and Julie isn’t going to stop' and goes on to quote another MP 'what is Julie supposed to do? Perform worse to make Tony look better by way of comparison?' But Ms Credlin told the newspaper that 'we continue to work in a close and collegial way, I admire Julie for her tenacity and skill as a minister'. Julie Bishop's office stands by her claim that she has not had any 'cross words' with Peta Credlin and they have no idea where the suggestions of a bust-up have originated. One front-bencher says Julie Bishop is unhappy at the level of control Peta Credlin as the PM's chief of staff. The Foreign Minister's office denies the claims. Recent polls under-score her increasing popularity, with Julie Bishop's approval rating as preferred Liberal Leader more than doubling in the past five months, second only to Malcolm Turnbull. What has become apparent is that there are factions building within government ranks - those who back the strong-performing Foreign Minister and others, loyal to the PM, who believe she is being overly-promoted to his detriment. Recent polls underscore her increasing popularity, with Julie Bishop's approval rating as preferred Liberal Leader more than doubling in the past five months, second only to Malcolm Turnbull. The reports of this latest rift come after a week of high drama for the government front-bench, including a widely-reported argument between Julie Bishop and the PM himself after she read media reports that a male colleague would 'chaperone' her to the United Nations climate change conference in Lima, Peru. Two reported bust-ups in the past week with the PM's office. Julie Bishop took issue with Tony Abbott's decision to 'chaperone' her at the United Nations conference and now there are claims she is at odds with his chief of staff, Peta Credlin. The Foreign Minister was not consulted about the plan for Andrew Robb, who is ranked below Ms Bishop in the Cabinet, to shadow her and confronted Tony Abbott on the matter, reports said. It was further claimed that he was being sent to Peru with the Deputy Liberal Party Leader to ensure that Australia did not over-commit on its climate change policy promises. The bust-ups have overshadowed a significant announcement in Lima by Ms Bishop that Australia will contribute 200 million to a global fund to help poorer nations tackle climate change. Prime Minister Abbott said it was fair and reasonable for the government to pledge a contribution despite having ruled it out at the G20 summit in Brisbane. 'We've seen things develop over the last few months,' he told reporters in Melbourne. Australia's commitment would contribute to emission reduction projects in the region, Mr Abbott added. Health Minister Peter Dutton, was not buying into the drama around Julie Bishop and Peta Credlin, on Wednesday. 'I see two highly competent people who are very effective at their job and serving their nation well,' he said. Julie Bishop enjoys strong support from within Cabinet but there are some MPs who claim her increasing profile is undermining the Prime Minister. Causing further consternation were revelations that the PM initially had no plans to send any of his ministers to the global climate negotiations in Peru, where up to 200 other countries would be. Ms Bishop will talk international climate policy ahead of next year's 2015 Paris conference, which is being held to achieve a universal agreement on climate change, from all the nations of the world. Mr Abbott last week admitted the government had been performing in a 'ragged' way in recent days.

Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President).

An additional 10 acres (4 ha) was also purchased from United States Senator William Maclay. The legislature met in the old Dauphin County courthouse for the next decade until a new capitol was constructed. A competition was held to determine the design of the capitol starting in 1816, which \\"was the first formal contest for [designing] an American statehouse\\". The designs submitted, including one from William Strickland, were rejected as being too expensive. Another contest was started in January 1819. Of the seventeen designs submitted, two were selected as semifinalists. One was from Harrisburg architect Stephen Hills and the other was from the designer of the Washington Monument, Robert Mills; Hills' design was selected. Hills had designed a \\"red-brick, Federal-style\\" capitol to \\"architecturally represent the function of democratic government.\\" Construction began on the Hills Capitol in 1819 and it was completed in 1822. The capitol's construction and subsequent furnishing was estimated to have cost 244,500. The Hills Capitol was visited by famous people, including the Marquis de Lafayette in 1825 and Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, (later King Edward VII) in 1860. Abraham Lincoln visited the capitol in 1861 as president-elect, and then his body lay in state there after his 1865 assassination. Pennsylvania's collection of Civil War battle flags, which were accumulated in 1866, was moved from the State Arsenal to the second floor of the capitol in 1872.

Chain of thought:","output":"It's not very likely that a sesame seed would be mistaken for a wood frog egg, though there might be some similarities in terms of size and shape. Here's a comparison: 1. Sesame seeds: These seeds are small, oval-shaped, and generally measure about 3-4 millimeters in length. They come in various colors like white, black, and brown, with a slightly shiny, smooth surface. 2. Wood frog eggs: Wood frog eggs are typically found in clusters within an egg mass. Each individual egg measures around 2-4 millimeters in diameter. They are gelatinous in appearance, encased in a transparent, jelly-like substance surrounding a black embryo. While there might be a slight resemblance in terms of size, the appearance and texture of wood frog eggs are quite different from sesame seeds. The gelatinous, transparent substance surrounding the black embryo in wood frog eggs distinguishes them from the hard, smooth surface of sesame seeds. Therefore, it is unlikely that a sesame seed would be mistaken for a wood frog egg by someone familiar with the two. However, someone who is not familiar with wood frog eggs could potentially confuse a sesame seed for an egg, especially if they see a single egg separated from the egg mass."},{"instruction":"Q:What is the first name of the person who is ashamed to let their parents know of their difficulties?

Also stick to the context of the given story. For example, if the story talks about \\"doctors\\", you can talk about \\"health\\" or \\"diagnosis\\", but don't mention \\"aliens\\". Avoid introducing any extra/irrelevant information, and use names instead of pronouns (e.g. he / she) wherever possible. Avoid simply negating the original middle, for example: \\"She likes cakes.\\" is changed to \\"She doesn't like cakes.\\" Problem:Beginning: Joe wanted to watch television. Middle: His antenna broke so he made one with aluminum foil. Ending: The foil helped his channels come in sharp and clear! Solution:","output":"Part #1: Slightly modify the middle part of the story. Usage: Middle part changed from \\"His antenna broke so he made one with aluminum foil.\\" to \\"His antenna broke, so he tried making one with aluminum foil.\\" The original middle part is slightly altered, changing \\"made\\" to \\"tried making\\" to indicate an attempt rather than success. Part #2: Make the story unlikely, improbable, or inconsistent. Usage: Changing \\"made\\" to \\"tried making\\" makes the story improbable because it introduces doubt in the result of Joe's attempt to make an antenna with aluminum foil. Part #3: The new sentence should minimally alter the given middle and use at most 4 new words added/existing words removed. Usage: The altered sentence changes 1 word (removes \\"made\\" and adds \\"tried making\\"). This minimal change meets the criteria by only adding 1 extra word. Part #4: The new sentence should be grammatically and syntactically correct. Usage: \\"His antenna broke, so he tried making one with aluminum foil.\\" is a grammatically and syntactically correct sentence. Part #5: Stick to the context of the given story. Usage: The modified sentence still talks about Joe's antenna breaking and him attempting to make a new one with aluminum foil. It remains within the context of the story. Part #6: Avoid introducing any extra/irrelevant information. Usage: No additional information beyond the change from \\"made\\" to \\"tried making\\" was introduced in the sentence. Part #7: Use names instead of pronouns (e.g. he / she) wherever possible. Usage: The modified sentence includes \\"he\\" as a pronoun for the character. It is considered appropriate in this case as the subject, \\"Joe,\\" has been introduced in the beginning. Part #8: Avoid simply negating the original middle. Usage: The modified sentence does not negate the original middle sentence.

Answer:","output":"The composer best known for his works Requiem in D minor and Pavane in F sharp minor is Gabriel Fauré. Born on May 12, 1845, in Pamiers, France, Fauré was a prominent French composer, organist, and pianist of the Romantic era. His music is characterized by its distinctive harmonic language, stylistic inventiveness, and delicate expressiveness, which greatly influenced the French music scene of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Gabriel Fauré's Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, is undoubtedly one of his most famous and enduring works. Composed between 1887 and 1890, the Requiem stands out from other settings of the traditional Latin funeral mass due to its unique selection and arrangement of the liturgical texts. Fauré chose to omit some sections and include others that are not part of the standard Requiem Mass texts, like the \\"Pie Jesu\\" and \\"In Paradisum.\\" This approach contributed to the composition's calm and meditative nature, often referred to as a \\"lullaby of death,\\" which sets it apart from the more dramatic and solemn Requiems of other composers like Mozart or Verdi. Fauré's Requiem is scored for mixed chorus, soloists (soprano and baritone), orchestra, and organ. The work is divided into seven movements: \\"Introit et Kyrie,\\" \\"Offertoire,\\" \\"Sanctus,\\" \\"Pie Jesu,\\" \\"Agnus Dei,\\" \\"Libera Me,\\" and \\"In Paradisum.\\" Each movement showcases Fauré's exceptional ability to create atmospheric and emotional music while displaying his innovative harmonic language and masterful command of the choral and orchestral textures. In addition to the Requiem, Fauré's Pavane in F-sharp minor, Op. 50, has become an essential piece in the orchestral repertoire. Composed in 1887, the Pavane is a brief but hauntingly beautiful work for orchestra and optional mixed choir. In its original form, the piece features the text \\"Les Danses aux environs d'Elbeuf\\" written by Count Robert de Montesquiou, a French poet and close friend of Fauré. However, the Pavane is now often performed as a purely orchestral piece without the choral part. The Pavane is characterized by its elegant, melancholic melody, which is set against a repeated rhythmic pattern reminiscent of a slow and stately dance from the Renaissance era. This graceful and evocative work showcases Fauré's ability to write music that is both emotionally expressive and exquisitely crafted in terms of form and structure. Throughout his long and distinguished career, Gabriel Fauré produced an extensive catalogue of compositions, including chamber music, orchestral works, sacred choral music, and numerous piano pieces and songs. However, it is through the Requiem in D minor and Pavane in F sharp minor that Fauré's unique voice and exceptional craftsmanship continue to captivate and inspire musicians and audiences worldwide."},{"instruction":"What is a shorter version of this: a polish parliamentary commission on wednesday adopted a draft motion appealing to german lawmakers to drop any questions of who owns land germany ceded to poland after world war ii .

Our Planet Money team goes back in time when automatic elevators made people just as worried. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Now, as Google and other companies work to create self-driving cars, there's a concern in the industry. This is the question. Will people be comfortable getting inside? Would you put your child in a car without a steering wheel? The very idea makes many of us nervous. But every new automatic device that enters our lives, from automatic doors to escalators, has had to face this awkward moment where people are skeptical and maybe scared. Steve Henn from NPR's Planet Money podcast has one example we hardly think of anymore. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: When elevators were invented, they were kind of terrifying. I mean, think about it. You're hanging hundreds of feet in the air by a cable. And elevator operators in those days guided the cars to level stops by hand. They opened and closed the doors manually. And sometimes, they made mistakes. Lee Gray wrote the definitive history of the passenger elevator. LEE GRAY: There were lots of times when as a businessman you might say, oh, the elevator's leaving. And you hurry up, and you sort of jump the gap into the car and land. And off you go just before the operator shuts the door. And if you're athletic, it's all good. If you trip and fall and you're laying half in and half out of the car, the operator's not going to have time to stop. And that ended rather badly. HENN: Now, this was not the image the elevator industry wanted for its brand-new transportation device. So they added doors with safety bumpers, automatic stopping. And eventually, they created a driverless elevator. And this was in 1900. This was amazing. It was the Google car of its era. And people hated it. GRAY: People walked in and looked and walked right back out. They would quickly step back out and try to find someone to say where's the operator? HENN: But then, in 1945, elevator operators in New York went on strike. New York City ground to a halt. The strike costs New York a hundred million dollars in lost taxes. It prevented one and a half million office workers from getting to work. Building owners demanded a change. And the elevator industry decided they had to convince people to rethink what an elevator was. GRAY: Early ads, they showed children pushing the buttons and grandma riding in the elevator car showing how safe this is. HENN: And for the nervous rider there was a soothing voice piped out of speakers when you walked inside. GRAY: This is an automatic elevator. Please press the button for the floor you desire. HENN: And this voice directed you to the biggest calming device ever invented, a big red button that said, stop. GRAY: It would say, you have pulled the emergency stop. If this is not an emergency, please push it back in. If this is an emergency, please use the phone. HENN: And these innovations worked. Today, you can almost count the number of elevator operators in New York City using your fingers and toes. And the lessons here are being examined by Google's designers right now as they build their self-driving car. But there's one part of the elevator's history Google does not want to repeat. The automatic elevator was invented around 1900, but it took more than 50 years before the public became comfortable and automatic elevators became ubiquitous. Steve Henn, NPR News.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. ||||| As NPR pointed out in 2015, \\"every new automatic device that enters our lives, from automatic doors to escalators, has had to face this awkward moment where people are skeptical and maybe scared.\\" When the first public railway opened in England in 1825, for example, people thought the human body wasn't made to withstand travel at speeds of 30 miles per hour for long periods of time, cultural anthropologist Genevieve Bell told the Wall Street Journal in 2011. She added that some even believed \\"that women's bodies were not designed to go at 50 miles an hour,\\" and worried that their \\"uteruses would fly out of [their] bodies as they were accelerated to that speed.\\" When elevators first became automated a century ago, meanwhile, some people were afraid to ride in them without an operator onboard—in much the same way some now fear not having a human at the helm of a driverless car. NPR talked to the guy who literally wrote the book on elevator history, Lee Gray, and he noted that when the automatic elevator was first invented, \\"People walked in and looked and walked right back out. They would try to find someone to say 'Where's the operator?'\\" Of course, there's a huge difference between a metal box moving slowly along an enclosed concrete shaft and a metal box with four wheels moving fast along an open concrete surface with hundreds of other such boxes. But the basic unease with not having a human in control is the same, and it's almost as irrational as expecting a human to operate an elevator. Public Misgivings about Self-Driving Cars It seems as if a new survey comes out every month revealing public doubts about self-driving cars. The results of a recent Deloitte survey of 22,000 consumers around the world revealed that \\"trust appears to be the biggest roadblock to selling the notion of self-driving cars.\\" Less than half of US consumers surveyed (47 percent) \\"trust a traditional car manufacturer to bring autonomous vehicles to market,\\" Deloitte found, while only 20 percent have confidence in Silicon Valley tech companies to get self-driving technology right. Just this week, yet another survey of 3,116 drivers conducted between January 31 and February 6 found that almost a quarter (24.8 percent) of respondents would never ride in a self-driving car. Even the new Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao earlier this week expressed concerns over negative public opinion on self-driving technology. \\"In particular, I want to challenge Silicon Valley, Detroit, and all other auto industry hubs to step up and help educate a skeptical public about the benefits of automated technology,\\" she said. I have my own doubts about autonomous technology, even after riding in several self-driving cars on public roads and testing vehicles with the latest semi-autonomous systems. But my reservations are about when fully autonomous technology will be perfected, not if it will be perfected—and become as normal as elevators. I'll take my chances with vehicle sensors and cameras that are always on the lookout and even in-car computers over distracted drivers and human shortcomings. I highly doubt that robot-driven cars will kill 30,000-plus people in roadway accidents each year in the US alone. The automatic elevator was invented circa 1900, but it took more than 50 years before the public became comfortable with the technology and human elevator operators became obsolete. I don't believe it will take that much time before self-driving cars catch on, and it may not even be that long before human drivers go the way of elevator operators. |||||Summary:","output":"Before automatic elevators became universally accepted, the public was highly sceptical of the technology, a situation that parallels today’s public doubts about self-driving cars, according to an NPR report from 2015. Steve Henn, of NPR’s Planet Money podcast, noted that people eventually embraced the elevator due to innovations such as big red stop buttons, safety bumpers and automatic stopping. The first automatic elevator was patented in 1900, but didn’t become ubiquitous until over 50 years later."},{"instruction":"This is some data: Hypermarcas, type, S.A.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Six. Arthropods are a diverse group of invertebrate animals that include insects, arachnids (e.g. spiders and scorpions), myriapods (e.g. centipedes and millipedes), and crustaceans (e.g. crabs and shrimps). This phylum has one of the largest number of species of any in the animal kingdom, and their evolutionary success is attributed to their tough exoskeletons, jointed appendages, and varying numbers of legs. Arthropods are characterized by their segmented bodies and jointed limbs, and the number of legs varies among the different classes: 1. Insects, which constitute the majority of arthropods, always have six legs. For example, ants, bees, mosquitoes, and butterflies are insects. 2. Arachnids typically have eight legs, with spiders, scorpions, mites, and ticks being common examples. 3. Myriapods possess a large number of legs (varying from 30-400), with centipedes and millipedes as the prime representatives. 4. Crustaceans, such as crabs and lobsters, usually exhibit five pairs of legs (thus ten legs in total). Since the question specifically mentions that most arthropods are insects, and every insect has six legs, the best answer choice is \\"six.\\" It is crucial to note that while insects represent the majority of arthropod species, arthropods as a whole can exhibit a wide range of leg numbers depending on their class and individual adaptations."},{"instruction":"Background: Goldfrapp are an English electronic music duo from London, formed in 1999. The duo consists of Alison Goldfrapp (vocals, synthesizer) and Will Gregory (synthesizer). Despite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, their 2000 debut studio album Felt Mountain did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synthpop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. Context: Supernature, Goldfrapp's third album, was released in August 2005. The album comprises pop and electronic dance music prominently featured on Black Cherry, but focuses more on subtle hooks instead of the large choruses that made up its predecessor. The band never intended to create dance music, however, previous releases were popular across nightclubs in North America and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album. Supernature debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum in the UK. As of February 2008, it had sold one million copies worldwide. The album received a Grammy Award nomination in 2007 for Best Electronic/Dance Album and \\"Ooh La La\\" was nominated for Best Dance Recording. The song was used for the iPhone 5S's commercial in 2013. \\"Ooh La La\\", the album's lead single, became Goldfrapp's first UK top five single. The song was chosen as the lead single \\"because it was up and in your face and carried on the theme of the glammy, discoey beat from the last album\\". \\"Ooh La La\\" became the first song performed by the band to feature the electric guitar and was cited as a highlight of the album by Allmusic. \\"Number 1\\" was released as the album's second single. Constructed around a synthesiser and bass arrangement, it was written about the importance of relationships. The album's third single \\"Ride a White Horse\\" was inspired by the disco era and reached number 15 in the UK. \\"Fly Me Away\\" was released as the album's fourth single, but did not perform as well as its predecessors. In 2006, Goldfrapp released We Are Glitter, a North American-only compilation of remixes from Supernature. It included a Flaming Lips remix of \\"Satin Chic\\", the band's favourite song from the album. Question: What type of music was it? Answer:","output":"The type of music in Goldfrapp's album Supernature is electronic dance music with elements of pop, glam rock, and synthpop. It has catchy tunes and dance beats that are fun to listen and dance to."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: The remaining 5% are scattered around other plate boundaries. A few earthquakes take place away from plate boundaries. These are intraplate earthquakes. Q: A few earthquakes take place away from plate boundaries, these are called what? A: Answer:","output":"A few earthquakes that take place away from plate boundaries are called intraplate earthquakes. These types of earthquakes occur within the interior of a tectonic plate, rather than at the boundaries where two plates meet. Intraplate earthquakes account for a small percentage of total earthquake activity, as the majority of seismic events are associated with interactions between tectonic plates. Intraplate earthquakes are relatively rare and can be attributed to various factors, including the reactivation of ancient faults, the accumulation of stress caused by the movement of adjacent tectonic plates, and human activities such as the injection of fluids underground, which can alter the state of stress in the Earth's crust. Areas with a history of intraplate earthquakes exhibit a higher level of seismic risk than what may be inferred from the plate tectonics theory alone, as these regions are not located near any known plate boundaries. Intraplate earthquakes are less predictable than interplate earthquakes due to their sporadic nature and the fact that the physical processes leading to their occurrence are not yet completely understood. Some well-known examples of intraplate earthquakes include the 1811–1812 New Madrid earthquakes in the central United States, the 2001 Bhuj earthquake in India, and the 1989 Newcastle earthquake in Australia. These events highlight the potential for significant damage and loss of life associated with intraplate seismic activity, even in regions that are not typically considered seismically active. In conclusion, while the majority of earthquakes occur along plate boundaries, a small percentage take place away from these locations. These earthquakes, referred to as intraplate earthquakes, may result from a diverse range of factors and further emphasize the need for comprehensive seismic risk assessment and preparedness, even in areas that are not situated near tectonic plate boundaries."},{"instruction":"What is the solution?

Formerly, it was also called \\"Urker Land\\". Emmeloord is the administrative center, located in the heart of the Noordoostpolder. The municipality has the largest land area in the Netherlands. (Lelystad and Terschelling both technically have more \\"total\\" area, but in both cases it is mostly \\"water\\" area.) - Vollenhove is a city in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Steenwijkerland, southwest of Steenwijk. Until the Noordoostpolder was drained, it was located on the coast of the Zuiderzee. - The Zuiderzee (old spelling \\"Zuyderzee\\") was a shallow bay of the North Sea in the northwest of the Netherlands, extending about 100 km (60 miles) inland and at most 50 km (30 miles) wide, with an overall depth of about 4 to 5 metres (1316 feet) and a coastline of about 300 km (200 miles). It covered . Its name means \\"southern sea\\" in Dutch, indicating that the name originates in Friesland, to the north of the Zuiderzee (cf. North Sea). In the 20th century the majority of the Zuiderzee was closed off from the North Sea (leaving the mouth of the inlet to become part of the Wadden Sea) and the salt water inlet changed into a fresh water lake called the IJsselmeer (IJssel Lake) after the river that drains into it, and by means of drainage and polders, an area of some was reclaimed as land. This land eventually became the province of Flevoland, with a population of nearly 400,000 (2011). - The River IJssel, sometimes called Gelderse IJssel (\\"Gueldern IJssel\\") to avoid confusion with the Hollandse IJssel, is the branch of the Rhine in the Dutch provinces of Gelderland and Overijssel. The Romans knew the river as Isala. The IJssel flows from Westervoort, east of the city of Arnhem, until it discharges into the IJsselmeer (\\"Lake IJssel\\", known prior to the 1932 completion of the Afsluitdijk as the Zuiderzee, a North Sea inlet). The River IJssel is one of the three major distributary branches (along with the rivers Nederrijn and Waal) into which the Rhine divides shortly after crossing the German-Dutch border. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - Overijssel (Dutch Low Saxon: \\"Oaveriessel\\" ) is a province of the Netherlands in the central-eastern part of the country. The province's name translates to \\"[Land] across the IJssel\\", from the perspective of the bishopric of Utrecht by which it was held until 1528. The capital city of Overijssel is Zwolle and the largest city is Enschede. The province has a population of 1,113,529 inhabitants. - Zwolle is a municipality and the capital city of the province of Overijssel, Netherlands.

The rest of the Netherlands speaks Dutch, Frisian or Low Franconian languages. They do not form a coherent language family. - Enschede, also known as \\"Eanske\\" in the local dialect of Twents, is a municipality and a city in the eastern Netherlands in the province of Overijssel and in the Twente region. The municipality of Enschede consisted of the city of Enschede until 1935, when the rural municipality of Lonneker, which surrounded the city, was annexed after the rapid industrial expansion of Enschede which began in the 1860s and involved the building of railways and the digging of the Twentekanaal. - Stad Vollenhove is a former municipality in the Dutch province of Overijssel . It consisted of the city of Vollenhove . It existed from 1818 to 1942 , when it merged with the municipality of Ambt Vollenhove , which covered the surrounding countryside . - Steenwijkerland is a municipality in the province Overijssel, in the eastern Netherlands.

Choices: - arnhem - belgium - center - central - enschede - europe - flevoland - kingdom of the netherlands - lelystad - most - netherlands - noordoostpolder - northwest - of - overijssel - rhine - river - south - southwest - steenwijkerland - terschelling - westervoort - zwolle The answer is:","output":"The entity with which 'stad Vollenhove' exhibits the relationship of 'located in the administrative territorial entity' is 'Steenwijkerland'. The information provided indicates that Vollenhove is a city in the Dutch province of Overijssel and is located in the municipality of Steenwijkerland. This is substantiated by the mention that \\"Vollenhove is a city in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Steenwijkerland, southwest of Steenwijk.\\" Furthermore, it is also mentioned that \\"Stad Vollenhove is a former municipality in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It existed from 1818 to 1942, when it merged with the municipality of Ambt Vollenhove, which covered the surrounding countryside\\". Steenwijkerland is a municipality in the province Overijssel, in the eastern Netherlands, as mentioned in the information provided. Therefore, the evidence suggests that Stad Vollenhove, or Vollenhove city, is a part of the Steenwijkerland municipality. It's important to note that while the city of Vollenhove is in the province of Overijssel, the answer to the question is not simply 'Overijssel', as the question specifically asks for the administrative territorial entity, which in this case would be about the city's municipality, not the province it is located in. The infrastructure of the Netherlands is organized into distinct levels of jurisdictions - municipalities being the lowest level, then followed by provinces and the national Government. Therefore, Vollenhove's direct administrative affiliation would indeed fall under the jurisdiction of the Steenwijkerland municipality within the province of Overijssel."},{"instruction":"How is \\"The purpose of the task was to review the historical health risk based on the 1966 and 1967 U.S. military testing, and to determine the types of herbicide exposure personnel in the training area may have experienced.\\" said in French?","output":"Le but de la tâche était d'examiner le risque pour la santé dans le passé basé sur les tests militaires américains de 1966 et 1967.

She wants to buy tickets for her and for three of her friends. One ticket cost is 90. How much money does Daria need to earn if she currently has only 189? If the answer is '171'; explain the reasoning:","output":"Let's break down the problem step-by-step. 1. Daria wants to buy tickets for herself and three of her friends, which means she needs a total of 4 tickets. 2. The cost of one ticket is 90. 3. To find out how much money she needs in total for the tickets, we need to multiply the cost per ticket by the number of tickets: 4 tickets * 90 per ticket = 360 4. Daria currently has 189. To find out how much more money she needs to earn, we need to subtract her current amount from the total amount needed: 360 (total amount) - 189 (current amount) = 171 So, Daria needs to earn an additional 171 to buy the tickets for her and her three friends. The reasoning is that we've calculated the total cost of the tickets and subtracted the amount she has already to find out how much more money she needs to earn."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given news headlines, an edited word and funniness labels.

Question 2: How would you use IBM Watson? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is specifically asking about potential applications of IBM Watson in the logistics industry. This question seeks answers as to how IBM Watson, the advanced AI technology platform, can be deployed in various activities within the logistics industry such as warehouse management, transportation, supply chain management, demand forecasting etc. The answer to this question would likely encompass potential uses of IBM Watson in providing real-time track-and-trace solutions, improving efficiency through predictive analytics, enhancing customer service through AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants, optimizing supply chain operations through data analytics and machine learning, and managing risk and compliance through cognitive analytics. On another end, question 2 is a more generalized question, which is asking how one could use IBM Watson. In this question, it doesn't specifically mention an industry or context, so the answers could be broad, including every possible application of IBM Watson like medical diagnosis, personalized education, financial advice, chatbots for various business, gaming, weather forecasting and more. It could also refer to the technical use of IBM Watson, such as how to set up and program Watson for various tasks. In conclusion, though both questions focus on the application of IBM Watson, the first question hones into its potential usage in the logistics industry, whereas the latter is more of a broad inquiry on how IBM Watson could be deployed in general. Moreover, the first defines a likely business perspective, while the second might well concern a technical user perspective."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: How many people did the subject of Murder in the Heartland murder?

Collins has been described by AllMusic as \\"one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond\\".

Ordinary space - This phrase is significant because it conveys the current state of the area being described. It refers to a room or space that may not have any remarkable features or may require transformation. 2. Extraordinary - This word is essential because it represents the desired outcome for the space. It signifies a major change or improvement, aiming to create an appealing and unique area. 3. Painting - This action is central to the transformation process. Painting implies altering the appearance of something, in this case, the ceiling, by applying a color or design to it, which serves as the primary method to achieve the desired result. 4. Ceiling - This refers to the specific part of a room or space that is being addressed. The ceiling is often overlooked or treated as a plain, functional part of a room and may not typically receive much attention. However, it becomes the central focus of the transformation in the sentence. 5. Unexpected color - This phrase highlights the importance of being unconventional in the choice of color for the ceiling. Choosing an unexpected color introduces an element of surprise, further contributing to the space's transformation from ordinary to extraordinary. In summary, the words \\"ordinary space,\\" \\"extraordinary,\\" \\"painting,\\" \\"ceiling,\\" and \\"unexpected color\\" hold the most importance in the sentence as they illustrate the process of transforming a common room into something remarkable through the creative act of painting the ceiling in a surprising color."},{"instruction":"Phillips was born in Albany, Georgia, to Sheryl (Jacks) and Phillip LaDon \\"Donnie\\" Phillips, Sr., and moved to Leesburg, Georgia when he was 12.

I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening. So much for my attempt at appearing “classy” and “sophisticated”…. How long did the author spend in Puerto Rico? - few weeks. - not enough information - Several hours. - Several days. Answer:","output":"In the provided narrative, expressed by the author, it is stated that they traveled to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. The duration of a long weekend typically extends from Friday through Sunday or Saturday through Monday. Therefore, the most accurate response to the question \\"How long did the author spend in Puerto Rica?\\" would be \\"Several days.\\" The story does not provide any information about the author's stay extending to a period of weeks. Since they were there for a \\"long weekend\\" this generally suggests a period of more, or less, than three to four days. Consequently, the responses \\"Several hours\\" and \\"few weeks\\" are not accurate based on the information provided in the narrative.

The tweet conveys feelings of annoyance and frustration caused by the loud thunder that disrupted the user's sleep. Breaking down the tweet, we can see the following elements that contribute to this negative sentiment: 1. \\"Yea so I'm mad\\" - The user explicitly states that they are feeling mad, which is a strong negative emotion. This phrase sets the tone for the rest of the tweet. 2. \\"LOUD ASS THUNDER\\" - The use of capitalization and adding \\"ass\\" as an intensifier here demonstrates the user's heightened emotions and annoyance. The word \\"loud\\" contributes to the negative perception as it suggests that the thunder was bothersome. 3. \\"just woke me up\\" - This phrase highlights that the event caused an abrupt interruption to the user's sleep. Usually, sleep is perceived as a peaceful state, so for it to be disrupted suggests a negative occurrence. 4. \\"ugh\\" - The use of this interjection reflects irritation and exasperation, further emphasizing the overall negative sentiment. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet is negative, as it conveys the user's frustration and annoyance due to the loud thunder interrupting their sleep. The strong word choices and tone communicate the user's negative emotions effectively."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Think slowly and carefully, before giving your answer.","output":"To answer the question of whether hippie culture was encouraged by the government in the Soviet Union, let's first consider the ideologies and values associated with hippie culture and the Soviet government. Hippie culture emerged in the 1960s in the United States as a countercultural movement that valued peace, love, and equality. Hippies often embraced non-conformist lifestyles, experimenting with drugs, and seeking alternative spiritual beliefs. They typically rejected consumerism, materialism, and traditional societal norms. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, was a socialist state that existed from 1922 to 1991. It was governed by the Communist Party and was characterized by its one-party political system and centralized state control over the economy. The Soviet government valued conformity, uniformity, and adherence to the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Given these opposing values and ideologies, it is unlikely that the Soviet government would have encouraged hippie culture. Moreover, the Soviet Union had strict censorship and control over its population, making it difficult for alternative and countercultural ideas to spread. The Soviet authorities often perceived Western countercultural movements as a threat to their political and social order. So, based on the conflicting ideologies and values between hippie culture and the Soviet Union, as well as the strict control exerted by the Soviet government, it can be concluded that hippie culture was not encouraged by the government in the Soviet Union."},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Plot title: The Seventh Seal Movie plot: Disillusioned knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) and his nihilistic squire JÃ¶ns (Gunnar BjÃ¶rnstrand) return after fighting in the Crusades and find Sweden being ravaged by the plague. On the beach immediately after their arrival, the knight encounters Death (Bengt Ekerot), personified as a pale, black-cowled figure resembling a monk. The knight, in the middle of a chess game he has been playing alone, challenges Death to a chess match, believing that he can forestall his demise as long as the game continues. Death agrees, and they start a new game. The other characters in the story, except for Jof in the end, do not see Death, and when the chess board comes out at various times in the story, they believe the knight is continuing his habit of playing alone. Death and Antonius Block choose sides for the chess game; Death gets the black pieces. The knight with his squire heads for his castle. Along the way, they pass some actors, Jof (Nils Poppe) and his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), with their infant son, Mikael, and their actor-manager, Skat (Erik Strandmark). Jof is also a juggler and has visions of Jesus and Mary, but Mia is skeptical of them. The knight and squire enter a church where a fresco of the Dance of Death is being painted. The squire draws a small figure representing himself. The knight goes to the confessional where he is joined by Death in the robe of a priest, to whom he admits that his life has been futile and without meaning, but that he wants to perform \\"one meaningful deed.\\"[7] Upon revealing the chess strategy that will save his life, the knight discovers that the priest is Death, who promises to remember the tactics. Leaving the church, the knight speaks to a young woman (Maud Hansson) who has been condemned to be burned at the stake for consorting with the devil. Shortly thereafter, the squire searches an abandoned village for water. He saves a servant girl (Gunnel Lindblom) from being raped by a man robbing a corpse.

Eurozone unemployment stays at record 11 percent Eurozone unemployment at record high in June Give the answer on a scale from 0 - 5, where 0 is \\"not similar at all\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\".","output":"I would rate the similarity of these two sentences as a 4.5 out of 5. Both sentences are discussing the same topic, which is Eurozone unemployment. They are conveying the same general message about the unemployment situation in the Eurozone, but they do so with slightly different focuses and wording. 1. \\"Eurozone unemployment stays at record 11 percent\\": This sentence emphasizes that Eurozone unemployment remains at a record high level. The addition of the word \\"stays\\" lets the reader know that the rate has not changed recently, maintaining its height. By providing the specific percentage (11 percent), the reader can understand the level of unemployment that is considered a record high. 2. \\"Eurozone unemployment at record high in June\\": This sentence lets the reader know about the record high unemployment specifically in the month of June. The statement doesn't indicate whether the situation has remained the same for a while or if it has just reached this record high. The percentage of unemployment is not mentioned, but the key message regarding the record high unemployment is still conveyed to the reader. While the sentences have different focuses (one on the consistent percentage and the other on the month), they ultimately convey the same general message: that Eurozone unemployment has reached a record high. The reason for the 4.5 rating instead of a 5 is mainly due to the slight differences in focus and the absence of the specific percentage in the second sentence.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. When should sportspeople consider taking protein supplements? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. When they are fasting B. When they are traveling C. not enough information D. When they are eating a high protein meal Answer:","output":"B. When they are traveling"},{"instruction":"Premise: A small dog is walking on green grass carrying a stick in its mouth.

We came here expecting mediocre bar food, but it was late and we were hungry...they were open!! :) EVERYTHING we ate was delicious!

What a delicious combination! I got it with sweet potato fries; they were sprinkled with sugar and came with a sweet dip. John got the steak sandwich with the herb fries. He loved his sandwich and liked his fries alright. He was really loving that sauce that came with the avocado fries, so they gladly brought him some more.

Is \\"The second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod Shuffle uses a single 3.5 mm minijack phone connector which acts as both a headphone jack and a data port for the dock.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, your statement is correct. The second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod Shuffle combined the headphone jack and data port into a single 3.5 mm minijack phone connector, which served both functions. This design choice allowed Apple to save space and simplify the device further, conforming to their minimalist design philosophy. The iPod Shuffle was introduced in 2005 as a low-cost, entry-level alternative to other iPod models. Unlike other iPods, the Shuffle did not have a screen and relied on the random playback of songs, staying true to its name. Despite its lack of a display, it still offered the basic functionalities of an MP3 player, like play, pause, skip and volume controls. Here is a brief summary of the different generations of iPod Shuffle and how the headphone jack and data port evolved across these generations: 1. First-generation iPod Shuffle (2005): This model featured a USB-cap design, where the USB connector was concealed under a removable cap, much like a USB flash drive. The USB connector was used for charging and syncing, while a separate 3.5 mm headphone jack was utilized for audio output. 2. Second-generation iPod Shuffle (2006): In the second generation, Apple introduced the combination of the headphone jack and data port into a single 3.5 mm minijack phone connector. This enabled the device to be smaller and simpler. The syncing and charging were done with a special dock that connected to the 3.5 mm connector. 3. Third-generation iPod Shuffle (2009): The third-generation Shuffle continued to use the 3.5 mm minijack phone connector that combined the functions of headphone jack and data port. This model introduced a smaller size and voice prompts to compensate for the lack of display. It did not have any physical playback control buttons on the device, instead relying on the headset's remote control. 4. Fourth-generation iPod Shuffle (2010): Apple returned to the previous design with physical playback controls on the device in the fourth-generation Shuffle, while retaining the single 3.5 mm minijack phone connector for both headphone jack and data port purposes. The design of the fourth-generation model remained the same until it was discontinued in 2017. In conclusion, it is accurate to say that the second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod Shuffle used a combination of the headphone jack and data port in one single 3.5 mm minijack phone connector for a streamlined and minimalist design."},{"instruction":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"The best\\" A:","output":"Based on the given review text, \\"The best\\", it would likely be a ★★★★★ rating, as the description suggests the highest level of satisfaction with the product or service."},{"instruction":"Here is an article: Select an album...

In this statement, the emphasis is on the importance of amendments to the Criminal Code as they relate to addressing the issue of financing terrorism. These changes in the legal framework aim to make it harder for individuals or organizations to provide financial support to terrorist groups and activities. By criminalizing this type of financial assistance, the goal is to reduce the resources available to terrorists, thereby limiting their ability to plan and execute attacks. The amendments cover various aspects of financing terrorism, which may include: 1. Direct financial assistance: Providing funds and monetary resources to terrorist organizations, their members, or activities. 2. Indirect financial assistance: Providing financial services, such as money transfers, loans, or credit, to terror groups or individuals associated with them. 3. Funding terrorist recruitment and training: Supporting the process of recruiting and training terrorists, including providing financial support to recruitment networks or training camps. 4. Money laundering: Using business and financial networks to launder funds that are intended to support terrorist activities or organizations. 5. Facilitating access to funding sources: Helping terror groups and individuals obtain financial resources by introducing them to potential donors or fundraising activities. 6.

Downs Syndrome. Hospital report said she was 'about 14' but other media have reported she is 11. She was accused by Muslim neighbours of burning. Islamic religious texts. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Rimsha Masih: A Young Girl With Down Syndrome Caught in the Midst of Religious Controversy In a recent incident that has brought the global spotlight on to Pakistan, a young girl named Rimsha Masih found herself facing severe and life-threatening accusations. Rimsha, who reportedly suffers from Down Syndrome, became the victim of a dubious situation that involved allegations raised by her Muslim neighbors. They accused the young girl of burning Islamic religious texts—an act that is considered highly offensive and blasphemous in the Islamic faith. Rimsha's age has been a point of contention in media reports, with some claiming she is as young as 11, while a hospital report suggests she is \\"about 14\\" years old. Even though her exact age remains uncertain, Rimsha is undeniably just a child. And yet, she has become embroiled in a heated debate that has implications far beyond her years and her comprehension. Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder, which typically presents with distinct physical attributes and intellectual disability. It is crucial to consider how Rimsha's condition might have played a role in this situation, particularly in terms of her understanding of actions and their potentially severe consequences. However, the fact that Rimsha has Down Syndrome appears to have done little to mitigate the anger and outrage generated by her alleged actions. The intense scrutiny Rimsha faces is undoubtedly due in part to the fact that she belongs to a Christian family living in a predominantly Muslim neighborhood. Although religious and sectarian tensions run deep in many parts of Pakistan, the accusations against Rimsha Masih have acquired a particularly sinister dimension: they have raised questions about the extent to which certain members of society seek to exploit religious differences for their ends. These questions are not unique to Pakistan alone, but they become all the more urgent in a country where religious conflict often reaches boiling point. This case further highlights the importance of revisiting and debating the nation's strict blasphemy laws, which have long been a subject of controversy and criticism both within Pakistan and beyond its borders. Repeated instances wherein accusations of blasphemy have led to mob justice and even fatal consequences have been condemned internationally. In Rimsha's case, the fragile and emotionally charged environment she finds herself in could put her life and safety at serious risk. In conclusion, the case of Rimsha Masih serves as a stark reminder of the complex and deeply entrenched challenges that contemporary Pakistan continues to face. As a young girl with Down Syndrome accused of a significant religious offense, Rimsha has unwittingly become a symbol of the broader issues concerning sectarian tensions and discriminatory practices in the country. It is essential that her case is carefully and fairly examined, taking into account her age, mental capacity, and the potentially malicious motivations of those around her. Only then can justice truly be served, and perhaps bring about a much-needed sense of introspection, tolerance, and understanding among communities in Pakistan and beyond."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? delicate ambiguity","output":"Oh, a movie review!

Though known by several names in the past, the most common term \\"Algonquin\\" has been suggested to derive from the Maliseet word elakomkwik (IPA: [elae'gomogwik]): \\"they are our relatives/allies\\". The Algonquin first met Europeans when Samuel de Champlain came upon a party led by the Kitcisipirini Chief Tessouat at Tadoussac, in eastern present-day Quebec, in the summer of 1603. They were celebrating a recent victory over the Iroquois, with the allied Montagnais and Etechemins (Malecite). Champlain did not understand that the Algonquins were socially united by a strong totem/clan system rather than the European-styled political concept of nationhood. The several Algonquin bands each had its own chief. Within each band, the chief depended on political approval from each of the band's clan leaders. Champlain needed to cultivate relationships with numerous chiefs and clan leaders. From 1603, some of the Algonquin allied with the French under Champlain. This alliance proved useful to the Algonquin, who previously had little to no access to European firearms. Champlain made his first exploration of the Ottawa River during May 1613 and reached the fortified Kitcisipirini village at Morrison Island. Unlike the other Algonquin communities, the Kitcisipiriniwak did not change location with the seasons. They had chosen a strategic point astride the trade route between the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. They prospered through the collection of beaver pelts from native traders passing through their territory. They also were proud of their corn fields. At first, the French used the term \\"Algonquin\\" only for a second group, the Wawackeciriniwak. However, by 1615, they applied the name to all of the Algonquin bands living along the Ottawa River. Because of keen interest by tribes to gain control of the lower Ottawa River, the Kitcisipiriniwak and the Wawackeciriniwak came under fierce opposition. These two large groups allied together, under the leadership of Sachem Charles Parcharini, to maintain the Omamiwinini identity and territory. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What else should I know about this period?","output":"During this period, the Algonquin people first met Europeans like Samuel de Champlain and began to form alliances with them, particularly the French. This was helpful for the Algonquin, as they gained access to European firearms. The Algonquin tribes had a strong totem/clan system, and each band had its own chief. They lived in different areas along the Ottawa River, like the Kitcisipiriniwak at Morrison Island. They built strategic relationships and traded beaver pelts, while also being proud of their corn fields. Remember, this was a time when the Algonquin people were trying to protect their territory and identity, so they worked together with their allies to do so."},{"instruction":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: \\"Paint It Black\\" was released before being included on the \\"Aftermath\\" \\"Paint It Black\\" (originally released as \\"Paint It, Black\\") is a song by the English rock band The Rolling Stones, written by the songwriting partnership of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, and first released as a single on 6 May 1966.

Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

Premise: \\"A man wearing a red tank top and white hat is sitting on a towel at the beach.\\" Statement: \\"Man sitting on the sand at the Mojave desert.\\" Step 1: Compare the locations. - Premise: Beach - Statement: Mojave desert As the beach and Mojave desert are two different locations, this already shows that the premise is not true based on the provided statement. Step 2: Compare the clothing items. - Premise: Man wearing a red tank top and white hat - Statement: No information about clothing As there's no information about the man's clothing in the statement, we cannot make a conclusion about whether this part of the premise is true or false. Step 3: Compare the sitting positions. - Premise: Man is sitting on a towel - Statement: Man is sitting on the sand In this scenario, the man is sitting on different surfaces, a towel in the premise, and sand in the statement. This difference also suggests that the premise is not true. Based on these comparisons, the premise \\"A man wearing a red tank top and white hat is sitting on a towel at the beach.\\" is not true according to the statement \\"Man sitting on the sand at the Mojave desert.\\" since they do not match in location and surface where the man is sitting, and there's no information about clothing in the statement."},{"instruction":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -a = 7220 - 7210 for a.","output":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step like we're explaining it to a five-year-old.

A new class. Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Lessons of a Lifetime\\" Genre: Drama, Inspirational Plot Summary: Steven Hundert is a passionate and dedicated history teacher at the prestigious St. Bartholomew Academy. Known for his ability to inspire and deeply impact the lives of his students, Hundert's career is most-remembered for his famous \\"Great Students of the Past\\" competition – a yearly event that challenges the brightest students to showcase their knowledge of history and critical thinking skills. Hundert's life takes a surprising turn when he becomes responsible for teaching a group of diverse and non-traditional students. Plot: The story begins with Steven Hundert reminiscing about his past teaching experiences and the significant impact he's had on the lives of his students. Hundert, now retired from teaching, receives a phone call from his mentee and former student, David Wilson, who is now the headmaster at St. Bartholomew Academy. David offers Hundert an opportunity to teach a newly created class for non-traditional students. The students in this class have exceptional talents and a passion for learning; however, they don't fit the typical mold of the prestigious academy. Initially hesitant due to his retirement, Hundert eventually agrees and decides to embrace the challenge head-on. He brings his signature charisma, depth, and thought-provoking lessons to this new group of students. The class comprises individuals from diverse backgrounds – a rebellious street artist, a child prodigy in robotics, a passionate young environmentalist, and a girl who escaped a war-torn country seeking knowledge and hope. As Hundert gets to know each student, he learns about their unique backstories and the struggles they've faced throughout their lives. This newfound understanding prompts him to tailor his teachings and methods to reflect the individual needs and abilities of each student. Hundert inspires them to think critically about history and connect the significance of the past to the world they live in today. Despite initial skepticism from the school's board members and other teachers, Hundert's fresh approach resonates powerfully with his students. As the class makes significant progress and becomes a tight-knit community, the once-skeptical faculty begins to acknowledge the power of unconventional teaching methods and the importance of adapting to different learning styles. Feeling inspired by his students' progress, Hundert reintroduces the \\"Great Students of the Past\\" competition to the school, inviting his class to participate in the event. The competition tests knowledge, moral reasoning, and public speaking skills. The diverse group of students brings a fresh perspective and unique insight to the competition, challenging the status quo and giving long-standing traditions a new meaning. Through the competition, the students gain newfound confidence in themselves, as well as a stronger connection to the lessons of history. The event culminates in a once-rebellious and misunderstood student using her unique background to provide an inspiring interpretation of the subject matter, resulting in a joyous victory. In the end, Hundert's passion for teaching and the invaluable contributions of his non-traditional students leave an indelible mark on the academy, changing the institution for the better. The \\"Lessons of a Lifetime\\" Hundert has shared with his students have shaped them into well-rounded individuals ready to positively impact the world. The film ends with Hundert reflecting on his impactful teaching career, invigorated by his time with the new class and grateful for the opportunity to learn from each student. As he readies for a quiet but well-earned retirement, the audience is left with an inspiring reminder of the power of unconventional knowledge, personal growth, and the influence mentors and teachers have in shaping future generations."},{"instruction":"Article: Setting national renewable energy targets can be an important part of a renewable energy policy and these targets are usually defined as a percentage of the primary energy and/or electricity generation mix.

This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces.

It marked the end of the authoritarian regime, Estado Novo, which had been in power since 1933 under Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar, and later, Marcelo Caetano. The Carnation Revolution brought significant political and social change to Portugal, ultimately leading to the independence of its overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as the restoration of democracy in the country. The coup was led by a group of left-wing military officers who were discontent with the prolonged and unsuccessful Portuguese Colonial War in African territories such as Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau. The military officers, known as the Armed Forces Movement (MFA), were determined to bring the regime to an end and establish a democratic system. The revolution got its name from the fact that the soldiers involved in the coup wore red carnations in their uniforms and placed them in the barrels of their guns as a sign of peace. Following the Carnation Revolution, a transitional period known as PREC (Processo Revolucionário Em Curso) lasted for about two years. This period was marked by social unrest, political turmoil, and power disputes between left- and right-wing factions. During this time, the Portuguese government and military withdrew from their overseas colonies, recognizing the independence of territories such as Angola and Mozambique in a series of negotiations in 1975. This led to a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from these territories, seeking to return to Portugal or find new opportunities elsewhere.

With a week off from school, her family is spending some time driving out of state to visit her grandma, Kathy, who has a cabin up in the snowy mountains. Margaret always enjoys spending time with her grandma because she has interesting stories and makes some of the best pie around. Also, they always go skiing when visiting the cabin so Margaret is excited for that. Whose joints will be more sore after skiing? Answer:","output":"There is no definitive answer to this question, as it largely depends on many individual factors for both Margaret and her grandma, Kathy. However, we can discuss some general points that may contribute to joint soreness for each of them after skiing. When it comes to Margaret, as a sophomore in high school, she is likely young and has more resilient joints and a higher level of overall physical fitness. This could potentially result in reduced joint soreness after skiing due to her body's ability to recover faster. Moreover, younger individuals often have better flexibility, which can help in reducing the risk of injury and muscle imbalances that can contribute to joint soreness. However, her level of skiing expertise may also play a role; if Margaret is still learning and not well-practiced in skiing, this could result in more joint strain as she tries to keep her balance and control her movements, potentially leading to soreness. On the other hand, Kathy, being Margaret's grandmother, is likely older and may have certain age-related factors that can contribute to joint soreness after skiing. As we age, there is a natural decline in muscle mass, bone density, and joint flexibility, making older individuals more susceptible to joint soreness and potential injuries. Arthritis or other age-related joint problems might be present, which can exacerbate soreness after physical activities like skiing. However, it is important to note that Kathy's experience in skiing, and possibly her expertise in the sport, may help in managing joint strain during the activity. If Kathy has been skiing for many years, she would be more familiar with proper skiing techniques that can minimize the stress on her joints. In addition, if Kathy practices regular physical activity, her overall fitness level may be higher than expected for her age, which would also affect her experience of joint soreness after skiing. In conclusion, while we cannot definitively say whose joints will be more sore after skiing, it is likely that Margaret may experience less soreness due to her youth and resilience in physical activities. However, individual factors such as skiing expertise, overall fitness level, and any existing joint concerns must also be taken into account, which may cause a different outcome. The best way for both Margaret and Kathy to minimize joint soreness after skiing is to warm up properly before skiing, maintain proper skiing techniques while on the slopes, and engage in stretches and cooldown exercises afterward to reduce any potential stress on their joints."},{"instruction":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Great song , Great Heart Review: The medley of the two songs was beautifully done especially with the high notes at the end of the song.

To understand the sentiment behind this phrase, let us break down the elements: 1. \\"Dripping with\\" - This phrase is often used to exaggerate the degree to which something possesses a particular quality. It can be used in both positive and negative contexts. In this case, the adjective that follows \\"dripping with\\" might determine the overall sentiment. If it were a positive adjective (e.g., dripping with charm), the sentiment could be positive. However, in this example, the adjective that follows is \\"cliche,\\" which is generally considered negative. 2. \\"Cliche\\" - A cliche refers to an overused expression, idea, or element that has become trite, unoriginal, or predictable due to its repeated use. In general, cliches are perceived negatively because they indicate a lack of creativity, originality, or insight. They are often associated with mediocrity and predictability. When combining these elements, the sentiment of the sentence \\"dripping with cliche and\\" suggests that the subject being discussed is overly saturated with cliches, to the point that it is tiresome, unimpressive, or even annoying. The phrase most likely intends to highlight that the subject lacks originality and depth, as it heavily relies on commonly used, repetitive elements. However, without knowing the full context of the sentence or what follows the \\"and,\\" it is hard to provide an exact judgment about the overall sentiment. The phrase could be completed with another negative descriptor, solidifying the disapproving stance, or it could take on a more nuanced meaning if paired with a surprising or unexpected element. Nonetheless, the initial sentiment of the sentence is inclined towards negativity and criticism."},{"instruction":"Short movie review: be sensational Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Step 1: Watch the short movie As an AI, I cannot physically watch a movie, but I can refer to any details or descriptions you provide about the movie for my review.

CHAPTER XVI. THE PANNIER He was still pacing there when an hour or so before sunset--some fifteen hours after setting out--they stood before the entrance of a long bottle-necked cove under the shadow of the cliffs of Aquila Point on the southern coast of the Island of Formentera. He was rendered aware of this and roused from his abstraction by the voice of Asad calling to him from the poop and commanding him to make the cove. Already the wind was failing them, and it became necessary to take to the oars, as must in any case have happened once they were through the coves narrow neck in the becalmed lagoon beyond. So Sakr-el-Bahr, in his turn, lifted up his voice, and in answer to his shout came Vigitello and Larocque.

Sakr-el-Bahr gave the word to row, and Vigitello blew a second and longer blast. The oars dipped, the slaves strained and the galeasse ploughed forward, time being kept by a boatswain's mate who squatted on the waist-deck and beat a tomtom rhythmically.

If they had to describe their perfect day in London, what exactly would it involve? This was a question Mashable put to various celebrities — from Kate Winslet to Colin Farrell — on the red carpet at the 2015 London Film Festival. While there were quite a mixture of different responses, two of the recurring themes were parks and cycling. \\"My perfect day in London is a day like today, where it's brisk but it's bright,\\" actor Michael Smiley told Mashable, \\"I get on the bicycle and I wear my long cotton socks and my riding boots, and I go off for a cycle along the South Bank.\\" Composer Daniel Pemberton, who wrote the music for Steve Jobs, also enjoyed cycling along the South Bank — albeit in a slightly different capacity. \\"Cycling in London is the best thing you can do, it's fantastic,\\" he said. \\"Cycling when you're drunk, late at night, back along the South Bank — that's my favourite thing.\\" Jeff Daniels, however, had a more simple idea. \\"A perfect day in London is to walk outside the hotel and there's no paparazzi,\\" he said.

What was this article about?","output":"This article delves into the fantasy of well-known celebrities including actors and composers such as Kate Winslet, Colin Farrell, Michael Smiley, Daniel Pemberton, and Jeff Daniels, envisioning their perfect day out in the bustling city of London. This question was presented to multiple celebrities during various interviews on the red carpet at the 2015 London Film Festival. Actor Michael Smiley described his flawless day in London as one with a brisk yet bright weather, perfect for a bike ride. He visualises starting his day wearing long cotton socks and riding boots and heading off for a peaceful cycle along the South Bank. The appreciation for cycling in London similarly echoed in the composer Daniel Pemberton's response as well. He glorified the idea of cycling late in the night while being somewhat tipsy, claiming it to give him a sense of euphoria when he rides back along the South Bank in such a state. Meanwhile, actor Jeff Daniels has a simpler image of his perfect day in London. For him, a perfect day would mean walking outside his hotel and not being met with paparazzi. This indicates his preference for a more private, calm day in the city away from the hustle and prying eyes of the media. The narrative portrays that the perfect day in London for most celebrities revolves around enjoying a scenic bike ride and maintaining an appreciation for the peaceful, tranquil moments amid their usually hectic lives. Parks and cycling seemed to be recurring themes in their responses, indicating a clear inclination towards activities surrounded by nature and exercise. However, the variance in their responses also shows how each celebrity values different aspects of their day out in London, be it peaceful solitude, a nighttime adventure, or a brisk day outdoors."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"Two teen guys are doing skateboard tricks at a skate park.\\" is it true that \\"There are people skating.\\"?

Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"Sure, let's analyze the numbers before answering the question. Last month: - William read 6 books. - Brad read thrice as many books as William, which means Brad read 3 * 6 books = 18 books. This month: - Brad read 8 books. - William read twice as much as Brad, which means William read 2 * 8 books = 16 books. Now, let's calculate the total number of books read by each person across the two months: - William: last month (6 books) + this month (16 books) = 6 + 16 = 22 books. - Brad: last month (18 books) + this month (8 books) = 18 + 8 = 26 books. So, Brad has read more books across the two months with a total of 26 books, while William has read a total of 22 books. The difference between the two is 26 - 22 = 4 books."},{"instruction":"Article: In the 1920s and 30s the airlines were just beginning. It was unusual for people to travel by air because it was expensive and dangerous. In those days, there were no flight attendants to look after the passengers. Young men ,or \\"stewards\\" helped the passengers onto the airplane and carried the passengers' luggage but they did not provide food and drinks. _ Ellen Church was born in 1904 on a farm in Iowa. She was a different child. She didn't want to work on a farm or marry a farmer --she wanted a more adventurous life. Ellen studied to be a nurse at the University of Minnesota and then got a job in a hospital. For the next few years she stayed at the hospital but also took flying lessons and got her pilot's license. Ellen was twenty-five years old when she first got in touch with Boeing Air Transport. She loved flying but she understood that airlines were a man's world. Although women like Emelia Earheart were becoming famous, she realized it was impossible for a woman to have a career as a pilot .But she had another idea. Most people were frightened of flying because. flying was still an unreliable way to travel. There were often delays ,many crashes and the bad weathers made many passengers sick. Ellen thought nurses could take care of passengers during flights and B.A.T. agreed. The young woman from Iowa and seven other nurses became the first air stewardesses. At first pilots were unhappy because they did not want stewardesses on airplanes, but passengers loved the stewardesses. In 1940 there were around 1000 of them working for different airlines. The early \\"stewardesses\\" had to be under twenty-five-year-old, single and slim. When a woman joined an airline, she had to promise not to get married or have children. It was hard job and not well paid. They worked long hours and earned 1 an hour. In the 1970s, stewardesses were unhappy in their job and airlines had to make some changes. Since the 1970s, \\"stewardesses\\" have been called flight attendants. They are well paid and work fewer hours than in the past. Question: The main reason for Boeing Air Transport offering Ellen the job was _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"her nursing experience\\"?

Now more than ever, people are living with roommates to afford rent. Consider this option carefully, however; trying to find a roommate will split the cost of rent and utilities in half, but it can add a lot of stress as well. Consider a few key issues before searching for a roommate: Would you be comfortable sharing a room or an apartment? Are you expecting your roommate to be your best friend? Do you feel comfortable having someone around your personal belongings? How clean are you? Are you loud? How clean and loud would you want your roommate to be? Sharing a room with a brother, sister, or cousin is great training for life with a roommate. If you are close with one of your siblings, you may want to move out together. Make sure you trust one another to pay the bills on time. There are many ways to find roommates, whether it is through mutual friends or social media sites, but once you found someone who wants to live in the same area as you and is financially stable, talk to them in person. Some questions you should ask are: How clean are you? When do you go to bed, and how often do you have company? Do you have any pets, and will a significant other be living with you? Can you pay all bills on time? See if these questions influence your decision to live with the potential roommate. Your lifestyles should be mostly similar. Conflict is bound to happen when living with others. What matters is how you deal with it. Pretending to not be bothered by your roommate’s behavior will lead to frustration, but constant bickering is stressful. If you need to confront your roommate, choose your words carefully so your roommate does not feel attacked. “I feel frustrated when you don’t wash the dishes because the room smells” is better than “You’re a slob.” Focus on the behavior, not the person. Confront problems as they arise, not when you are frustrated and overwhelmed. If your roommate confronts you, remember that they are trying to improve your relationship. Listen and reflect on what your roommate tells you. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article discusses the increasing trend of people living with roommates to afford rent and provides guidance on choosing a suitable roommate and handling conflicts. It emphasizes the importance of considering personal preferences, cleanliness, lifestyle compatibility, and financial stability before selecting a roommate.

When a forest fire occurs, the resilience and adaptability of the forest ecosystem are put to the test. The immediate aftermath of the fire significantly alters the ecosystem's structure, leading to a series of consequences that affect all living organisms in the area. As mentioned in the question, the animals living in the burned area lose their hiding spots, which renders them more vulnerable to predators. Predators, in turn, are able to find prey more easily due to the scarcity of suitable hiding spots. Consequently, the rate of predation is likely to increase in the area, exacerbating the vulnerability of the prey population. Meanwhile, bird populations, which act as essential seed distributors and insect control agents, will often escape the affected area in search of a safer habitat. This can result in a decrease in the number of bird species, which could reduce the area's biodiversity and adversely impact the remaining ecosystem. The final step in this process is the reestablishment of the ecosystem in the affected area. After a forest fire, nature tends to recover and regrow in various ways, with the process typically occurring in several stages: 1. Primary colonizers: The first organisms to recolonize the burned area are usually hardy pioneer species like grasses, ferns, and wildflowers. These plants can grow rapidly, taking advantage of the newly available sunlight and nutrients that have been released into the soil by the fire. 2. Secondary succession: As the pioneer species grow and mature, they contribute to the recovery of the soil structure and fertility, paving the way for other plant species to take root. Over time, shrubs, saplings, and small trees start to emerge, gradually building up the forest's structure. Insects, herbivores, and decomposers re-enter the area, helping facilitate the growth of plant life and rejuvenating the ecosystem. 3. Mature ecosystems: Eventually, the forest will return to its pre-fire state, with mature trees dominating the landscape and providing habitat for various animal species. The components of the ecosystem will begin to play their respective roles again, leading to the restoration of the predator-prey relationships, nutrient cycling, and ecological processes that were disrupted by the fire. 4. Resilience and adaptation: As the ecosystem recovers, the different species present in the area might demonstrate resilience and adapt to the new conditions. For instance, some animal species might develop new strategies for avoiding predators due to their changed habitats, and predator populations might stabilize as the ratio of predators to prey reaches a new equilibrium. Moreover, some bird populations may return to the area, playing a vital role in reestablishing the ecological balance. In conclusion, the final step of the process described in the question is the reestablishment of the affected ecosystem after a forest fire, which can take years or even decades to achieve. Through successive stages and various ecological processes, the forest will gradually recover its structure, species composition, and ecological functions until it reaches a new equilibrium state where the predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and other vital processes can operate in harmony once again."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a context passage, an answer, and a question.

Sentence 2: The consistency principle is a very valuable problem-solving tool. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To evaluate the truth of Sentence 2 given the truth of Sentence 1, let us first break down the two sentences to understand the meaning and implications of the claims made. Sentence 1 claims two key attributes for the consistency principle: 1. Universal applicability: This means that, for any given problem or situation, a consistent solution can always be found by applying the consistency principle. 2. Universal unambiguity: This means that the consistency principle always leads to a unique consistent solution, ensuring that there is no confusion or ambiguity when applying this principle to reach a solution. Now, let's analyze Sentence 2, which claims that the consistency principle is a very valuable problem-solving tool. A good problem-solving tool would ideally possess the following qualities: 1. Applicability: A valuable problem-solving tool should be applicable to various situations or problems to be useful in different contexts. 2. Clarity and simplicity: An effective problem-solving tool should be easy to understand and apply, reducing confusion, complexity, or ambiguity in the process. 3. Effectiveness: A highly valuable problem-solving tool should help in finding a suitable solution efficiently and effectively. Considering the attributes of the consistency principle stated in Sentence 1, it becomes clear that this tool has broad applicability to numerous problems and ensures that the derived solution is unambiguous. Therefore, we can conclude that these two qualities of the consistency principle indeed contribute to it being a valuable problem-solving tool. However, Sentence 1 does not explicitly provide information about the clarity, simplicity, or effectiveness of the consistency principle. Whether the consistency principle is easy to understand and apply, or whether it leads to efficient problem solving remains outside the scope of Sentence 1. Assuming the truth of Sentence 1, we can only partially claim the truth of Sentence 2, since the first sentence only confirms the universal applicability and unambiguity of the consistency principle but does not provide information about other essential qualities that make a problem-solving tool valuable. Additionally, the term \\"very valuable\\" in Sentence 2 implies a high degree of importance and usefulness, but whether the consistency principle reaches that level based solely on its universal applicability and unambiguity cannot be concluded with certainty from the information provided. In summary, given the truth of Sentence 1, Sentence 2 could be considered partially true, since the consistency principle does possess some qualities of a valuable problem-solving tool. However, the degree of its value, as well as its effectiveness, remains undetermined based on the information provided."},{"instruction":"The war left significant legacies in all three countries. In the context of Japanese imperialism, the invasions are seen as the first Japanese attempt to become a global power. The partial occupation of Korea developed the Japanese concept that Korea belonged within Japan's sphere of influence, and the Japanese leaders of the late 19th and the early 20th centuries used the 1592-1597 invasions to reinforce the justification for their 20th century annexation of Korea. In China, the war was used politically to inspire nationalistic resistance against Japanese imperialism during the 20th century. In Chinese academia, historians list the war as one of the Wanli Emperor's \\"Three Great Punitive Campaigns\\". Contemporary Chinese historians often use the campaigns as an example of the friendship the two nations shared. In Korea, the war is a historic foundation of Korean nationalism and, as in China, inspired and was used politically to instigate nationalistic resistance against Japanese imperialism during the 20th century. Korea gained several national heroes during the conflict, such as Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

These changes have raised concerns among hundreds of British holidaymakers who now face an extra layer of challenges in accessing medical care. Reports of tourists being forced to pay hefty bills, or even before receiving treatment, call attention to the impact on British tourists travelling to popular resorts in Benidorm and Alicante. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the situation and discusses the implications for holidaymakers, healthcare providers, and tourist destinations. Hospitals in Tourist Resorts Install Payment Machines: In an effort to streamline the process of receiving payments, hospitals in tourist resorts have increasingly relied on machines for managing payments. These machines, designed to collect payments upfront, have created an additional barrier for tourists in need of medical services. As demand for healthcare services has grown among tourists, hospitals in heavily visited areas like Benidorm and Alicante have resorted to such measures, aiming to improve the efficiency of their operations and reduce waiting times for treatment. British Holidaymakers Forced to Pay for Care: The installation of payment machines in hospitals has had a direct impact on many British holidaymakers, as they must now confront the reality of paying for their healthcare services upfront. Hundreds of tourists have reported feeling forced to pay for care, even if they possess travel insurance. The absence of a streamlined method for payment reimbursement has led to frustration and confusion, with holidaymakers facing uncertainty over whether the costs incurred will be reimbursed by their insurance providers. Hefty Medical Bills Impacting Tourists: In addition to the difficulties associated with navigating payment machines, British holidaymakers are also encountering hefty medical bills during their trips. The costs of medical treatments in popular tourist resorts like Benidorm and Alicante are considerably higher than in the UK, and in many cases, payment is required prior to receiving care. For instance, the shocking case of a young boy impaled on a fence demonstrates the severity of the situation, as the boy’s family was asked to hand over cash before treatment could begin. This distressing incident highlights the financial burden that tourists may face while travelling on otherwise enjoyable holidays. The Implications and Potential Solutions: As healthcare providers in tourist resorts continue to implement payment machines, the potential consequences extend far beyond the British holidaymakers. First, tourists from across the world face similar challenges, and often, these healthcare costs discourage them from visiting certain destinations. As a result, local economies that rely on visitors to fuel their tourism industry may face financial ramifications. Moreover, the negative experiences facing these tourists may cast a shadow on their overall view of the destination, affecting word-of-mouth recommendations and social media postings. To mitigate these unintended consequences, local governments and healthcare providers must work together to find a balance that ensures accessible healthcare services and a streamlined payment process for all. Partnerships between travel insurance companies, healthcare providers, and the tourism industry can create solutions that benefit all parties involved, while simultaneously enhancing the image of tourist resorts as safe and caring destinations. Conclusion: The implementation of payment machines in hospitals in tourist resorts presents a complex challenge for British holidaymakers. The experiences of those forced to pay hefty medical bills upfront underscore the need for improved collaboration between healthcare providers, travel insurance companies, and local governments. By working together and prioritizing the needs of tourists, it is possible to create a system that offers accessible and affordable medical care while maintaining the efficiency needed in these high-demand destinations. As the situation continues to evolve, it is crucial to monitor the impact these changes will have on the tourist industry and the holidaymakers who rely on it for memorable and safe experiences."},{"instruction":"Data: Andra (singer), background, \\"solo singer\\"; Andra (singer), birthYear, 1986; Andra (singer), genre, Dance-pop; Andra (singer), birthPlace, Romania; Andra (singer), occupation, \\"singer, Reality television judge\\" Sentence about the following data:","output":"Andra, the Romanian solo singer, was born in 1986 and has an illustrious career in the Dance-pop genre.

Answer choices: - squids - humans - h2o - trout - octopus - insects - ducks - fish A:","output":"Webbed feet are specialized anatomical structures found in some animals, characterized by the presence of skin connecting their toes. This adaptation allows these animals to move more efficiently through water by creating a paddle-like effect, increasing the surface area and providing additional propulsion. From the answer choices provided, ducks are the most well-known animals that utilize webbed feet for moving faster through water. However, it's essential to understand the role of webbed feet in other animals as well. - Squids and octopuses: These creatures don’t have webbed feet. Instead, they rely on jet propulsion, utilizing specialized water-filled cavities and muscular contractions to propel themselves through water. - Humans: Humans don't have webbed feet naturally, but swimmers and divers sometimes wear swim fins or flippers that mimic the webbed feet function to enhance their water propulsion and swimming speed. - H2O: H2O refers to the chemical formula for water, which is a liquid substance that doesn't have anatomical structures such as webbed feet. - Trout and fish: While most fish don't have what could be considered webbed feet, they do have specialized fins that serve a similar purpose: allowing them to move with greater speed and agility through water. - Insects: Some aquatic insects, like water beetles and water striders, have evolved specialized structures on their legs that help them move quickly on the water's surface or swim efficiently. While not exactly webbed feet, these adaptations serve similar functions. In conclusion, ducks are the primary example of animals in the answer choices that use webbed feet for moving faster through water. However, the concept of webbed appendages for water mobility extends to other organisms such as specific fish species, insects, and humans wearing swim fins. This highlights that evolutionary adaptations for efficient movement through aquatic environments are diverse and can be seen in various species across the animal kingdom."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)?

The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.

Siwa Oasis, a Senussi stronghold, lies 160 mi south of Sollum on the edge of the sand sea and to the east are a string of oases, some close enough to the Nile Valley to be in range of Senussi raiders mounted on camels. A standard-gauge railway ran along the coast from Alexandria, intended to terminate at Sollum, which in 1915 had reached Dabaa, from which ran a track, known as the Khedival Motor Road, which was motorable in dry weather, although when hostilities began the wet season was imminent. The western frontier of Egypt had not been defined in 1914 because negotiations with the Ottomans had been interrupted by the Italo-Turkish War and then negated by the cession of Tripoli to Italy. A notional frontier ran south from Sollum, to the east of which was an area of 200,000 sq mi all desert south of the semi-desert coastal strip but with several oases, some quite big and supporting sizeable populations, administered by the Egyptian government. Bedouin lived a nomadic life between the oases, traded with the inhabitants and took refuge at them when wells ran dry. Question: How many miles broader is the Plateau than it is wide? Answer:","output":"To find the difference in breadth and width for the limestone plateau, we need to analyze the information given in the context. The plateau is mentioned to be about 50 miles wide at Dabaa and about 150 miles broad at Sollum. To determine how many miles broader it is, we subtract the smaller width (at Dabaa) from the larger breadth (Sollum): 150 miles (at Sollum) - 50 miles (at Dabaa) = 100 miles Therefore, the plateau is 100 miles broader at Sollum than it is wide at Dabaa."},{"instruction":"Question: Sasha published another book and it reached the best seller's list.

Question 2: What are the reasons for inflation? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing, as they both aim to understand the reasons behind inflation. In order to provide a comprehensive answer, let's discuss the topic in detail. Inflation, in general terms, is the rate at which the general price level of goods and services in an economy is increasing over time. In other words, it's the decline of purchasing power that a unit of currency experiences over a specified period. It's usually measured as a percentage, with the most common measure being the Consumer Price Index (CPI). There are several factors that can contribute to inflation, and the reasons for inflation can generally be grouped into two main categories: Demand-pull inflation and Cost-push inflation. 1. Demand-pull Inflation: Demand-pull inflation occurs when there is an increase in the overall demand for goods and services in an economy, surpassing the available supply. This increased demand outstripping the available supply leads to scarcity and higher prices, resulting in inflation. The main reasons for demand-pull inflation are: a. Increase in Money Supply: An increase in the money supply results in more money being available for spending, increasing consumer spending and business investment. This can create an excess demand for goods and services, leading to higher prices and demand-pull inflation. b. Higher Disposable Income: An increase in the disposable income of consumers (ex. due to lower tax rates or increased wages) can result in higher spending and demand for goods and services, leading to inflation. c. Fiscal Policies: Government policies such as increased government spending and tax cuts can boost demand in the economy, causing demand-pull inflation. d. Increase in Export Demand: If there is a significant increase in demand for a country's products from foreign countries, the domestic demand for goods and services may rise, causing inflation. 2. Cost-push Inflation: Cost-push inflation occurs when production costs rise, leading firms to pass these increased costs onto consumers, causing the overall price level to rise. The main reasons for cost-push inflation are: a. Rising Wages: Higher wages for workers can lead to increased production costs for firms, causing them to raise their prices and, ultimately, result in inflation. b. Rising Cost of Raw Materials: An increase in the cost of raw materials, such as oil, metals, or agricultural products, can lead to firms passing on those increased costs to consumers in the form of higher prices. c. Currency Depreciation: A weaker currency can make imported goods and raw materials more expensive in terms of the local currency, leading to higher production costs for firms. These higher costs are subsequently passed on to consumers, causing inflation. d. Supply Shocks: An unexpected event that disrupts the supply chain or production of goods can lead to scarcity and higher prices, causing cost-push inflation. Examples include natural disasters, political instability, or worker strikes. In conclusion, both questions are asking about the factors that contribute to inflation in an economy. There are two main categories of inflation: demand-pull inflation, which occurs when there is an increase in overall demand for goods and services, and cost-push inflation, which occurs when production costs rise and businesses pass those higher costs onto consumers."},{"instruction":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Arbina was born while Theodore Roosevelt was living in the White House.

Question: suppose there is another tray free happens, how will it affect a GREATER spread of the virus. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"Suppose there is another \\"tray free\\" event happening simultaneously, we must first understand what that event implies. Let us assume that this \\"tray free\\" incident refers to an external factor that could potentially influence the spread of the virus. In this case, it could refer to various environmental or social situations such as increased social interaction, weakened immune system due to another infection or circumstance, or climatic factors that affect the rate of transmission. To analyze the impact of this \\"tray free\\" event on the GREATER spread of the virus and its influence on the second effect, which refers to the virus having receptors that lock onto a target cell, we have to break down the scenario into three possible outcomes: more effect, less effect, or no effect. 1. More Effect: If the supposed perturbation increases the spread of the virus, multiple factors may be at play. For instance, the \\"tray free\\" event could lead to increased social interaction, creating more opportunities for the virus to spread from person to person. Additionally, the event could lead to an increase in the virus's ability to lock onto target cells due to changes in the host's immune system or changes in the virus's receptors. This improvement in the virus's targeting mechanism could result in a more effective invasion of the host cells and allow it to accelerate its reproduction, leading to a higher rate of infection and ultimately a faster spread. 2. Less Effect: Conversely, the \\"tray free\\" event could be responsible for reducing the overall impact of the second effect. This decrease in the virus's ability to invade cells could stem from an immune system response that effectively recognizes and neutralizes the invading virus before it can enter the cells. Moreover, this perturbation could tamper with the virus's receptors, making it harder for the virus to lock onto a suitable target cell. This could lead to weaker infections and slower transmission of the virus among the host population. 3. No Effect: Under certain circumstances, the \\"tray free\\" event may have little or no effect on the virus's ability to lock onto target cells and achieve a greater spread. This situation could arise if the event does not substantially impact the host's immune system, the virus's structural features, or the environmental conditions affecting the transmission of the virus. The \\"tray free\\" event itself may be neutral in terms of its influence on the overall viral spread. In conclusion, whether the \\"tray free\\" event leads to a more significant, less significant, or no effect on the spread of the virus depends on the nature of the event itself and how it interacts with the host, the virus, and the environment. It is crucial to understand the underlying factors and mechanisms at play when evaluating the impact of such an event on the virus's spread and its ability to lock onto target cells."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are given a question-answer pair.

Wilson and Theodore X. Barber first identified FPP in 1981, said to apply to about 4% of the population. Besides identifying this trait, Wilson and Barber reported a number of childhood antecedents that likely laid the foundation for fantasy proneness in later life, such as, \`\`a parent, grandparent, teacher, or friend who encouraged the reading of fairy tales, reinforced the child's ... fantasies, and treated the child's dolls and stuffed animals in ways that encouraged the child to believe that they were alive.'' They suggested that this trait was almost synonymous with those who responded dramatically to hypnotic induction, that is, \`\`high hypnotizables.'' The first systematic studies were conducted in the 1980s by psychologists Judith Rhue and Steven Jay Lynn. Later research in the 1990s by Deirdre Barrett at Harvard confirmed most of these characteristics of fantasy prone people, but she also identified another set of highly hypnotizable subjects who had had traumatic childhoods and who identified fantasy time mainly by \`\`spacing out.'' Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: is it normal to live in a fantasy world?","output":"Based on the information provided, living in a fantasy world may not be considered \\"normal\\" for the majority of the population. However, it may be considered normal for individuals who are considered fantasy prone, as identified by psychologists Sheryl C. Wilson and Theodore X. Barber. This trait is estimated to apply to about 4% of the population. Fantasy prone individuals often have a childhood history of encouragement and reinforcement of their fantasies by influential figures in their lives. Furthermore, it is important to note the connection between fantasy proneness and high hypnotizability, as suggested by the researchers. Later studies by Judith Rhue, Steven Jay Lynn, and Deirdre Barrett also identified subsets of highly hypnotizable subjects with traumatic childhoods who had a propensity to \\"space out\\" and engage in fantasies. In summary, while living in a fantasy world might not be considered normal for the majority of people, it can be a typical trait for certain individuals who have specific psychological characteristics and backgrounds."},{"instruction":"Сумчатая мышь Годмана Translate to English","output":"Godman's Pouched Mouse Godman's Pouched Mouse, also known as Heteromys anomalus or \\"Сумчатая мышь Годмана\\" in Russian, is a small, nocturnal rodent species that belongs to the family Heteromyidae. It can be found in several countries in the Americas, including Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama. This species was named after British zoologist Frederick DuCane Godman, who made significant contributions to the science of zoology, particularly the study of birds and mammals. The Godman's Pouched Mouse is primarily characterized by its unique, fur-lined cheek pouches, which are used by the animal to carry food back to its nest. These pouches are located on the sides of the head, and they can be turned inside-out for cleaning purposes. The animal has a grayish to reddish-brown coat, with a white or pale coloring on its underparts. It also has a long, bushy tail, which is a feature often associated with members of the Heteromyidae family. In terms of habitat, the Godman's Pouched Mouse is known to inhabit a variety of ecosystems, ranging from tropical forests to dry shrublands. It is well-adapted to arboreal living, relying on its sharp claws and prehensile tail to help climb trees and navigate through dense vegetation. Its arboreal lifestyle also allows it to avoid predators more effectively. The diet of the Godman's Pouched Mouse mainly consists of plant matter, such as seeds, fruits, and leaves. However, it is also known to consume insects and other small invertebrates for additional protein and nutrients. This omnivorous diet is essential for the animal to maintain its energy levels and well-being, considering its nocturnal and active lifestyle. When it comes to reproduction, the Godman's Pouched Mouse is a solitary animal that comes together with a partner only for breeding purposes. The female gives birth to a small litter of around 1-4 offspring after a gestation period of approximately 4-5 weeks. The young are born in a nest made of leaves and grass, and the mother cares for them until they are weaned and independent enough to venture out on their own. As of now, the Godman's Pouched Mouse is classified as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This means that it is not currently under significant threat of extinction, and its populations are relatively stable. However, like many other species, it faces potential threats due to habitat loss and degradation, as well as predation by invasive species. To ensure the long-term survival of the Godman's Pouched Mouse, it is essential to continue monitoring its population trends and implementing conservation measures when needed."},{"instruction":"Here is some data about a restaurant: name = Wildwood, eatType = coffee shop, food = Japanese, priceRange = high, customer rating = 3 out of 5, near = Ranch.

The 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, also known as 'The Dismissal,' was a political deadlock that occurred when the Senate, controlled by the opposition Liberal-Country Party Coalition led by Malcolm Fraser, refused to pass the budget bills proposed by the ruling Labor government led by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. The opposition demanded that Whitlam call for a new election as they believed his government was incompetent, particularly following the controversial 1974–75 Loans Affair. The deadlock persisted, and the government struggled to maintain essential services and payments without the necessary budgetary bills passed by the Senate. As the impasse wore on, the Governor-General Sir John Kerr intervened to resolve the crisis. The 1975 constitutional crisis deadlock ultimately ended on November 11, 1975. On that day, the Governor-General took the unprecedented step of dismissing Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, dissolving the Parliament, and appointing Malcolm Fraser as caretaker Prime Minister. This led to a general election on December 13, 1975, in which the Liberal-Country Party Coalition emerged victorious, and Malcolm Fraser became the Prime Minister of Australia. In summary, the deadlock of the 1975 constitutional crisis came to an end on November 11, 1975, when Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister, dissolved the Parliament, and appointed Malcolm Fraser as caretaker Prime Minister."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Holidays are really important. Many of us will have childhood memories of summer holidays where we were taken away from home to experience new environments and learn in different ways. But holidays are expensive and, for those on low wages or living on benefits, they are often unobtainable. Even the cheapest holidays require travel and other additional costs that are difficult for many families to meet. For working parents, the long summer break can be a very difficult problem for childcare. When an annual leave allowance amounts to only five weeks, there is a need to spread this across the year. Couples can find themselves taking leave in turn in order to care for children who are on holiday. For some this makes even an affordable family holiday difficult. The schools that I visit in Nottingham are full of experienced staff committed to giving our children a caring and inspiring learning environment. The number of children receiving free school meals is quite large in Nottingham and many schools have breakfast clubs to make sure that children get a healthy start to the day. Most schools undertake programs of group or individual educational support. Schools also have an important role in safeguarding children's welfare through the ongoing touch and support with their pupils. During the long summer holidays, much of this is missed. While teachers are holidaying in the UK, many of their pupils spend the whole six weeks on the street where they live. The lack of free school meals for six weeks can result in pressure on a family budget and an inability to afford the inspiring experiences that help children to continue their learning. In setting out its plans for a five-term year, Nottingham City Council is seeking to reduce the summer holiday down to four and a half weeks, with a more balanced five terms of roughly eight weeks, each followed by a two-week break.

It identifies a specific person, and differentiates that person from other members of a group, such as a family or clan, with whom that person shares a common surname. The term \\"given name\\" refers to the fact that the name usually is \\"bestowed\\" upon a person, normally \\"given\\" to a child by its parents at or near the time of birth. This contrasts with a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name), which is normally inherited, and shared with other members of the child's immediate family. - Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) standard and published as \\"The Unicode Standard\\", the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 128,000 characters covering 135 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). , the most recent version is \\"Unicode 9.0\\". The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium. - A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek \\"sýn\\" (\\"with\\") and \\"ónoma\\" (\\"name\\"). An example of synonyms are the words \\"begin\\", \\"start\\", \\"commence\\", \\"initiate\\", \\"fun\\", \\"pleasing\\" . Words can be synonymous when meant in certain senses, even if they are not synonymous in all of their senses. For example, if one talks about a \\"long time\\" or an \\"extended time\\", \\"long\\" and \\"extended\\" are synonymous within that context. Synonyms with exact meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. Some academics call the former type cognitive synonyms to distinguish them from the latter type, which they call near-synonyms. - A surname or family name is a name added to a given name. In many cases, a surname is a family name and many dictionaries define \\"surname\\" as a synonym of \\"family name\\". In the Western Hemisphere, it is commonly synonymous with last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's given name there. - In the German alphabet, the (traditionally lowercase-only) letter ß, called Eszett or scharfes S, in English \\"sharp S\\", is a consonant that evolved as a ligature of \\"long s and z\\" (z) and \\"long s over round s\\" (s). It is pronounced (see IPA). Since the German orthography reform of 1996, it is used only after long vowels and diphthongs while \\"ss\\" is written after short vowels. The name \\"Eszett\\" comes from the two letters S and Z as they are pronounced in German. Its Unicode encoding is U+00DF. - The long, medial, or descending s () is a form of the minuscule (lower-case) letter \\"s\\", which was formerly used where \\"s\\" occurred in the middle or at the beginning of a word (e.g. \\"infulnes\\" for \\"sinfulness\\" and \\"uccesful\\" for \\"successful\\"). The modern letterform was called the \\"terminal\\", \\"round\\", or \\"short\\" s. - The German orthography reform of 1996 (\\"\\") was a change to German spelling and punctuation that was intended to simplify German orthography and thus to make it easier to learn, without substantially changing the rules familiar to users of the language. - Strauss , Strauß or Straus is a common Germanic surname . Outside Germany and Austria Strauß is always spelled Strauss ( the letter \`\` ß '' is not used in the German - speaking part of Switzerland ) . The families using the Strauss name represent a genetically varied group of people of both Jewish and Germanic origin . The name has been used by families in the Germanic area for at least a thousand years . The overlord of Gröna for example , went by the name of Struz and used the image of an ostrich as his symbol . Examples of it could still be seen on the thousand - year - old church bell of that town . \`\` Struz '' or \`\` Strutz '' is the North - German form of the word \`\` Strauss '' , which is the modern German word for an \`\` Ostrich '' . Some of the earliest Jewish bearers of the name hailed from the Judengasse in medieval Frankfurt , where families have been known by the name of the houses they inhabited . All the houses had names and these included Haus Strauss , complete with an image of an ostrich on the façade . When , for tax purposes , Napoleon made surnames obligatory in 1808 , some more Jewish families decided to adopt the Straus ( s ) name . - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere. - A diphthong (or ; from Greek: , \\"diphthongos\\", literally \\"two sounds\\" or \\"two tones\\"), also known as a gliding vowel, is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets: that is, the tongue (and/or other parts of the speech apparatus) moves during the pronunciation of the vowel. In many dialects of English, the phrase \\"no highway cowboys\\" has five distinct diphthongs, one in every syllable. - In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are , pronounced with the lips pronounced with the front of the tongue pronounced with the back of the tongue pronounced in the throat; and , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and and , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals). Contrasting with consonants are vowels. - An orthography is a set of conventions for writing a language. It includes norms of spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, and punctuation. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'is a list of' with 'person'. Answer:","output":"An alphabet has the relation 'is a list of' with 'person'.

Two years earlier in 2004, Alex Wyler (Reeves), an architect, arrives at the lake house and finds Kate's letter in the mailbox. The house is neglected, with no sign of paw prints anywhere. During the house's restoration, a dog runs through Alex's paint and leaves fresh paw prints right where Kate said they would be. Baffled, Alex writes back, asking how Kate knew about the paw prints since the house was unoccupied until he arrived. On Valentine's Day 2006, Kate witnesses a traffic accident near Daley Plaza and tries to save the male victim, unsuccessfully. She impulsively drives back to the lake house, finds Alex's letter and writes back.

Make this proper case","output":"To learn Tai Chi Chuan, you must be conscious of yourself both physically and mentally. This ancient Chinese martial art, also known as \\"supreme ultimate fist,\\" not only focuses on self-defense techniques but also on cultivating the individual's overall well-being. First and foremost, understand the philosophy behind Tai Chi Chuan, which is largely influenced by the concept of Yin and Yang. The balance of these opposing forces promotes harmony and health, both crucial aspects of Tai Chi practice. To begin learning this powerful art, follow these crucial steps: 1. Find a qualified instructor: A competent teacher with suitable experience in Tai Chi Chuan will ensure you learn the proper techniques and methods. They can also give you individual attention, correct your errors, and guide you towards progress and improvement. 2. Develop patience and dedication: Learning Tai Chi Chuan takes time, and it is essential to invest yourself in consistent practice. You must be patient and dedicated to truly experience its benefits. 3. Learn the basic stances and movements: Start with learning foundation exercises such as standing meditation (Zhan Zhuang), which helps with balance and body awareness. Gradually move on to basic stances, like horse stance and bow stance, and learn fundamental movements to build a solid foundation. 4. Practice forms and sequences: Tai Chi Chuan consists of several forms, which are a set of movements practiced in a particular sequence. As you become comfortable with the basic movements, progress towards learning and practicing these forms. 5. Incorporate breathing techniques: Proper breathing is crucial in Tai Chi Chuan. Learn to inhale and exhale slowly and synchronously with your movements. This will help you maintain focus, enhance your movements' effectiveness and develop your inner energy, known as \\"Qi.\\" 6. Engage in partner exercises: As you move forward in your Tai Chi journey, participate in partner exercises that teach you how to assess, redirect, and manipulate an opponent's energy and movements. 7. Cultivate mindfulness and self-awareness: Proper Tai Chi practice requires a heightened level of mindfulness and self-awareness. Develop these by concentrating on your movements, remaining grounded and present, meditating, and channeling your internal energy throughout your body. 8. Embrace relaxation and balance: Learn to relax your body and mind while practicing Tai Chi Chuan to optimize your performance. Focusing on balance, coordination, and flexibility is equally integral to the art's mastery. 9.

Alongside attending classes and practicing with determination, make efforts to support your journey by adhering to a healthy lifestyle, maintaining a positive outlook, and seeking knowledge to refine your skills. As your practice deepens, you will experience improved physical health, mental clarity, and spiritual growth, culminating in a well-rounded, harmonious lifestyle."},{"instruction":"Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What later came to be used as a hospital?, using the article: The Domesday Survey of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, it is thought that St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was \\"one of the finest great houses in the North West\\" of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.According to popular tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of the manor in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758.

It served as the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family and was considered one of the finest great houses in the North West during the 14th century. Though the article does not specifically mention the conversion of Ashton Old Hall into a hospital, it is not uncommon for historical buildings, such as manor houses, to be repurposed for different uses over time, including serving as hospitals.

Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect modernism or other recent styles. Public monuments representing collective memorials to particular groups of dead people continue to be erected, especially war memorials, and in the Western world have now replaced individual or family memorials as the dominant types of very large memorials; Western political leaders now usually receive simple graves. Some large memorials are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and several Holocaust memorials, such as Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Vel d'Hiv Memorial in Paris (1994), the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin (2004), and the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate. Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated Neue Wache in Berlin and the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which is internationally controversial.Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, at least on the Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.Many large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including Lenin's Mausoleum and those for Atatürk, Jinnah, Kim Il-Sung, Che Guevara and several Presidential...

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump... Question: How long was the publicity campaign for Comey's book?

Title: The Simple-Minded Murder Movie plot: The story takes place in 1930's SkÃ¥ne, Sweden, and focuses on Sven, who is hare-lipped and thus can't speak correctly. Most people consider him stupid, and call him an idiot. The film begins with Sven and a woman, who we later learn is called Anna, driving an old car across the landscape. The sun is setting, and in the sky Sven sees three angels. He and Anna hide in an old house, and while Anna makes herself comfortable, Sven throws a huge, bloodstained blade into a well. He lies down beside Anna and starts his inner monologue about how it all began. When Sven's mother died, he was \\"taken care of\\" by HÃ¶glund (Hans Alfredsson), an evil factory owner who is a member of the local Nazi party, and lives on a farm. Sven must work on HÃ¶glund's farm without pay, and sleep among cows in the stables, where he is tormented by a rat. Being very goodhearted, Sven cannot make himself drown the animal once he has caught it, because he simply can't take another life. Having read the Bible, a gift from his sister, Sven imagines he is visited by three angels from time to time, whom he speaks to in a clear voice, making it clear that this dialog takes place in his own mind. One day he mets the wheelchair-bound Anna (Maria Johansson), whom he falls in love with, and having been mistreated at HÃ¶glund's, Sven escapes to Anna's family, who gladly take him in. At Anna's house, Sven is finally treated as an adult.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process, wherein certain substances rise into the high atmosphere and eventually lead to the formation of acidic rain, can be thought of as the release and dispersion of these substances, primarily in the form of air pollutants. Emissions from various anthropogenic and natural sources contribute to the accumulation of these substances in the atmosphere. There are several ways through which these substances can be released into the atmosphere. The primary contributors are anthropogenic sources, which include industrial processes, power generation, vehicles, and other human activities responsible for emitting large amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These pollutants are the main precursors for the formation of acid rain. Industrial processes, power generation, and vehicles, for example, burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gasoline. During the combustion process, sulfur and nitrogen present in these fuels combine with oxygen, forming SO2 and NOx emissions that disperse into the atmosphere. In addition, several industrial processes, such as the production of sulfuric acid and the smelting of metal ores, are known to release SO2 directly into the atmosphere. Natural sources also contribute to the release of these substances into the atmosphere, although to a lesser extent compared to human activities. These sources include volcanic eruptions, which release sulfur compounds and other gases, and lightning storms producing nitrogen oxides. Moreover, bacterial processes occurring in soils and water bodies result in the emission of sulfur compounds and nitrogen-containing substances such as ammonia into the atmosphere. Once released, these substances, including SO2 and NOx, undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere, interacting with water vapor and oxygen. These reactions lead to the formation of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), which are then carried by clouds and air currents. Subsequently, these acidic compounds are deposited onto the Earth's surface in the form of precipitation (rain, snow, fog, or even dry deposition), contributing to the phenomenon known as acid rain. In summary, the first step of the process that ultimately leads to the formation of acid rain is the release and dispersion of the contributing substances, primarily in the form of air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, into the atmosphere. This occurs through both anthropogenic and natural sources, with human activities playing a significant role in exacerbating the problem."},{"instruction":"What is the answer: The son-in-law of a British Prime Minister and the father of a former Minister of Defence, which Conservative politician served as the last Governor of Southern Rhodesia?","output":"To find the answer to this question, we will follow these steps: 1.

Step by step answer:","output":"The two sentences provided describe different scenarios, so stating that they are the same is not true. Let's break down each sentence step by step to explain the differences: 1. Sentence 1: \\"Six people pose together for a picture on the subway.\\" - Number of people: Six - Activity: Posing for a picture together - Location: On the subway - Purpose: Not specified (could be for any reason) 2. Sentence 2: \\"A break dance crew pose for a newspaper picture.\\" - Number of people: Not specified (could be any number within a dance crew) - Activity: Posing for a picture - Location: Not specified (could be anywhere) - Purpose: For a newspaper picture Here's a comparison of each aspect mentioned in the sentences: 1. Number of people: - Sentence 1 talks about six individuals. - Sentence 2 does not specify the number of people in the break dance crew. 2. Activity: - In both sentences, the subjects are posing for a picture. 3. Location: - Sentence 1 specifies that the picture is taken in a subway. - Sentence 2 does not specify the location. 4. Purpose: - Sentence 1 does not specify the purpose of taking the picture. - Sentence 2 states that the picture is taken for a newspaper. Since there are significant differences in the number of people, location, and purpose, it is not accurate to say that the scenario described in Sentence 1 (\\"Six people pose together for a picture on the subway\\") is the same as the scenario described in Sentence 2 (\\"A break dance crew pose for a newspaper picture.\\")."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: - instrument is vocals , guitar , piano , ukulele - alt is baez top at microphone , playing guitar , in sleeveless - years active is 1958 -- present - caption is baez performing in 1973 - birth name is joan chandos báez - origin is staten island , new york city , united states - label is vanguard -lrb- 1972 -- 1977 -rrb- portrait/cbs -lrb- 1977 -- 1981 -lrb- -rrb- gold castle -lrb- 1987 -- 1991 -rrb- virgin -lrb- 1960 1991 -- 1993 -rrb- guardian -lrb- 1995 -- 2002 -rrb- -- koch -lrb- 2003 -- present -rrb- 1971 -rrb- a & m - genre is folk , folk rock , country , gospel - birth date is 9 january 1941 - image size is 280 - background is solo_singer - image is file : joan baez hamburg 1973 281173000 5.jpg - associated acts is jackson , donovan , bob dylan , steve earle , mimi browne fariña , the grateful dead , janis ian , the , indigo girls , ennio morricone , odetta , pete seeger mary , paul simon , dar williams chapin carpenter , judy collins - occupation is musician , songwriter , activist Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

'' \`\` raul . '' she laughed again , trying to remember if she had ever read a romance book in which the hero 's name was","output":"\\"Raul.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is discussing their taste in literature and how it is broad but not broad enough to encompass certain types of books, specifically romance novels. The speaker shares a personal anecdote about having a girlfriend who enjoyed reading romance books featuring male protagonists with names like \\"Colt\\" or \\"Raul.\\" The repetition of \\"Raul\\" adds a touch of humor to the conversation, as the speaker and the listener share a laugh about the clichéd nature of naming conventions in romance novels. Romance novels, as a genre, tend to follow a set of tried-and-true rules and conventions. These include the use of certain character archetypes, naming conventions, settings, and conflicts. The speaker in the sentence points out the recurring pattern of names such as \\"Colt\\" or \\"Raul\\" as typical examples of the male protagonists often found in these types of novels. The names \\"Colt\\" and \\"Raul\\" evoke specific images and associations in the readers' minds. \\"Colt,\\" for instance, is a strong name, reminiscent of a young, wild horse, untamed and powerful. It suggests a character with a strong, independent spirit, passion, and a sense of adventure – qualities that are typically desirable in a romantic hero. Similarly, \\"Raul\\" conveys exoticism, strength, and sensuality – the name itself rolls off the tongue with an alluring, mysterious air. These names set the stage for the readers' expectations for the characters and their respective journeys. It is evident that the speaker finds these naming conventions somewhat amusing and indicative of the predictable nature of romantic fiction. They imply that the genre might rely too heavily on such clichés, making it difficult for them to appreciate the books beyond their surface elements. This suggests not only that the speaker's taste in literature is broad, but that they crave depth and variety in the literary works they engage with. Sharing the memory of the girlfriend who enjoyed reading romance novels, the speaker hints at the different reading preferences that people may have. While the speaker is not inclined to embrace romantic fiction, they acknowledge and respect their former girlfriend's taste in literature. This demonstrates an understanding of diverse preferences and the fact that reading is a deeply personal and subjective experience, shaped by individual preferences, interests, and backgrounds. As the conversation continues, the speaker and the listener share a laugh while trying to recall if they had ever encountered a romance book featuring a hero with the name \\"Raul.\\" This light-hearted banter showcases the connection they share, as well as their joint amusement at the clichéd nature of the genre. Through discussing their taste in literature, the speaker and the listener connect on a relatable level, bonding over their shared curiosity about the conventions of romance novels and the ubiquitous use of names like \\"Colt\\" and \\"Raul.\\""},{"instruction":"What is the most logical next event?

The presence of a busy event with people behind a railing suggests that the area in question has a considerable level of activity and a large number of people attending. This type of setting is typically found in locations where police presence is important to maintain public safety, provide crowd control and deter criminal activities. Furthermore, the people behind the railing indicate that there might be certain designated areas for the crowd, and police officers are likely responsible for ensuring that attendees adhere to the established boundaries. This is a common practice during busy public events, such as parades, concerts, or street festivals, which indeed require increased law enforcement presence for the safety and well-being of all participants. In addition, police officers performing duties in such environments usually adhere to particular schedules and routines that involve regular patrolling of the area. This is crucial to maintain an effective law enforcement presence, as officers can quickly respond to any emergencies or issues while ensuring they are visible to the public. Therefore, taking into account the police officer's mode of transportation (a motorcycle), the busy event, people behind the railing, and the general role of law enforcement in such circumstances, it is logical to conclude that this scenario describes a police officer patrolling a busy area."},{"instruction":"Fact 1: If an organism becomes too hot then that organism may die.

David's house has 64 windows. How many minutes will it take David to wash all of the windows? Let's be accurate as possible.","output":"To find out how many minutes it will take David to wash all 64 windows, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Determine David's window-washing rate. David washes 4 windows in 10 minutes, so his window-washing rate can be calculated as: 4 windows / 10 minutes = 2/5 windows per minute Step 2: Determine the number of minutes needed to wash all 64 windows. Now that we know David washes 2/5 of a window per minute, we can determine how many minutes it takes him to wash all 64 windows. To do this, we can set up a proportion: (window-washing rate × time) = number of windows (2/5 windows/minute × time) = 64 windows To solve for time, we'll divide 64 windows by 2/5 windows/minute: time = 64 windows / (2/5 windows/minute) To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by the reciprocal: time = 64 windows × (5/2 minutes/window) Multiplying, we find: time = 160/2 minutes time = 80 minutes So, it would take David 80 minutes to wash all of the windows in his house."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Question: What kind of animal is Amy?

Because of the size of the towers, the section of the façade between them may appear narrow and compressed. The eastern end follows the French form. The distinctive character of the interior of German Gothic cathedrals is their breadth and openness. This is the case even when, as at Cologne, they have been modelled upon a French cathedral.

The given tweet or plurk post - \\"asks anyone still up?\\" is rather difficult to ascribe any definitive sentiment to, because it is more of a query or a neutral expression. With the available information, it can be perceived as neutral sentiment as it does not express any form of emotion, either positive or negative. However, the sentiment could also depend on the context in which the message is written that is not provided in this standalone message. For instance, if the author is seeking company because they feel lonely or anxious, this might have a slightly negative sentiment. On the other hand, if the author is excited and wants to share some good news or interesting thoughts, it may imply a slightly positive sentiment. Moreover, sentiment analysis can also include assessing the level of subjectivity or objectivity in a text. In this case, the message is quite objective as it represents a direct question and does not contain any personal beliefs, emotions, or opinions.

Yes or no? Answer: Tennessee was the last state to leave the Union and join the Confederacy at the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War in 1861, and the first state to be readmitted to the Union at the end of the war. Question: how tennessee became a state Answer:","output":"Tennessee's journey to statehood began well before its official admission to the Union on June 1, 1796. The region was initially inhabited by various Native American tribes, and European explorers, settlers, and traders began to make their way to the area in the mid-16th century. By the mid-18th century, the Cherokee and the Chickasaw tribes were the most prominent Native American groups in the region. The first permanent European settlements were established by the English in the 1760s and 1770s. Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina's western territory, which was known as the \\"Territory South of the River Ohio.\\" In 1784, a few years after the American Revolutionary War, settlers in eastern Tennessee declared the territory as the \\"State of Franklin.\\" However, the bid to become an independent state lacked sufficient support and was eventually dissolved in 1789. In 1790, North Carolina ceded its western territory to the federal government, which then organized it into the Southwest Territory. President George Washington appointed William Blount as the territorial governor, who played a crucial role in preparing the region for statehood. The territory quickly experienced an influx of settlers, and by 1795, it had reached the minimum population requirement of 60,000 to be considered for statehood. The process of officially becoming a state began with a constitutional convention held in Knoxville in January 1796. The convention represented various regions of the territory and comprised 55 delegates who drafted and adopted Tennessee's first state constitution. On February 6, 1796, the delegates completed the drafted constitution, which was then submitted to President Washington and Congress for review. The constitution provided for a bicameral legislature, a governor with limited powers, and a judiciary system. On June 1, 1796, President Washington signed a bill admitting Tennessee as the 16th state of the United States. Tennessee's involvement in the U.S. Civil War came much later in its history. As a southern state with a predominantly agricultural-based economy and a large enslaved population, Tennessee was bound to have divided loyalties during the Civil War. While many citizens supported secession, there were also Unionist pockets, particularly in East Tennessee. Nonetheless, on June 8, 1861, the citizens of Tennessee voted in favor of joining the Confederacy, becoming the last state to do so. The state experienced heavy wartime devastation and was the site of numerous key battles. Towards the end of the war, on July 24, 1866, Tennessee became the first Confederate state to be readmitted to the Union after meeting the requirements for reconstruction. In summary, Tennessee became a state through a series of territorial acquisitions, population growth, and constitutional conventions that led to its admission to the Union in 1796. Its relationship with the federal government during the U.S. Civil War marked a tumultuous period in its history, but the state's readmission to the Union in 1866 signified its commitment to move forward and rebuild."},{"instruction":"Santa Ana winds wreak havoc across Southern California Pasadena — Ricardo Muñoz, left, and Agustin Muñoz, in tree work to remove a tree that fell into the backyard of a home.

I'm wasn't a patient there and they got me in the day-of for an emergency appointment because my tooth cracked and my insurance was up the next day.

UPDATED:. 09:15 EST, 21 March 2013. It sounds like a scene from an episode of the popular and long-running cartoon The Simpsons. A defendant called Bart Simpson, appearing in court in front of a judge called Mr Burns. However, this isn't a fictional case but a real-life trial which took place at Warwick Crown Court this week. Bizarre: A defendant called Bart Simpson, appearing in court in front of a judge called Mr Burns at Warwick Crown Court. Company Director Barton Simpson, 56, stood trial in front of Mr Recorder Burns at Warwick Crown Court on Monday. He was spared jail after admitting that he carried a .38 Smith and Wesson revolver in his luggage while catching a flight at Birmingham airport in May last year. Mr Burns sentenced Simpson to a 12-month community order with 140 hours of unpaid work and ordered him to pay £800 costs. The defendant was flying to Croatia when he put his bag through an X-ray machine which detected the weapon. He told police the gun, which he inherited from his father, was a 'curio' and that he had forgotten it was in his holdall. Stars: Bart Simpson and Mr Burns are long-running characters in The Simpsons. Andrew Wilkins, prosecuting, said. Simpson normally kept the revolver at his home in Eccleshall,. Staffordshire and realised his mistake almost immediately. 'He put his hands to his face and hesitated before he then went through the personal metal detector,' the lawyer said. 'The reason he said he had it with. him, and there is no reason to disagree, was that he was having work. done on his flat while he was travelling and did not want it to come. into the hands of the decorator.' Mr Wilkins said Simpson had intended. to leave the gun locked in his car, but he was distracted because of. circumstances including the deaths of a friend and of his son, a serving. soldier. Mr Burns told Simpson: 'It was a very stupid thing you did. You must be punished for it, but I think you can be dealt with by way of a community order.' A court worker said: 'It's a bizarre. coincidence that Bart Simpson is actually on trial in front of Mr Burns. but it'll proceed as any other criminal case would. 'There were some eyebrows raised when the court list was published.' The fictional Bart Simpson is the main character in the popular, long-running animated television series The Simpsons. He is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge. Charles Montgomery 'Monty' Burns, often referred to as Mr Burns, is the evil owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He is the boss of Bart's father Homer. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

The water cooler has become the symbol for communicating office gossip, and steering clear of it can prevent you from getting embroiled in the politics you are trying to avoid. Opt for water breaks when the cooler isn’t surrounded, or for breaks when the break room is empty. To further fortify your avoidance of politics, be strict about who you take breaks with in general, limiting your lunches to trusted coworkers. If you do your research before you get started on a project, you can avoid crossing boundaries into interpersonal issues. For example, if you are assigned to a project without asking any questions and you encounter a problem a couple of days later, you can upset the office equilibrium if you ask the wrong coworker for help. Get all your instructions from the get-go. Ask lots of questions when you get a project. Even go so far as to ask the boss or supervisor for a meeting so that you can ensure that you aren’t impinging on their work time. Ask the person who assigned you project who they prefer you ask questions of before starting the project. This can minimize offense if you go to someone your boss doesn’t like. In order to stay out of office disputes and politics, you have to not care what they think. Getting in the mix and defending yourself can just add fuel to the gossip fire, not to mention create a reputation for yourself of being a time waster. Recognize that work isn’t about who is most well-liked, like it was in high school. Coworkers who form cliques are bad examples, so stay away from them. Instead of worrying about what coworkers like you, focus on doing a good job. If you’re looking for a promotion, the best way to ensure one is to perform high-quality work. A diligent worker does not need to degrade others or pit people against one another in order to advance, because a good performance speaks for itself. Some office politics are related to disputes about who deserves a promotion or more power in the workplace. Stay out of these conversations and build up your reputation as a hard worker.","output":"This article says that it is okay to get water during work, but we should be careful not to join gossip near the water cooler. To avoid office problems, pick safe times and safe friends for breaks and lunch. Always ask your boss questions about your work to avoid making mistakes.

This is because bleach has a strong odor that can be harmful when inhaled for an extended period. Having a well-ventilated area also allows the bleach to work more effectively. Step 2: Gather Necessary Materials For this process, you'll need: - Laundry bleach (chlorine bleach or color-safe bleach, depending on your clothes) - Rubber gloves - A basin or container large enough for the clothes - Cold water - A measuring cup - A mild detergent - A soft brush or cloth (optional, for scrubbing) Step 3: Sort the Clothes Separate white clothes from colored ones. Chlorine bleach is ideal for white clothes, as it can cause discoloration on colored garments. If you need to use bleach on colored clothes, use a color-safe bleach specifically designed for that purpose. Step 4: Dilute the Bleach Follow the instructions on the bleach bottle for the appropriate dilution ratio. Generally, you should dilute 1/4 cup of bleach in 1 gallon of cold water for white clothes or 1 cup of color-safe bleach in a gallon of water for colored clothes. Always dilute the bleach to avoid damaging the fabric. Step 5: Pre-treat Stains (optional) If there are specific stains on the clothes, you can pre-treat them by applying a small amount of the diluted bleach directly onto the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes (around 3-5 minutes) before proceeding to the next step. Step 6: Soak the Clothes Fully submerge the clothes in the bleach solution and let them soak for around 5-10 minutes. Make sure to wear rubber gloves to protect your skin from the bleach. Step 7: Handwash the Clothes Add mild detergent to the water and gently agitate the clothes to remove dirt and stains. You can use a soft brush or cloth to help remove stubborn stains. Do this for around 5-10 minutes. Step 8: Rinse the Clothes Thoroughly rinse the clothes under cold running water until no traces of detergent and bleach remain. You may need to change the water a few times to ensure proper rinsing. Step 9: Dry the Clothes Gently wring out the excess water from the clothes. Avoid twisting the clothes too much as it may cause damage to the fabric. Hang the clothes to dry in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight. By following these steps, you can effectively use bleach when handwashing clothes, ensuring that they are clean and properly sanitized."},{"instruction":"Q:The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

Answer:","output":"Although the correct answer you suggested is \\"wind,\\" it is important to understand that wind is just one factor that can contribute to the increase of lake levels due to storms. When considering the impact of storms on lakes, there are several factors to examine. These factors include, but are not limited to, precipitation, runoff, wind, and evaporation. 1. Precipitation: During storms, a significant amount of rainfall can occur in the lake's catchment area. This additional water may increase the water level in the lake. Heavy rainfall events during storms can overwhelm rivers, streams, and other bodies of water leading to the lake, causing an increase in the lake's water level. 2. Runoff: When rainwater falls on impermeable surfaces such as roads, roofs, and sidewalks, it cannot infiltrate into the ground. Instead, the water runs off these surfaces and may eventually find its way into lakes and other bodies of water. The accumulation of runoff during storms can, therefore, contribute to an increase in lake levels. 3. Wind: Wind plays a crucial role in increasing lake levels during storms through a process known as seiche. A seiche occurs when strong winds push the water surface in one direction, leading to water piling up on one side of the lake. When the wind subsides, the water rushes back in the opposite direction, leading to fluctuations in water levels. Also, winds can generate waves that cause coastal erosion and displacement of water, which can incrementally expand the lake's boundaries and increase its volume. 4. Evaporation: While storms typically result in more precipitation than evaporation, it is important to note that the process of evaporation does influence lake levels. During periods of low precipitation or high temperatures, the rate of evaporation may exceed the rate of rainfall, leading to a decrease in lake levels. Taking the factors mentioned above into account, you can conclude that although wind is a contributing factor, the correct answer to the question \\"lakes can increase due to\\" should be more comprehensive - \\"lakes can increase due to precipitation, runoff, wind, and other factors during storms.\\""},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: A very brief pre-credits sequence shows an execution beside a pool, where a young blindfolded woman is decapitated by a man while two other complicit individuals watch.At a university, Dr. Ernst Prell (Alan Brock) lectures a small group of four students, Keith (Michael Harris), Karen (Jennifer Stock), Lynn (Darcy Brown), and Tom (Jack Neubeck).

Macron has begun a rare week-long memorial tour of north-east France, calling at villages and small towns that a century ago witnessed the bloodshed of the war and that are now struggling against deindustrialisation and unemployment. “When I see President Trump announcing that he’s quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the 1980s Euromissile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim? Europe and its security,” he said in a radio interview to mark 100 years since the end of hostilities. “Peace in Europe is precarious,” he said. The tour culminates on Sunday when Macron hosts Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and dozens of other heads of state at an armistice commemoration in Paris followed by an international “peace conference”. Arriving in Verdun, the site of one of the longest and most savagely fought battles of the war, Macron honoured the local people who fought and died in the trenches. He has argued that modern French society more than ever needs to hail “everyday heroes” such as these. The tour is also aimed at addressing his falling personal popularity ratings, which have reached a new low of less than 30%. An Ifop survey published on Sunday showed that Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party – formerly Front National – had moved ahead of Macron’s centrists for the first time. Far-right and anti-EU parties had combined support of 30%, up from 25% at the end of the summer. Macron, who came to power last year by defeating Le Pen and who has promised to save the EU by championing greater integration, intends to style himself as a leader of progressives against hardline nationalism in the European elections next spring. Although his party firmly controls the French parliament, giving him free rein to implement his pro-business manifesto and overhaul labour and the welfare state, he is struggling to shake off his image as a member of the metropolitan elite, cut off from peripheral towns and villages such as those on the centenary trail in the north-east. What was once seen as Macron’s straight-talking is now criticised as arrogance. Nationwide protests and blockades against higher fuel prices scheduled for later this month have added to the government’s difficulties. Macron stopped outside Verdun town hall to talk to local residents, some of whom complained that he was letting down pensioners, students and workers. “Do you feel the malaise in France?” shouted a retired factory worker. “I hear you, I respect you,” Macron said. The president called for pragmatism, saying he could not offer an immediate fix for what he argued was nearly 40 years of drift. He said France’s problem with mass unemployment was unique in Europe and he vowed to transform the work, welfare and pensions system. “I know what’s being said. I know there is impatience and anger,” he said. Residents shrugged. Aldo, 59, who had worked as a carpenter since the age of 16 but was now on disability allowance, said he had voted for Le Pen. “Macron’s a former banker, he only listens to the rich,” he said. “At the next election I don’t think I’ll bother to vote at all.” Macron is likely to warn Trump, Putin and other leaders on Sunday that multilateralism and cooperation between nations must be protected in what he calls a new era of isolationism and populism akin to that of the 1930s. “I am struck by similarities between the times we live in and those between the two world wars,” he told a French newspaper last week, adding that nationalism was a “leprosy” spreading worldwide. Trump, who greatly appreciated attending France’s vast Bastille Day military parade in Paris last summer, might have expected military fanfare. But the armistice centenary in France has deliberately focused on civilians, not the military – it is not a celebration of victory but a focus on the need for peace, largely because of the bloodshed of the second world war that followed so soon after. Macron also used his armistice trip to address a painful part of French colonial history by paying tribute to African troops who fought in France in the war. These soldiers, often referred to as Senegalese tirailleurs (riflemen), were in fact drawn from all over west Africa and were seen as never having been given the prominence they deserved in French history books. Macron was to be joined in the north-east city of Reims by the Malian president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, whose great-grandfather fought and died in the battle of Verdun and whose body was never found. France deployed an estimated 200,000 black troops in the war. Mor Ndao, a history professor at Cheikh Anta Diop University in the Senegalese capital, Dakar, told AFP that France had never “recognised sufficiently the role and importance of the tirailleurs”. He said: “Their treatment has been unequal compared to their French and European brothers in arms.” ||||| French President Emmanuel Macron is calling for the formation of a “real European army” to protect the continent “with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.” Agence France-Presse reports that while on a tour of World War I memorials Tuesday, Macron said: “We will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army.” Macron has advocated for the mobilization of a collective European force since his election last year. But those calls may be received with more urgency after President Trump announced last month that the U.S. would pull out of a Cold War era nuclear weapons treaty with Russia. Trump has also displayed a tepid attitude in the past towards NATO’s mutual defense commitments. “When I see President Trump announcing that he’s quitting a major disarmament treaty, who is the main victim? Europe and its security,” Macron said on a visit to Verdun, a French city that was the site of a major battle in 1916.

The E.U. launched an annual €5.5 billion (6.3 billion) joint defense fund last year, and added another €13 billion (14.8 billion) in defense spending in June to support development of new military technology. France has also led the formation of a nine-country rapid deployment force to respond to crises like evacuations or natural disasters. Macron is preparing to host dozens of world leaders, including Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday to mark the 100th anniversary of the World War I armistice. But ahead of that anniversary, the French president has spoken of modern threats to European peace, including the reemergence of “authoritarian powers” and “intrusion attempts in cyber-space” seeking to derail democratic elections in Europe. (Russia has been accused of intervening in elections in France as well as supporting far-right parties in Germany and elsewhere.) “Peace in Europe is precarious,” Macron said.

On a visit to the former Western Front in Verdun, he said Russia had shown it could be a threat and Europe had to be able \\"to defend itself better alone\\". Russia's president will be among world leaders marking the Armistice in Paris. Mr Macron has already proposed a joint intervention force for crisis missions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel backed the idea of an intervention force in June, but said it would have to be part of \\"the structure of defence co-operation\\". The UK, while in favour of such a joint force, is opposed to a European army, because of the potential risk of creating a parallel structure to Nato. President Macron has already warned that Europeans can no longer rely on the US to defend them, and he revived the theme on Tuesday, in response to President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of a 1987 nuclear treaty with Russia, banning medium-range ground-launched missiles. \\"Who is the main victim? Europe and its security,\\" he told French radio station Europe 1. \\"I want to build a real security dialogue with Russia, which is a country I respect, a European country - but we must have a Europe that can defend itself on its own without relying only on the United States.\\" Speaking about cyber security, he also said: \\"We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.\\" Will there be a European army? By Defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus There is no evidence that any group of European countries has the political will or economic muscle to spend sufficiently on defence to make up for the United States' raw power. Indeed the deployment of troops \\"into harm's way\\" remains the ultimate sovereign decision of a national government. There is no \\"Nato army\\" today - merely an alliance of national components trained and accustomed to operating together. President Macron's call for a greater European effort in defence derives from two sets of factors: his support for the greater European project on the one hand, but also horror at much that the Trump Administration is doing on the other, with its overturning of treaties and so on.

And what of the longer-term threat from China? The US relationship may be problematic but it could be becoming more important than ever.

'Ultra-liberal Europe' Last week he warned of the \\"leprosy\\" of nationalism spreading worldwide and declared that he had been struck by the similarities of current times and the period between World War One and World War Two. UK Prime Minister Theresa May will join Mr Macron on Friday at the Somme while President Trump will join dozens of world leaders for Sunday's ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. During his interview on Tuesday, Mr Macron warned that there was anger against a \\"too ultra-liberal Europe that no longer allows our middle classes a decent living\\". He spoke of Europe that was becoming increasingly fractured and singled out the UK's vote to leave the EU as part of that disenchantment. President Macron's opponents have accused him of being out of touch with the everyday problems of French voters, and have called for a national protest against higher fuel taxes on France's roads on 17 November. The latest opinion poll ahead of May 2019 European Parliament elections suggests Mr Macron's LREM party is trailing the far-right National Rally party for the first time.

A brother has spoken of the moment a seaside adventure turned to tragedy and his regrets at leaving his sister trapped in a water-filled cave while he tried to get help. Charlotte Furness-Smith, 30, died after she and her brother Alex were swept into the cave as they spent a day climbing sea cliffs. The terrified former Royal Navy Reserve screamed ‘Get me out of here’, as rescuers spent two hours trying to reach her. Her brother tried to summon help on his mobile phone but couldn’t get a signal. The 31-year-old decided to leave his sister, who was known as Buffy, while he dived underwater and swam out to get help. Scroll down for video. Tragic: Charlotte 'Buffy' Furness-Smith, 30, was swept into the tiny cave while coasteering with her brother Alex (right). He told an inquest how he was forced to leave her to drown while he tried to get help. Rescue: Two RNLI coastguards, circled, stand just above the cave where Charlotte Furness-Smith was trapped. Tragic: Royal Navy Reserve Charlotte Furness-Smith, pictured, who drowned in a Dorset sea cave. He told the inquest into his sister’s death yesterday: ‘Buffy was a bit scared but we talked and she calmed down. I told her it would be OK. ‘After a while it became apparent we could not keep being battered by the waves. ‘We had a mobile phone with us in a waterproof bag so we tried to dial 999 but there was no reception. We looked to swim out of the cave but every time we saw an opportunity another big wave came crashing in. ‘It appeared the only option was for one of us to swim outside to get help. ‘I decided to swim out of the cave. Buffy wanted to go with me. She said she could not bear not knowing if something had happened to me. Charlotte and her brother Alex (pictured) were swept into the inlet by ferocious waves as they took part in the dangerous sport of coasteering. Ian Bugler, second right, was the coastguard who went down the blowhole trying to save Miss Furness. By the time he entered the cave at cliffs near Swanage, Charlotte had drowned, the inquest heard. He described the moment he found her body after being lowered down the 15ft hole just wide enough for him. ‘I said that she should be able to see me going out and if I did get into danger she would have a second chance of getting out. I asked her to stay put. I thought that was the safest thing to do.’ Coastguards and lifeboat crews were unable to reach Miss Furness-Smith because of the severe conditions and spoke to her through a blowhole in the top of the cave. The inquest heard coastguard Ian Bugler risked his life by being lowered down the narrow hole. Charlotte Furness-Smith who drowned in a cave in Dorset after taking part in the dangerous sport of coasteering. But by the time he entered the cave at cliffs near Swanage, Dorset, she had drowned. Her body has never been recovered. Mr Furness-Smith was plucked out of the sea by a coastguard helicopter at 3pm on November 2 last year, while a lifeboat crew tried to reach the entrance to the cave but was beaten back by the waves. Andrew Bugler, station officer for St Albans Coastguard, was part of the team who attempted the rescue. Rescue attempt: Her brother, Alex, left her trapped in the cave while he called for the Coastguard. They rushed to the scene, but could not save her in time. He said: ‘They were shouting down every three to four minutes. I could hear her screaming back, “Get me out of here”. She sounded terrified.’ Russell Thompson, an expert in coasteering who runs guided tours along the Dorset coast, told the inquest that conditions on November 2 were too dangerous to consider going in the water. He said: ‘We would have never have even thought about getting into the water that day.’ Miss Furness-Smith, a maths teacher from Bristol, had travelled to the Dorset coast with her brother to go kite-surfing but it was too windy so they decided to go coasteering at Tilly Whim Caves near Swanage. They put on wetsuits, buoyancy aids and helmets before clambering down the cliff onto a ledge and jumped in at 1.30pm. As they swam past the cave entrance they were hit by a 15ft sea swell whipped up by gale-force winds and were swept into it. Charlotte Furness-Smith's mother, Patricia, arrived at Bournemouth Coroner's Court to hear the evidence. Part-way through, Miss Furness-Smith's mother and father, Charles, branded the proceedings 'a charade' Part way through the inquest in Bournemouth yesterday, Miss Furness-Smith’s parents, Patricia, 57, and Charles, 58, from Amersham, Buckinghamshire, branded the proceedings ‘a charade’. They appeared to be unhappy that certain witnesses they wanted to ask questions of were not at the inquest, although it was not made clear who they were referring to. The inquest continues. Aftermath: In the hours after the horrifying incident, rescuers had to retrieve her body from the tiny inlet. Today, Alex, 31, told an inquest she screamed for help while she was trapped in the small cave. Tide: A lifeboat crew tried to reach the 5ft entrance to the cave but was beaten back by the waves. One rescuer was lowered down into the cave, but Charlotte was already dead. Adrian Rogers, helicopter paramedic winchman, was also in attendance to hear the accounts of what happened.

(Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child.

Official details are scarce, but the Israeli strike reportedly hit a warehouse that contained high-tech missiles, though not chemical weapons. Israeli officials feared that Bashar al-Assad was sending them to Hezbollah in Lebanon, reports AP. Residents fleeing: The BBC reports that hundreds of Syrians have fled coastal areas amid unconfirmed accounts of at least two massacres by pro-government militia members. A BBC correspondent says videos, which haven't been verified, show corpses including women and children in the villages of al-Bayda and Baniya. Opposition groups allege that a campaign of \\"sectarian cleansing\\" is underway to set up a safe haven for members of the minority Alawite sect, of which Assad is a member. Expand this summary.","output":"Two concerning events have taken place in Syria, raising alarm amongst international observers and further illustrating the ongoing turmoil in the war-torn nation. Firstly, Israeli Air Force has conducted an airstrike within Syrian borders for the second time this year, as reported by Reuters. While the official details of the attack remain scarce, it is believed that the Israeli strike targeted a warehouse containing high-tech missiles. Although these missiles are not thought to be chemical weapons, Israeli officials feared that they might fall into the hands of the Hezbollah militant group based in Lebanon. According to the Associated Press, Israeli authorities were concerned that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was supplying these weapons to Hezbollah. Israel has not officially confirmed these airstrikes; however, if true, they would demonstrate the broader regional impact of the ongoing conflict in Syria and the increasing risk of escalation. Secondly, the BBC has reported a mass exodus of Syrian civilians from coastal areas due to unverified accounts of at least two massacres perpetrated by pro-government militia. Videos have surfaced online, showing what appear to be dead bodies of women and children in the villages of al-Bayda and Baniya. While the authenticity of these videos has yet to be independently verified, they have added to the growing horror of events unfolding in Syria. Opposition groups and various human rights organizations have alleged that these actions represent a campaign of \\"sectarian cleansing\\" by forces loyal to the government. The suspected goal is to establish a secure haven for members of the minority Alawite sect, the religious group to which President Bashar al-Assad belongs. If these reports and allegations are proven true, the situation in Syria increasingly risks spiraling out of control and engulfing neighboring nations. The Israeli airstrikes highlight the potential spillover effect of this crisis into neighboring countries and the corresponding threat it poses to regional stability. The alleged massacres contribute to the mounting evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity that have been taking place in the context of the Syrian conflict. These events, once again, underscore the urgent need for a political resolution of the ongoing crisis and the importance of humanitarian protection for Syrian civilians caught amid the crossfire. In conclusion, the latest developments in Syria involving the alleged Israeli airstrikes and the exodus of Syrian civilians fleeing potential massacres indicate the alarming exacerbation of the conflict and its regional implications. Both these incidents further substantiate the fears that the Syrian crisis is reaching a dangerous tipping point, with devastating consequences not only for the country's population but also for regional and international security. It is critical for the international community to consider potential solutions to address the humanitarian crisis and resolve the political situation as soon as possible, in order to prevent further tragedy and unrest in the region."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I can use this background: The Hawaiian Islands ( Figure above ) are in the central Pacific Ocean.

It houses a myriad of channels and stations, catering to audiences across the globe. Located in the heart of London, the BBC Broadcasting House has been the headquarters of the corporation since its opening in 1932. Recently, the architectural marvel experienced a significant extension to accommodate the growing demand for space and facilities. In this review, we will delve into the details of the much-awaited upgrade and analyse its impact on the corporation and its employees. Step 1: Discuss the background and the need for extension Over the years, the BBC's Broadcasting House has undergone several extensions and renovations. However, the latest round of upgrades was deemed necessary to accommodate the expanding range of the network's services, streamline operations, and incorporate state-of-the-art facilities that cater to the modern needs of the broadcasting industry. Step 2: Explore the design and architectural features The extension project was spearheaded by architectural firm Sheppard Robson, a well-known player in the industry. It features a seamless blend of the existing Art Deco building with the new cutting-edge designs. The extension includes spacious, open-air studios and offices that promote collaboration and creativity, and the fully-equipped space houses over 6,000 members of staff. The glass-fronted façade of the new extension adds a touch of modernity to the historic Broadcasting House while integrating harmoniously with the original structure. Step 3: Highlight environmental and sustainability considerations A crucial aspect of the Broadcasting House extension was the focus on environmental sustainability. The new building is designed to be energy-efficient, with a state-of-the-art heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system that reduces energy consumption. Furthermore, the incorporation of green roofs and living walls help to minimise the urban heat island effect and promote biodiversity. The Broadcasting House extension has achieved an 'Excellent' rating under the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), which attests to its eco-friendly and sustainable features. Step 4: Evaluate the impact on the corporation and staff The expansion of the Broadcasting House has not only provided additional space and resources for the BBC's operations but has also created a more collaborative and dynamic workplace for the staff. The new offices and studios allow for greater interaction amongst employees, fostering innovation and creativity. Additionally, the focus on sustainability and eco-friendly designs has garnered praise from environmentalists and the general public, enhancing the BBC's image as an environmentally responsible organisation. Conclusion: The extension of the BBC Broadcasting House has been an impressive undertaking that has successfully combined modern design elements with the preservation of the historic existing building. By providing state-of-the-art facilities to over 6,000 employees, the extension has profoundly impacted the corporation's operational efficiency and overall atmosphere. The attention to environmental sustainability and the implementation of eco-friendly features further position the BBC Broadcasting House extension as a fitting tribute to the growth and success of this venerable institution."},{"instruction":"Q: Title: Just a lot of hype Review: I purchased this product at the suggestion of my husband after he saw an infomercial for the product. I was hesitant because I had purchased a different model of the Euro-Pro Shark Cordless Sweeper back in 2003 and promptly returned it. This latest model is no different as far as performance. It is very expensive and for what? It made skid marks on my kitchen floor, it feels very flimsy and I was afraid I would break it, because the dust cup is plastic it creates static electricity which makes the debris just cling to the dust cup. I just was not pleased with the product. It just doesn't seem to have any \\"meat\\" to it. I have three dogs and two cats and need something with strength and power to clean the kitchen floor. For me this product just didn't meet my criteria. Is this product review negative? A:","output":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction from the onset, citing an initial hesitation due to a past experience with a similar model by the same brand. They go on to critique general aspects of the product like its construction, quality and functionality. The reviewer states the product feels \\"flimsy,\\" indicating concerns about the product’s durability and robustness. They worry that it could easily break and point out specific features – such as the use of plastic for a dust cup – that they believe contribute to its underwhelming integrity. They also note that the dust cup creates static electricity which causes debris to cling to it. This point suggests they find the product hard to use and clean, a criticism that furthers the negative slant of the review. In addition, the reviewer mentions that the product makes skid marks on their kitchen floor, which shows it fails to satisfy their cleaning needs effectively without causing additional problems. Finally, the review concludes by stating that the product lacks \\"meat\\" - a metaphorical way of saying the product lacks quality, substance, or required functions for it to be deemed satisfactory. The reviewer elaborates they need a cleaner with strength and power due to their three dogs and two cats, a requirement this product fails to meet. The exclamation questioning the high cost of the product further brings out the reviewer's disappointment by implying that the product isn't worth its price point. In conclusion, the overall tone of frustration, disappointment, and dissatisfaction confirms that this is indeed a negative review. The reviewer explicitly states their displeasure with the product’s performance, construction, and even its price point, suggesting that it's not a satisfactory purchase for them."},{"instruction":"Question: Question: When John turned on the light he saw a severed gazelle head. Where was John? Options: - ball gown - zoo - ivory coast - trophy room - kalahari desert The answer is \\"trophy room\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"trophy room\\" because: Step 1: Analyzing the options provided Out of the given options - ball gown, zoo, ivory coast, trophy room, and kalahari desert - we need to determine the most appropriate location where John is likely to find a severed gazelle head. Step 2: Eliminating unlikely options A ball gown is not a location, making it an invalid option. The ivory coast option refers to a geographical area, which doesn't provide enough context to confirm John's location. The kalahari desert is a wildlife habitat, but the presence of a turned-on light implies that John is indoors. Step 3: Comparing the remaining options Considering both the zoo and trophy room, both locations involve animals. However, while a zoo is built for the housing, preservation, and observation of animals, a trophy room is a place where hunters typically display their kills as hunting trophies. Step 4: Selecting the most appropriate option Given that John saw a severed gazelle head and turned on a light, it makes more sense for him to be in a trophy room, where the severed gazelle head could be part of a hunting display. Thus, the answer is \\"trophy room.\\""},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The trouble started when Mrs. Cady lost control of her car on a mountain road.

Choices: - sixteen - five - eight - six A: The answer is:","output":"To determine the answer to this question, we need to first identify the most common isotopes of carbon and then calculate the number of neutrons in each isotope. Step 1: Identify the common isotopes of carbon Carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: Carbon-12, Carbon-13, and Carbon-14. Step 2: Determine the isotopic abundances Carbon-12 is by far the most common isotope, making up 98.89% of all carbon atoms. Carbon-13 accounts for 1.11%, while Carbon-14 is extremely rare (less than 0.01%). Step 3: Identify the isotope that represents 99% of carbon atoms Since 98.89% of carbon atoms are Carbon-12, and this is the greatest percentage of any isotope, we can conclude that Carbon-12 represents the 99% of carbon atoms mentioned in the question. Step 4: Calculate the number of neutrons in the most common isotope Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Since the number of neutrons makes up half its atomic mass (12), there are 6 neutrons in the most common carbon isotope (Carbon-12).

Two years later, Rowan LaFontaine, a government scientist, decides to place Jason in cryogenic suspension after several unsuccessful attempts to kill him. While Private Samuel Johnson places a blanket on Jason (who is hanging in chains) Dr. Aloysius Bartholomew Wimmer, Segeant Marcus, and a few soldiers hope to conduct further research into Jason's rapid cellular regeneration and instead try to take Jason. They pull off the blanket of what is supposedly Jason, but find a dead Johnson instead. Having broken free of his restraints, Jason kills the team of soldiers. Wimmer is killed by being impaled with a thrown machete. Rowan then spots Marcus thrown through the door. Before dying, he tells her to run.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"The situation you presented is quite complex and involves multiple elements: the process of forest formation, a faulty magnet in a phone, and dead trees in the forest. It seems these elements are unrelated to each other. However, to address your question about the supposed perturbation, we should analyze each option: 1. Directly impacting a step of the process: A faulty magnet in a phone is unlikely to have any direct impact on the process of forest formation or dead trees in the forest. These are separate phenomena, and unless the magnet causes a chain reaction that affects forest growth or leads to tree death, there's no direct connection between the faulty magnet and the forest. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: While it's still improbable, the faulty magnet could indirectly impact the forest if it leads to circumstances that negatively impact the environment. For instance, if the magnet causes the phone to malfunction, and the user improperly disposes of their broken phone, leading to electronic waste, it might contribute to an increase in pollution. This pollution could, in turn, negatively affect the process of forest formation or the health of trees. Nonetheless, the potential impact of a single phone's faulty magnet on the forest is minimal and negligible. 3. Not impacting any step of the process: This is the most likely option. A faulty magnet in a phone should not have any impact on the process of forest formation or dead trees in the forest as these are separate phenomena and not related to each other. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation is most likely \\"not impacting any step of the process.\\" A faulty magnet in a phone has no significant connection to the forest ecosystem, making it highly improbable to affect the forest's formation or health."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: Caterpillar Inc., keyPerson, Douglas R.

Translate to English","output":"It is true that, with the recent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Parliament will need, overall, additional capacities for administrative work. However, after the introduction of the status of assistants at the beginning of the current legislature, we still do not have clear evidence that more assistants are needed. The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on December 1, 2009, brought significant changes to the functioning of the European Union and its institutions, including the European Parliament. One of the main objectives of the treaty was to enhance the democratic legitimacy of the EU by strengthening the role of the European Parliament in decision-making processes and increasing its powers in areas such as legislative and budgetary matters, foreign and security policy, and appointment procedures for high-level EU officeholders. As a result of this increased role, the Parliament is indeed faced with a higher workload and more complex administrative tasks, meaning that it requires additional resources, including staff and administrative capacities, to effectively carry out its duties. With regard to the status of assistants, it is important to differentiate between different types of staff that work for the European Parliament. There are Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and their personal staff, who are also known as parliamentary assistants. These assistants are directly employed by MEPs to support them in their daily tasks and legislative activities. At the beginning of the current legislative term, the status of parliamentary assistants was introduced, along with rules governing their employment conditions, duties, and obligations, in an effort to ensure a more transparent and professional relationship between MEPs and their assistants. While it has been acknowledged that the Treaty of Lisbon has led to a higher workload for the European Parliament and its Members, it is not immediately clear whether this increased workload has led to a specific necessity for more parliamentary assistants. It should be noted that Parliament does have access to various other resources and supports, such as committee secretariats and political group staff, which also contribute to managing the responsibilities brought about by the treaty. However, it could be argued that further analysis and assessment regarding the potential need for increased staffing levels would be beneficial. This could involve an examination of the existing workloads of parliamentary assistants, as well as exploring alternative solutions that may address the administrative challenges arising from the Treaty of Lisbon, and thus ensuring the European Parliament functions effectively and efficiently. In conclusion, while the Treaty of Lisbon has undeniably increased the administrative and workload demands on the European Parliament and its staff, it is not yet definitively established whether there is a specific need for a higher number of parliamentary assistants. Further evaluation and assessment of the existing resources and challenges implied by the treaty would provide a more informed basis for deciding on the necessity of such a measure."},{"instruction":"Here are some keywords about a restaurant: name = The Eagle, eatType = coffee shop, food = Indian, priceRange = high, customer rating = average, area = city centre, familyFriendly = yes, near = Burger King.

The correct answer is option 1 as it elaborates on the fact that even if a standard agreement exists, companies are aware that adjustments might be necessary for different situations. This option also prompts the reader to determine the scope of the agreement. Option 2 is incorrect because it implies that the changes to the agreement should only suit the company's needs while ignoring the needs of the other party, which is not the point of the paragraph. Option 3 is incorrect because the paragraph does not suggest that a standard contract eliminates the need to draft an agreement.

Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The data provided consists of information about a popular dessert originating from the Derbyshire Dales region in England - the Bakewell pudding. Additionally, the data also presents a variation of the dish, known as the Bakewell tart, and mentions the key ingredient used in the tart, which is fruit preserves. Bakewell pudding is a traditional English dessert that hails from the pastoral Derbyshire Dales region in the heart of the United Kingdom. This region is well-known for its picturesque beauty, charming villages, and, of course, its delicious culinary creations. The Derbyshire Dales is situated in the eastern part of the Peak District National Park and is a popular destination for locals and tourists alike. The Bakewell pudding, as our data provides, has a variation known as the Bakewell tart. While both dishes share similarities in name and origin, they have certain differences in texture, appearance, and ingredients that set them apart from one another. The original Bakewell pudding is made with a puff pastry base, filled with a layer of jam and covered with an egg-and-almond paste mixture. On the other hand, the Bakewell tart follows a slightly different recipe. This delightful variation consists of a shortcrust pastry base with similar jam filling, but instead of an egg-and-almond paste mixture, it features a frangipane filling (a creamy almond-flavored concoction made using butter, sugar, ground almonds, and eggs). The tart is usually adorned with a layer of icing and sometimes, a cherry or flaked almonds on top. An essential ingredient in the Bakewell tart, as highlighted in the provided data, is fruit preserves. Fruit preserves are a versatile ingredient central to the dish's distinct flavor. Made by cooking fruits, sugar, and often a natural gelling agent like pectin, the preserves impart a sweet and tangy taste to the tart. The most commonly used fruit preserves for the Bakewell tart are raspberry or strawberry, but one can also experiment with other flavors such as apricot, blackcurrant, or cherry to suit their preferences.

A celebrated descent from antiquity (the Bagratid \\"line\\") begins with Arsaces. Arsaces or Ashk has also given name to the city of Ashkabad. - Vologases I of Parthia ( Persian : ) sometimes called Vologaeses or Vologeses or following Parthian usage , Walagash ( Persian : Balsh ) was king of the Parthian Empire from about 51 until his death in 78 . - The Parthian Empire (247 BC 224 AD), also known as the Arsacid Empire, was a major Iranian political and cultural power in ancient Iran and Iraq. Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of the Parni tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Iran's northeast, then a satrapy (province) in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I of Parthia (r. \\"c\\". 171138 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now central-eastern Turkey, to eastern Iran. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han Empire of China, became a center of trade and commerce. - The Seleucid Empire (\\"Basileía tn Seleukidn\\") was a Hellenistic state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty, which existed from 312 BC to 63 BC; it was founded by Seleucus I Nicator following the division of the Macedonian empire vastly expanded by Alexander the Great. Seleucus received Babylonia and, from there, expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander's near eastern territories. At the height of its power, it included central Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and what is now Kuwait, Afghanistan, and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan. Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'noble family' with the subject 'vologases i of parthia'. Choices: - arsacid dynasty of parthia - seleucid empire The answer to this question is:","output":"Arsacid Dynasty of Parthia Vologases I of Parthia, also known as Walagash in Persian, was a king of the Parthian Empire, which was a major Iranian political and cultural power in ancient Iran and Iraq. The Parthian Empire, also known as the Arsacid Empire, was founded in the mid-3rd century BC by Arsaces I of Parthia, who led the Parni tribe to conquer the region of Parthia in Iran's northeast. This region was previously a satrapy (province) in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. The Arsacid Dynasty of Parthia was the ruling noble family from which Vologases I belonged, and all 30+ monarchs of the Arsacid Empire officially named themselves after its founder, Arsaces. This celebrated lineage from antiquity, referred to as the Bagratid \\"line,\\" begins with Arsaces. The name Arsaces, or Ashk, has also given its name to the city of Ashkabad.

The Seleucid Empire had no direct noble family relation to Vologases I of Parthia, despite having territorial connections before the Parthian Empire was established. To summarize, the object entity that exhibits the relation 'noble family' with the subject 'Vologases I of Parthia' is the Arsacid Dynasty of Parthia.

By Kimberley Dadds, Louise Saunders and Martin Robinson PUBLISHED: 19:04 EST, 31 January 2013 | UPDATED: 07:48 EST, 1 February 2013 Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross have apologised publicly for the 'Sachsgate' affair only to cause more controversy by cracking jokes about the Jimmy Savile paedophile scandal. The pair have been reunited on television for the first time since their 2008 prank on BBC Radio 2, as the comedian appeared on Ross's ITV1 chat show set for broadcast tomorrow night. But unable to avoid controversy for long, Brand said his friend 'didn't give a monkey's' about the furore caused after they made a series of offensive hoax phone calls to Fawlty Towers star Andrew Sachs. It led to the departure of the OPTIONS: - Andrew Sachs station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. - BBC Radio 2 station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. - Brand station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. - Fawlty Towers station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. - ITV station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. - ITV1 station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. - Jimmy Savile station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. - Jonathan Ross station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. - Kimberley Dadds station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. - Louise Saunders station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. - Martin Robinson station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. - Ross station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. - Russell Brand station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. - Savile station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout.","output":"BBC Radio 2 station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. In this situation, the most logical completion of the news story is that the BBC Radio 2 station controller was affected by the scandal, which then resulted in both Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross leaving the BBC. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - \\"Andrew Sachs station controller\\" and other names mentioned are not related to the management of the radio station. - \\"Fawlty Towers station controller\\": Fawlty Towers is a TV show and not a radio station. - \\"ITV station controller\\" and \\"ITV1 station controller\\": ITV is a different network and not related to the BBC Radio 2. - \\"Jimmy Savile station controller\\": Jimmy Savile was not a station controller, and the controversy mentioned in the beginning of the story was related to him. So, the correct answer is about the BBC Radio 2 station controller, because that's where the prank happened, and both Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross were working for the BBC at that time."},{"instruction":"Are the following two questions the same?

This leaves us with 45687 = 278*d + 48467. Next, let's subtract 48467 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with d in it. This will leave us with: 45687 - 48467 = 278*d This gives us -2780 = 278d. Now we want to solve for d, so we will divide both sides by 278. -2780 ÷ 278 will give us our answer.

In 1737, the Marathas defeated a Mughal army in their capital, Delhi itself in Battle of Delhi (1737). The Marathas continued their military campaigns against Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal and Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. Gordon explained how the Maratha systematically took control over new regions. They would start with annual raids, followed by collecting ransom from villages and towns while the declining Mughal Empire retained nominal control and finally taking over the region. He explained it with the example of Malwa region. Marathas built an efficient system of public administration known for its attention to detail. It succeeded in raising revenue in districts that recovered from years of raids, up to levels previously enjoyed by the Mughals. For example, the cornerstone of the Maratha rule in Malwa rested on the 60 or so local tax collectors who advanced the Maratha ruler Peshwa a portion of their district revenues at interest. By 1760, the domain of the Marathas stretched across practically the entire subcontinent. The north-western expansion of the Marathas was stopped after the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). However, the Maratha authority in the north was re-established within a decade under Peshwa Madhavrao I. The defeat of Marathas by British in third Anglo-Maratha Wars brought end to the empire by 1820. The last peshwa, Baji Rao II, was defeated by the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of increased meat production leading to more damaged plant life could have both direct and indirect effects on the oil formation process. Let's look at both aspects in detail. Direct Effects: 1. More plant material: With a higher number of plants being damaged due to increased meat production, there could be a larger quantity of dead organic material available to accumulate on the bottom of oceans, riverbeds, or swamps. This could influence the rate at which new oil deposits are being formed. 2. Change in the quality of organic material: The type and quality of organic material might be different from that of the pre-existing material in the sediment layers. For example, damaged plant life may have more cellulose or lignin content compared to the existing sediment layers. This would result in a different chemical composition of the source material for oil formation, potentially affecting the kerogen transformation process. Indirect Effects: 1. Land use and ecosystem changes: Increased meat production could lead to more land being cleared for agriculture and livestock farming purposes. This could disturb the natural ecosystems, leading to changes in the plant and animal life that contribute to oil formation. Moreover, land-use change may affect existing oil deposits and could alter the rate of new oil formation in the long run. 2. Alteration of the carbon cycle: Increased meat production might contribute to a surge in greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which could affect the carbon cycle. An altered carbon cycle might impact the oil formation process through changes in the atmospheric carbon content, ocean circulation, and other Earth system processes. 3. Water quality and sedimentation: Increased agricultural activities might lead to increased nutrient loads in nearby water bodies, causing eutrophication and altering the rate of sedimentation. This could affect the accumulation of organic material at the bottom of oceans, riverbeds, or swamps, ultimately affecting the oil formation process. 4. Human-driven perturbations to oil reservoirs: The increased demand for meat may drive the need for greater oil and gas production to supply energy for the meat production industry. This might lead to more drilling, extraction, and transport of oil and gas, which in turn, could cause changes in the pressure and temperature conditions in the reservoirs and potentially affect the oil formation process or the ability to extract the oil effectively. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of increased meat production leading to more damaged plant life can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of oil formation. However, it is essential to consider that these effects may be influenced by various factors such as the extent of plant damage, location, and global climatic conditions."},{"instruction":"At last save your error free DOC/DOCX file to your desired location by using “Save” option Please remove spaces between words.","output":"To save your error-free DOC or DOCX file to your desired location using the \\"Save\\" option, follow these step-by-step instructions: 1.

While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective.

The author recognized that this negative behavior could be disheartening and demotivating to many content creators, with some even giving up on sharing their work due to the fear of facing the \\"wrath of the internet.\\" Seeing this problem, the author felt that there was not enough information and guidance available on how to effectively deal with and manage such disrespectful behavior online. They understood that while there is no perfect solution to completely eradicate this issue, it is essential for individuals to learn how to put these negative and non-constructive comments into perspective, identify legitimate criticism, and navigate the online world confidently without being affected by the negativity. Thus, the author decided to write \\"Dealing With Disrespect\\" as a free, easy-to-read guide that could help people handle challenging feedback and become better communicators themselves. They wanted to create a resource that could be recommended to anyone who faces demotivating anti-social comments, providing them with tools and guidance to put things into perspective and manage their interactions with haters effectively. In conclusion, the author came up with the idea to write \\"Dealing With Disrespect\\" after witnessing the rise in mean-spirited comments and the negative impact they had on creative minds online due to the growth of the internet and technology empowerment.

Wildlife photographer Pickett Smith is taking photographs of the local flora and fauna as he canoes through a swamp surrounding an island containing the affluent mansion estate of the wealthy and influential Crockett family. Also evident throughout the swamp are numerous indicators of pollution, which Pickett believes are connected to pesticide use on the island plantation. After Clint Crockett accidentally tips over Smith's canoe, he and his sister Karen escort Smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire Crockett family. The grouchy, wheelchair-bound patriarch Jason intends on spending the next day enjoying both the 4th of July and his own birthday celebrations uninterrupted. Due to the mutual dislike of the fauna around the mansion, Jason sends a man named Grover to spray pesticide in order to get rid of the frogs. Pickett later discovers Grover's corpse covered in snakebites in the swamp not far from the house. Despite this warning, Jason continues with his celebrations the next day. Early next morning, Michael Martindale sets out to check on a possible downed telephone line. He accidentally shoots himself in the leg and is rendered immobile by strange white moss hanging down from the surrounding trees. Tarantulas descend from the branches and kill him. Back on the estate, Jason's sister, Iris Martindale sends her son, Kenneth into the greenhouse to collect flowers for a centerpiece. As he gathers the flowers, he fails to notice dozens of tokay geckos entering behind him. The geckos swarm over the stacked shelves, knocking over numerous jars of poisonous chemicals, and the resulting toxic gas asphyxiates him. Seeing the danger posed by the animals, Pickett suggests that everyone should leave the island, but Jason is adamant that nothing will ruin his birthday.

This is especially true for shoes made of leather or suede, but all shoes benefit from being cleaned up before you store them. Even if you’re just storing your shoes for the night, and you’re planning on wearing them again tomorrow, it’s a good idea to clean them before you put them away. Let them dry before storing. Clean leather and suede shoes by brushing off dirt and dust with a soft, non-scratchy brush. Use a special leather or suede cleaner to remove stains. Clean canvas shoes by brushing them off, then using soapy water to clean stains. Wash plastic shoes with soap and water. If you’ve previously been throwing all your boots, heels, and running shoes in one big pile, picking out pairs as you need them, it’s time to sort your shoes. Sorting them by season and purpose will help your closet stay organized and keep your shoes in better condition than if you just toss them all together. Group your heels and other dress shoes together. Plan to store your winter boots and other winter shoes in the same place. Group flip flops, sandals and other summer shoes together. Group your exercise shoes and casual shoes together. Shoes remain in their best condition when they’re not exposed to lots of sunlight or hot or cold temperatures. The best place to store shoes is in a cool, dark closet that doesn’t get excessively warm and stuffy. If you don’t have enough room in your closet, you could store them under your bed or on your bedroom wall. Don’t store shoes in the basement, garage or other places that might get cold in the winter and hot in the summer. The fibers the shoes are made out of could break down over time under these conditions. If you’re going to be storing shoes for a month or longer before you next wear them, stuffing shoes with paper helps them retain their shape. Just make sure it’s acid-free paper, since paper that contains acid can damage shoe materials. Avoid using newsprint, since it could discolor your shoes. Cut up toilet paper rolls also work well. Use shoe trees for your best shoes. If you have a pair of nice leather shoes, store them with shoe trees so they stay in tip-top condition. Shoe trees made out of cedar keep shoes smelling fresh, and they also repel moths and other bugs. Shoe trees are available at shoe stores or online. If you have a nice pair of boots you want to store, use boot stands to keep them upright. If the tops flop over, they could end up with a permanent crease after a few months of storage. If you don’t want to invest in boot stands, try this clever trick: use empty, dry wine bottles to keep your boots upright.

This discovery phase typically begins when an exposed fossil catches the eye of a paleontologist, amateur fossil hunter, or even a lucky member of the public who happens to come across it. Fossils can often be found in areas with exposed rock formations such as quarries, cliffs, and riverbanks, or even in construction sites where large amounts of sediment are being removed. Once a potential fossil is spotted, the process of carefully excavating it begins. Paleontologists employ various tools such as brushes, picks, shovels, and even dental tools to carefully remove the surrounding soil and rock without damaging the fragile fossil. This can be a delicate and time-consuming task, with some excavations lasting weeks, months, or even years. After the fossil is successfully extracted from the ground, the next step is to clean, prepare, and stabilize it for further study and preservation. This process can include removing any remaining matrix (the surrounding rock and soil) through mechanical or chemical means, consolidating fragile parts with glues or resins, and storing the fossil under ideal conditions to prevent damage from factors such as humidity and ultra-violet light. Once the fossil is ready, paleontologists can then study it closely, taking measurements, photographs, and sometimes even making casts or 3D scans to create an accurate digital model. By examining the fossil's morphology, they can gather valuable information about the ancient organism's taxonomy, biology, behavior, and ecology. In some cases, fossils also provide insight into the geological conditions of the area where the organism lived, and the general environment and climate during that time period. This data helps researchers understand the history of life on Earth and the evolution of various organism groups. Finally, the information gathered from studying a fossil is often shared with the scientific community through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences. This allows other scientists to review, discuss, and build upon the findings. The fossil may also be displayed in museums and research institutions, where it can help educate the general public about the history of life on our planet and stimulate further interest in paleontology and natural sciences. In conclusion, the final step of the fossilization process is the discovery and excavation of the fossil, followed by its study, sharing of information, and preservation. This ensures that valuable knowledge about the ancient organisms and their environments can be passed down to future generations, enriching our understanding of the Earth's history and biodiversity."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Solve this instance: Background Paragraph: Regions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7] At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8]. Story: There was a competition for who can get their black drone the highest into the air. Team 10 got it 3,333 ft. Team 11 got it 4,444 ft. Team 12 go it 5,555 ft. Team 13 got it 6,666 ft.

The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter. The very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them. \\"I don't mind telling you,\\" Lenny said, \\"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk. \\"No need to be afraid,\\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \\"The Easter Bunny will provide.\\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been. Question: What is most likely true about Reverend Billy Bunny? === The answer to the above question is Available choices: + He is scared that the drought won't end; + He is hopeful that the drought will be over; + not enough information; + He is happy that the drought is happening; Answer:","output":"He is hopeful that the drought will be over."},{"instruction":"The hollow of the hand or of a tree.

Her college friends Sudha Mathur (Sabeeha) and Sunil (Javed Jaffrey) try to help her sort through her visions but to little avail. Devi is relieved after she talks to her sister and finds that she is alive. However, just some time later, Rama is murdered in the same way as Devi had pictured. The murderer hides Rama's body in a mansion's wall. Rama is reported missing. Devi firmly believes Rama is dead. Five years later, Devi moves to her uncle (Ajit Vachani)'s home where she eventually meets and is courted by millionaire businessman Ram Kumar (Jackie Shroff). Sunil, who was secretly in love with Devi, is deeply disappointed. Devi and Ram marry and enter his family mansion, which he has re-earned after a legal battle. Little known to anybody, this is the same mansion where Rama was buried. When Devi starts having the visions again, Rama's skeleton is not the only thing that will come tumbling out. Devi sees a wall in the mansion being torn down. Devi tears down the wall, only to find a skeleton tumbling out of it. Devi knows whose skeleton it is: it's Rama's, since she had a necklace similar to Devi's. Also, the dead woman's skeleton is roughly same height as that of Rama. The Inspector (Shivaji Satam) quickly points out that since the mansion was closed when Rama disappeared, anyone could have hidden a dead body in there and nobody would know the truth. However, he doubts that the dead woman is Rama: Several such necklaces are available. Devi now gets another vision of another woman getting murdered.

He stepped down from these and other positions by a series of abdications between 1554 and 1556. Through inheritance, he brought together under his rule extensive territories in western, central, and southern Europe, and the Spanish viceroyalties in the Americas and Asia. In August 1558, Charles was taken seriously ill with what was later revealed to be malaria. He died in the early hours of the morning on 21 September 1558, at the age of 58, holding in his hand the cross that his wife Isabella had been holding when she died. Charles was originally buried in the chapel of the Monastery of Yuste, but he left a codicil in his last will and testament asking for the establishment of a new religious foundation in which he would be reburied with Isabella. Following his return to Spain in 1559, their son Philip undertook the task of fulfilling his father's wish when he founded the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. After the Monastery's Royal Crypt was completed in 1574, the bodies of Charles and Isabella were relocated and re-interred into a small vault directly underneath the altar of the famous Basilica of the Monastery, in accordance with Charles's wishes to be buried \\"half-body under the altar and half-body under the priest's feet\\" side by side with Isabella. They remained in this vault until 1654 when they were later moved into the Royal Pantheon of Kings by their great-grandson Philip IV, who, in doing so, disrespected his great-grandfather's wishes. On one side of the Basilica are bronze effigies of Charles and Isabella, with effigies of their daughter Maria of Austria and Charles's sisters Eleanor of Austria and Maria of Hungary behind them.

There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin.

Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - A photograph or photo is an image created by light falling on a light-sensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic medium such as a CCD or a CMOS chip. Most photographs are created using a camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. The process and practice of creating photographs is called photography. The word \\"photograph\\" was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek (\\"phos\\"), meaning \\"light\\", and (\\"graphê\\"), meaning \\"drawing, writing\\", together meaning \\"drawing with light\\". - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Graffiti (plural of \\"graffito\\": \\"a graffito\\", but \\"these graffiti\\") are writing or drawings that have been scribbled, scratched, or painted illicitly on a wall or other surface, often within public view.

It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - Henry Chalfant (born January 2, 1940 in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, United States) is an American photographer and videographer most notable for his work on graffiti, breakdance, and hip hop culture.

A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge.

INSEE, the French Statistical Institute, uses the term \\"unité urbaine\\", which means continuous urbanized area. However, because of differences in definitions of what does and does not constitute an \\"agglomeration\\", as well as variations and limitations in statistical or geographical methodology, it can be problematic to compare different agglomerations around the world. It may not be clear, for instance, whether an area should be considered to be a satellite and part of an agglomeration, or a distinct entity in itself. - Martha Cooper is an American photojournalist born in the 1940s in Baltimore, Maryland.

Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire. - Headquarters (HQ) denotes the location where most, if not all, of the important functions of an organization are coordinated.

The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, the ship that has a distinct advantage over carriers is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that aircraft carriers themselves hold significant advantages over other types of ships due to their ability to launch aircraft that have superior range, flexibility, and effectiveness, as demonstrated by the examples of HMS Illustrious and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. These powerful capabilities fundamentally changed naval combat during World War II, as they allowed for more effective and highly mobile strikes compared to traditional battleships or other naval vessels. That being said, it is important to note that carriers can also be vulnerable when forced into gun-range encounters, as demonstrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious. Nevertheless, the overall advantages provided by aircraft carriers in terms of range and strategic capabilities have made them essential components in modern naval forces."},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.

When the fall quarter began soon thereafter , enrollment nearly doubled that of the previous quarter . The new president worked to prepare the campus for the influx of returning veterans as the college moved from wartime to peacetime conditions . The veterans generally had no interest in joining the corps of cadets , and for the first time , during winter quarter 1946 , civilians outnumbered cadets on campus . With the explosion in civilian students , 3,100 living on campus and another 900 day students came a need for housing . To help resolve the problem for married veterans , the college installed a trailer court that students called Vetsville surrounding the Solitude House , which was converted into a community center to serve the trailer court residents . Two additional trailer courts that students called Cassell Heights after financial and business manager Stuart K. Cassell followed in the area east of present - day Cassell Coliseum .

The Jets' offense got going toward the end of the first quarter with a three-yard touchdown pass from Pennington to Laveranues Coles. The Dolphins responded swiftly as Trent Green and Ronnie Brown led the team on a three-minute drive that culminated on a one-yard run by Brown to tie the score at seven. However, the Jets wasted little time reclaiming the lead. Leon Washington received the ensuing kickoff at the two-yard line and returned it 98&#160;yards for a touchdown and a 14-7 lead. The Dolphins crept back with field goals of 31 and 39&#160;yards by Jay Feely on their next two possessions. Pennington kept the Dolphins at bay with a successful two-minute drill, finding tight end Chris Baker on a four-yard touchdown to close the first half and give the Jets a 21-13 halftime lead. The Jets attempted to further their lead opening the third quarter, but were stopped short of the goal line and had to settle for a 21-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Dolphins tried to respond, but the Jets' defense forced their first takeaway of the season on the ensuing drive, an interception by Kerry Rhodes. Pennington led his offense downfield with the help of several Thomas Jones running plays before he ran into the end zone to give the Jets a 31-13 lead early in the fourth quarter. Miami would not go down quietly, however. Green quickly marched the Dolphins downfield to set up Brown's two-yard touchdown run. The Dolphins elected to attempt a two-point conversion to cut their deficit to ten; using a Statue of Liberty play, Brown walked into the end zone to complete the conversion. Although the Jets shed several minutes off the clock on their following possession, the Dolphins got the ball back and again were able to move swiftly downfield, where Brown scored his third touchdown on a 22-yard pass from Green. The Dolphins needed to recover an onside kick on the ensuing kickoff to have a chance to tie or win the game, but, despite a penalty moving the ball up ten yards, were unsuccessful, and Pennington knelt out the clock to give the Jets their first victory of the season.
