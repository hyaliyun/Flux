Movie plot title: The Adventures of Tartu Movie plot: In 1940, demolition expert Captain Terrence Stevenson, an Englishman born in Romania and educated in Germany, is summoned to the Foreign Office. Because Stevenson knows both Romanian and German fluently, he is asked to go on a mission disguised as Romanian chemical engineer Jan Tartu and destroy a poison gas factory in Czechoslovakia. After parachuting into Romania, \\"Tartu,\\" dressed as a dandy and assuming the air of a gigolo, travels toward Czechoslovakia, pretending to be sympathetic to Germany and wanted by the Romanian people because of it. Arriving in Czechoslavakia, Tartu stops at the shop of his contact, a shoemaker. Before putting Tartu in touch with the underground, the shoemaker is arrested in a Gestapo raid, but Tartu escapes. Wearing a German uniform, Tartu then goes to work at a war materiel plant and is told to keep his eyes open for Czechs who try to stop production. At his hotel, he encounters Marúschka Brunn, a formerly wealthy Czech who fraternizes with the Germans and flaunts her distaste of her own people. One day, a woman is shot for sabotage at the plant and landlady Anna Palacek's daughter Pavla, who works at the plant, arrives at home very upset. When German officers arrive to investigate the death of a fellow officer, Tartu gives her an alibi and hides a gun for her. Pavla and Anna now say that they will do anyting for him and he reveals that he must contact the underground to fulfill a secret mission. A short time later, Marúschka asks to see him and he invites her for dinner at a nightclub. They begin to realize their mutual attraction, and, as he gets to know Marúschka, Tartu deduces that she is really anti-Nazi. In the restaurant's garden, each decides to take a chance on the other. She tells him that she works with Pavla in the underground and will put him in touch with her compatriots. The next day, Pavla is caught in an act of sabotage. Because the Gestapo know that Tartu has seen it, Pavla secretly implores him to save himself and give her away. To fulfill his mission, Tartu... Answer:","output":"In the movie plot of \\"The Adventures of Tartu,\\" several characters come to believe Vogel. Initially, Tartu encounters Marúschka Brunn, who fraternizes with the Germans but later reveals her anti-Nazi sentiments. Marúschka comes to believe Vogel (Tartu) as they share mutual attraction and discuss their true intentions. As Tartu gains Marúschka's trust, she helps him get in touch with the underground resistance movement, which includes Pavla and her mother Anna Palacek.

The Colts took the opening kick and drove to the Patriots 46-yard line, but on 3rd-and-6 Peyton Manning was intercepted by Brandon Meriweather who returned it 39 yards to the Colts 32. Four plays later, Brady threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Welker for an early 7-0 lead. After a Colts punt, the Patriots put together a 15 play, 87-yard drive, culminating with Brady throwing an 8-yard touchdown pass to Hernandez, increasing their lead to 14-0 early in the second quarter. The Colts responded on their next drive, with Manning passing for 62 yards on a 69-yard drive, and scoring on a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Gijon Robinson. Ben Tate returned the ensuing kickoff 32 yards to the Patriots 35, and the Patriots offense continued to stay relentless, marching 65 yards in 8 plays, scoring on a 5-yard run by Green-Ellis, increasing their lead to 21-7. The Colts answered right back, engineering a 12 play, 73-yard drive, scoring on an 11-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Reggie Wayne(who made a fantastic catch) 0:08 left in the first half, trimming the deficit to 21-14. After both teams punted on their first drive of the second half, the Patriots raced 79 yards in just 9 plays, scoring on a 36-yard touchdown burst by Woodhead, extending the lead 28-14 on the only score of the third quarter. On the second play of the Colts next drive, Manning was intercepted by McCourty at the Patriots 39. The Patriots drove to the Colts 7, but the Colts defense held, forcing the Patriots to settle for a 25-yard field goal, widening the lead to 31-14 with 10:27 left in the game. Peyton threw for 66 yards on the ensuing 73-yard drive, including a 5-yard touchdown pass to Blair White, trimming the deficit to 31-21. After forcing a quick three-and-out, with help from an unnecessary roughness penalty on Tully Banta-Cain, the Colts raced 58 yards, with Manning throwing his 4th touchdown of the night, again to White, trimming the deficit to just 31-28 with 4:46 remaining in the game. The Colts forced another quick punt and got the ball at their own 26-yard line with 2:25 remaining, giving Manning a chance to pull off a miracle comeback against the Patriots for a second year in a row. Manning drove the Colts all the way to the Patriots 24-yard line, but was intercepted at by James Sanders at the 6-yard line with 0:37 remaining, giving the Patriots the win.

Step 1: Determine the number of customers who made a purchase. Out of the 100 customers that visited the site, 80% bought something. To find this number, simply multiply 100 by 0.8 (80%): 100 * 0.8 = 80 customers Step 2: Calculate the total revenue generated from the purchases. Since each of the 80 customers bought something that cost 25, we multiply the number of customers by the price of the item to find the total revenue: 80 * 25 = 2,000 Step 3: Calculate the profit. Now we need to subtract the advertising cost from the revenue to determine the profit: Profit = Revenue - Advertising cost Profit = 2,000 - 1,000 Profit = 1,000 So, James gained a profit of 1,000 from the ad."},{"instruction":"How might one describe the sentiment of this review?

Article: For many in the United States,Arab-Americans are an invisible part of the population.Though Arab-Americans as a community have made great contributions to American society in fields from literature to politics to medicine,many Americans know very little about Americans of Arab backgrounds. Arab history in the United States goes back to the late 1800's when large numbers of Arab immigrants first began making their journey to a land known simply as\\"Amreeka\\". Historians generally describe Arab immigration to America in two waves.The first wave took place between 1860 and 1924.The first wave consisted of Lebanese and Syrian,and some Egyptian immigrants.These new immigrants,who were mostly Christian,came to America in search of better opportunities.Even the doomed Titanic,which set sail for America in 1912,had close to a hundred Arab passengers aboard.The majority of Arab-Americans today are descendents of the first wave of immigrants;they are the third or more generation Americans. The second wave of immigrants followed after World War II,caused by political unrest in the Middle East.This second wave of immigrants consists of mainly Arab Muslims and continues to this day. Arab-Americans make up 3 million of the population in the United States,according to demographers.And quite different from popular belief,64 percent of them are American-born.Eighty-two percent of Arab-Americans are US citizens. Arab-Americans are beyond the national average in both education and income.Education is important among Arab-Americans;82 percent have high school diplomas,36 percent have bachelor's degrees or higher,and 15 percent have graduate degrees.The-median average income among Arab-Americans is 39 580,which is higher than the US average.

In the final game Duke made 5 free throws (worth one point), and 4 regular baskets (worth two points), and some three-pointers. Normally, he scores 2 three-pointers a game. How many more three-pointers did he score in the final game compared to his normal amount? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Let's calculate how many points Duke scored in the final game. He needed 17 points to tie the record, and he broke it by 5 points. That means he scored 22 points in that game (17 + 5 = 22). Now, let's calculate the points scored from free throws and regular baskets: - Free throws: 5 x 1 = 5 points - Regular baskets: 4 x 2 = 8 points - Total: 5 + 8 = 13 points So, Duke scored 13 points from free throws and regular baskets. He scored 22 points in the game, which means he scored 9 points from three-pointers (22 - 13 = 9). Now, let's calculate how many three-pointers he scored: - 3-pointers scored: 9 points / 3 points per shot = 3 three-pointers Duke usually scores 2 three-pointers per game, so in the final game, he scored one more three-pointer than his normal amount (3 - 2 = 1)."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: If flashlights help people see, then what helps people see?

In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated to the nation allowing him to sell the original. Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is radically different in feel. The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.In late 1886 this second version was one of nine paintings donated to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in the first instalment of Watts's gift to the nation. Meanwhile, the original was briefly displayed in Nottingham before being sold to the steam tractor entrepreneur Joseph Ruston in 1887. Its whereabouts was long unknown until in 1986 it was auctioned at Sotheby's for £869,000 (about £2,500,000 in 2019 terms), 100 years after its first exhibition.On their donation to the South Kensington Museum, the nine works donated by Watts were hung on the staircase leading to the library, but Hope proved a popular loan to other institutions as a symbol of current British art. At the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887 in Manchester, an entire wall was dedicated to the works of Watts. Hope, only recently completed but already the most famous of Watts's works, was placed at the centre of this display. It was then exhibited at the 1888 Melbourne Centennial Exhibition and the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris, before being moved to Munich for display at the Glaspalast. In 1897 it was one of the 17 Watts works transferred to the newly created National Gallery of British Art (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain);..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The name of the painting whose duplicate was radically different in feel is \\"Hope\\" by George Frederic Watts. In mid-1886, Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the original \\"Hope\\" with the intention to donate it to the nation, while selling the original.

Before coming to this conclusion, I considered the following factors: 1. **Content:** The reviewer reports a positive experience (\\"It helps my apps run smooth\\"), which suggests a degree of satisfaction worth rating above the midpoint. However, the review is not extremely detailed, so it doesn't justify the highest ratings. 2. **Clarity:** The review contains a typing error (\\"helos\\" instead of \\"helps\\"), which obscures the exact meaning slightly and impacts readability. These errors reduce the overall rating I would assign. 3. **Completeness:** Although the reviewer does mention that the product makes apps run smoother, they doesn't go into detail about other aspects of the product.

Make sure that the inside of the box is comfortable and well-ventilated, with proper insulation and drainage to keep the eggs and hatchlings safe from weather elements. Additionally, it is crucial to provide a suitable nesting material, such as soft twigs, grass, and feathers, to cushion and insulate the nest. Monitor the nest from a distance to prevent disturbing the birds and check its cleanliness regularly, removing any soiled or wet materials and replacing them with fresh ones.

Soldiers search for missing people and emergency services clear roads. Dozens stranded after record-breaking rainfall. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Heavy Rain Causes Trouble in South-west Japan Once upon a time in a land called Japan, there was a big storm with lots and lots of rain. The rain fell so much that it broke records, just like when you or I do something better than anyone else ever has before. Because of all this rain, the people living in the south-west part of the country had a really difficult time. You see, when there's too much rain falling from the sky, it can cause lots of problems. One problem was that the roads and houses were damaged or even destroyed. Imagine if you took a whole bunch of toy cars and little houses and dumped a whole bucket of water on them - that's what happened to the real roads and homes in Japan. The people in the affected areas couldn't just clean up their homes and roads all by themselves, so soldiers joined to help them look for anyone who might be missing and make sure they were safe. They were like superheroes, fighting against the trouble caused by the heavy rain. The rain also made it hard for cars and buses to move around since the roads were flooded and had lots of water in them. Think of it like when you're in the bathtub and your toy car gets stuck in the bubbles and can't move. That's what happened to the people on the roads in Japan. Some people were even stranded, like being on a little island surrounded by water and couldn't get back to their homes. Luckily, there were helpful emergency services who came to the rescue. They are like your mom or dad when you need help, but they do it for a whole community. The emergency services worked very hard to clean up all the mess the rain caused and clear a path for people to get moving again. So, although the heavy rain caused lots of trouble in south-west Japan, there were many brave people who came together like a team to help each other out and make things better again.

Stepfather III is the second sequel to 1987 's The Stepfather and concerns the titular serial killer seeking out yet another all - American family to become a part of , using plastic surgery to disguise himself from the authorities . - Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. It includes cosmetic or aesthetic surgery, reconstructive surgery, craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, microsurgery, and the treatment of burns. - A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. Females in many areas of the world have a higher risk related to the more frequent use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people. Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part. Burns are generally preventable. Treatment depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection.... After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'stepfather iii' with the relationship of 'color'. Choices: - black - color - red Answer:","output":"The best answer for the entity that related to 'Stepfather III' with the relationship of 'color' would be 'black.' This is inferred from the information given about burns in the text, specifically third and fourth-degree burns, which are likely connected to the plot of 'Stepfather III' stated in the first paragraph. Recall, the film centers around a serial killer who uses plastic surgery to alter his appearance and assimilate into unsuspecting families. Plastic surgery, as defined in the second paragraph, is a surgical specialty that involves the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. In the context of the film, this can denote surgeries required to treat severe burns. Given that burns are a focus in the text, it's reasonable to connect this topic to the film's context. Particularly, third and fourth-degree burns, which are the most severe, often result in parts of the skin turning black due to injury reaching deeper tissues, muscles, tendons, or bone. Indeed, burns can necessitate intensive cosmetic and reconstructive surgery - a concept central to the film's plot. So, while none of the color options explicitly mentioned in the film's paragraph, the narrative surrounding the character's use of plastic surgery - possibly due to burn injuries - substantiating 'black' as the most accurate answer. On the other hand, 'red' is the color mentioned in relation to first-degree burns only that which are superficial and don't require plastic surgery. Hence, it might not be very relevant to the plot of 'Stepfather III.' The option 'color' is too generic and does not provide any specific relation to the plot mentioned. Therefore, in the context of 'Stepfather III', and given the details provided about plastic surgery and burns - especially the resulting colors of severe burns - it's reasonable to infer that 'black' is the most closely related color option."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: ORLANDO, Florida (41NBC/WMGT) – It’s Day 2 of Bill Shanks’ reports from the Braves spring training facility in Florida.

No Jan showed Austin's picture to them because she loved Austin a lot. Given the question \\"How would you describe Jan?\\", is \\"shy\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Given the context, the answer to whether \\"shy\\" is a valid description for Jan will require a comprehensive analysis. Based on the information provided, we merely know that Jan showed Austin's picture to them, which indicates that she loves Austin. However, this information alone is not sufficient to determine Jan's shyness or lack thereof. To provide a detailed and long answer to your question, let us explore several perspectives derivable from the context: 1. The act of sharing a picture: Jan's choice to show Austin's picture to others already implies that she is open enough to publicly express her feelings. This may suggest that she is not shy in some respects. On the other hand, one could argue that this act could be perceived as shy if she chose to display his image rather than verbally convey her admiration for him. 2. The reason behind sharing the picture: Jan's motivation for sharing the picture is her love for Austin. Demonstrating affection might make some individuals feel vulnerable or self-conscious. In this case, showing Austin's picture to others could be considered a subtle, indirect way of revealing her feelings, which might indicate a level of shyness. 3. The significance of love in the context: The information provided explicitly states that Jan loves Austin a lot. If her love for him brings her out of her comfort zone and compels her to share his picture openly, it may suggest that she is typically shy. However, Austin's significance in her life encourages her to overcome her shyness temporarily. In summary, concluding whether \\"shy\\" is a valid description of Jan based on the given information is not straightforward. The act of sharing Austin's picture might indicate that she is not particularly shy in that circumstance. However, we lack sufficient context and knowledge of her overall behavior to determine if \\"shy\\" serves as an accurate descriptor for Jan. Therefore, without more information, it is impossible to definitively answer whether \\"shy\\" is a valid characterization or not."},{"instruction":"Which real life law enforcer did Henry Fonda play in the film My Darling Clementine?","output":"In order to find out which real-life law enforcer Henry Fonda portrayed in the film My Darling Clementine, I will perform the following steps: Step 1: Search for the movie My Darling Clementine to gather information about its cast and characters.

They are often credited with taking the first steps toward popularizing grunge music, and have continued to achieve critical and commercial success in the new millennium, with bands such as Fleet Foxes, Foals, Beach House, The Postal Service, Flight of the Conchords, Sleater-Kinney, Blitzen Trapper, No Age, Wolf Parade and The Shins on their roster. In 1995 the owners of Sub Pop sold a 49% stake of the label to the Warner Music Group. - Jack Endino (born 1964) is an American producer and musician based in Seattle, United States. Long associated with Seattle label Sub Pop and the grunge movement, Endino worked on seminal albums from bands such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, and Nirvana. Endino was also the guitarist for the Seattle band Skin Yard which was active between 1985 and 1992. Endino has maintained a down-to-earth and humorous website since 1997, and currently manages a studio in Seattle called Soundhouse Recording. - Skin Yard was an American grunge band from Seattle, Washington, who were active from 1985 to 1993. The group never gained a mainstream audience, but were an influence on several of their grunge contemporaries, including Soundgarden, Screaming Trees, The Melvins, and Green River. - Blues rock is a fusion genre combining elements of blues and rock. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock. From its beginnings in the early- to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way inspired hard rock, Southern rock, and heavy metal. Blues rock continues to be an influence, with performances and recordings by several popular artists. - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Highlights and Lowlives is the eighth studio album by American rock band Blue Cheer , released in 1990 and produced by Jack Endino . - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals. - \\"Summertime Blues\\" is a song co-written and recorded by American rockabilly artist Eddie Cochran. It was written by Cochran and his manager Jerry Capehart. Originally a single B-side, it was released in August 1958 and peaked at number 8 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 on September 29, 1958 and number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. It has been covered by many artists, including being a number-one hit for country music artist Alan Jackson, and scoring notable hits in versions by The Who and Blue Cheer. Jimi Hendrix performed it in concert. - Stoner rock or stoner metal is a musical subgenre which combines elements of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, acid rock, doom metal, and blues rock. The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \\"stoner rock\\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \\"desert rock.\\" Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \\"retro\\" production. The genre emerged during the early-1990s and was pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. - Soundgarden is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984 by singer and rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell, lead guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. Matt Cameron became the band's full-time drummer in 1986, while bassist Ben Shepherd became a permanent replacement for Yamamoto in 1990. - Blue Cheer was an American rock band that initially performed and recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was sporadically active until 2009. Based in San Francisco, Blue Cheer played in a psychedelic blues rock style, and are also credited as being some of the earliest pioneers of heavy metal, with their cover of \\"Summertime Blues\\" sometimes cited as the first in the genre. They have also been noted as influential in the development of genres as disparate as punk rock, stoner rock, doom metal, experimental rock, and grunge. - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'highlights and lowlives' exhibits the relationship of 'genre'. Find the answer from the choices below. Choices: - acid rock - alternative rock - blues - blues rock - concert - country - country music - doom metal - fusion - grunge - heavy metal - heavy metal music - music - musical - pop - punk rock - rhythm - rock - rockabilly - song - stoner rock A:","output":"According to the information provided, the album \\"Highlights and Lowlives\\" by American rock band Blue Cheer exhibits a relationship to the genre of \\"rock\\". Specifically, it's noted that Blue Cheer played in a psychedelic blues rock style and is credited as being pioneers of heavy metal. Although \\"rock\\" is a broad term and doesn't specify the band's unique sound, in this context it would be the most accurate category from the given choices. The band's music appears to encompass elements from several sub-genres of rock, including blues rock, heavy metal, and possibly stoner rock, considering their influential role in its development. \\"Highlights and Lowlives\\" was produced by Jack Endino, who is heavily associated with the grunge scene through his work with Sub Pop, a record label known for signing grunge bands. However, there is no direct indication from the provided information that the album \\"Highlights and Lowlives\\" itself is in the grunge genre. Thus, referring to it simply as \\"rock\\" seems to be the safest bet. It's also worthwhile noting that music genres are often fluid, and many bands and their works can be accurately described as belonging to multiple genres at once. Particularly for a pioneering band like Blue Cheer, their music may not neatly fit into just one category. Furthermore, as 'rock' is a parent genre of many other sub-genres, it covers all the aspects of the mentioned music style of Blue Cheer in this context. Therefore, considering all the information and possible relationships, the most fitting genre for 'Highlights and Lowlives' would be 'rock'."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: – A bit of x-rated architecture has the Louvre worrying about the potential corruption of young minds.

It was supposed to be unveiled in the the Louvre's Tuileries Garden on Oct. 19. But museum director Jean-Luc Martinez became concerned the piece \\"risks being misunderstood by visitors.\\" The Louvre was also worried about the placing of \\"Domestikator\\" near a playground. Le Monde, as quoted by the Kansas City Star, describes how a building could elicit such a response: \\"The work evokes a couple in doggy style. Stylized, of course, Lego way, but nevertheless explicit.\\" \\"This is something that should not happen,\\" Joep van Lieshout tells the Times. \\"A museum should be an open place for communication.\\" The piece is supposed to represent “the power of humanity over the world and its hypocritical approach to nature,\\" and the founder of Atelier Van Lishout says it's not even all that explicit. \\"There are no genitals; it's pretty innocent,\\" he says. He also calls concerns about the effect of \\"Domestikator\\" on children \\"total hypocrisy,\\" telling the Sun that school groups took trips to see it during its three years on exhibit in Germany. \\"If children see something as sexual, it is because they are old enough to see it,\\" Lieshout says. And if you see something sexual, it's because \\"Domestikator\\" has found a museum more accepting of the love between a building and another building.","output":"Title: The Louvre's Rejection of \\"Domestikator\\" Sparks Debate on Art Censorship and X-Rated Architecture Introduction: The Louvre Museum in Paris has created a stir with its recent decision not to display the controversial artwork \\"Domestikator\\" by Dutch art collective Atelier Van Lishout. The 40-foot-tall installation was slated for unveiling in the Tuileries Garden on October 19 but was pulled from the exhibition due to concerns over inappropriate content and potential corruption of young minds. Body: 1. The Controversial Content - Domestikator has been described by Le Monde, as quoted by The Kansas City Star, as a building styled to evoke a couple engaged in a doggy-style position. The artwork is stylized and lacks explicit details such as genitals, but its suggestive nature raised eyebrows among decision-makers at the Louvre. 2. The Museum Director's Concerns - Jean-Luc Martinez, museum director of the Louvre, cited concerns that the piece \\"risks being misunderstood by visitors.\\" The location of the installation, near a playground, further fueled worries about the artwork's potential impact on impressionable young viewers. 3. Atelier Van Lishout Responds - Joep van Lieshout, the founder of Atelier Van Lishout, expressed his disappointment in the decision, stating that, \\"A museum should be an open place for communication.\\" He argued that the artwork was not explicit and actually represents “the power of humanity over the world and its hypocritical approach to nature.\\" Lieshout decried the Louvre's decision as \\"total hypocrisy\\" and pointed out that the artwork had been displayed for three years in Germany without controversy. 4. The Debate over Art Censorship and the Role of Museums - This decision by the Louvre has reignited debates about art censorship and the responsibilities of museums. Should they act as a platform for open discussion and creativity, or should they take on the role of gatekeeper, deciding what is appropriate for public consumption? 5. The Impact on the Art World and Society - Some argue that by censoring such artwork, museums may be limiting the creative expression of artists and the public's access to diverse perspectives. Conversely, others maintain that it is important to establish boundaries to protect vulnerable and impressionable visitors from artwork that may be seen as inappropriate or offensive. Conclusion: The Louvre's decision to not display Domestikator has generated heated discussions about the balance between creative freedom and the responsibility of art institutions to their audiences. While some believe that the artwork is a powerful statement on humanity's relationship with the natural world, others argue that the suggestive nature of the piece is inappropriate for a public setting. Ultimately, the debate raises important questions about the role of museums in society and the evolving nature of creative expression."},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: It wants them to 'be based on the principles of liberalised and open markets and reciprocity of investment rights between the partners, and therefore demand that, in exchange for close and beneficial economic ties, the Russian Government guarantee the property rights of foreign investors'.","output":"\\"Se haluaa niiden 'perustuvan liberalisoitujen ja avoimien markkinoiden periaatteisiin ja investointioikeuksien vastavuoroisuuteen kumppaneiden välillä, ja vaatiivat siten, että venäläinen hallitus takaa ulkomaisten sijoittajien omaisuusoikeudet' vaihdossa tiiviistä ja hyödyllisistä taloudellisista yhteyksistä.\\" Tämä tarkoittaa, että he haluavat kaiken toimivan reilusti ja oikeudenmukaisesti.

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.

It is surrounded by constellations like Aquarius, Capricornus, Grus, Microscopium, and Sculptor. To understand its location, we'll look at some key aspects such as its coordinates, when and where to observe it, and its celestial neighbors. Coordinates and position: Piscis Austrinus is situated at right ascension 22 hours 12.8 minutes and declination -30.25 degrees in the southern sky. Right ascension (RA) is the celestial equivalent of longitude, while declination (Dec) is similar to latitude. When and where to observe: To view Piscis Austrinus, the best time of year is around September when it reaches its highest point in the sky. Observers in the southern hemisphere have the advantage of seeing it high overhead, while it appears lower to those in the northern hemisphere. For observers in the United States, Europe, and similar latitudes in the northern hemisphere (between 30° and 50° North), Piscis Austrinus can be seen low in the southern sky. From the equator, the constellation appears high up in the sky, while it appears overhead for viewers in the southern hemisphere at latitudes between 30° and 50° South. As an example, to view it from New York City (latitude 40° N), search for Piscis Austrinus low in the southern sky during September evenings. Celestial neighbors: Piscis Austrinus shares borders with the following constellations: 1. Aquarius: This constellation, whose name means \\"water-bearer,\\" is one of the oldest recognized constellations and is usually depicted as a man pouring water from a jar. Aquarius can be found to the north of Piscis Austrinus. 2. Capricornus: This constellation is to the northwest of Piscis Austrinus and is one of the twelve zodiac constellations. Capricornus, also known as the Sea-Goat, represents a mythical creature possessing the front part of a goat and the tail of a fish. 3. Grus: Located to the southeast of Piscis Austrinus, Grus is a constellation that represents a crane, a large, long-legged bird. Grus was first cataloged by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century. 4. Microscopium: To the southwest of Piscis Austrinus lies Microscopium, a small constellation that represents a microscope, one of the 17th-century inventions. 5. Sculptor: This constellation, found to the east of Piscis Austrinus, is named after the sculptor's studio and was introduced by the French astronomer Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century. In conclusion, knowing the coordinates, the ideal time to view Piscis Austrinus, and its neighboring constellations can help you locate this constellation in the night sky. For best visibility, viewers should also choose a dark location away from light pollution and use a star map or astronomy app to aid their observations."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article in one sentence.

Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early.

Casualties were reported Sunday, but reliable estimates were impossible to ascertain. Until now, Ethiopian officials had denied that they had any combat forces inside Somalia, saying instead that their involvement was limited to a few hundred military advisers. Over the past few months, the Islamist clerics in Somalia have threatened Ethiopia for supporting their rivals, the internationally recognized transitional government. On Saturday, after several days of heavy internal fighting, Islamist leaders announced that Somalia was now open to Muslim fighters around the world who wanted to wage a holy war against Ethiopia, a country with a long Christian history, even though it is about half Muslim. “What did you expect us to do?” said Zemedkun Tekle, a spokesman for Ethiopia’s information ministry. “Wait for them to attack our cities?” Even before Ethiopia’s escalation on Sunday, there were alarming signs that the conflict in Somalia could quickly spiral out of control. According to United Nations officials, at least 2,000 soldiers from Eritrea, which recently waged war with Ethiopia, are fighting for the Islamists. They have been joined by a growing number of Muslim mercenaries from Yemen, Egypt, Syria and Libya who want to turn Somalia into the third front of holy war, after Iraq and Afghanistan. On Friday, residents of Mogadishu said they saw boatloads of armed men landing on the city’s rocky beaches. On Sunday, after the bombings, Islamist leaders boasted of bringing in more. Still, from the Ethiopian government’s viewpoint, the bombings may be delivering at least some of the desired effect. For the first time since the Islamists came to power in Somalia in June and rapidly began expanding their reach, they seemed to be losing ground. In at least three places on Sunday — Idaale, Jawil and Bandiiradley — transitional government troops were pushing the Islamists back. Residents of Beledweyne, near the Ethiopian border, said that after the Ethiopian jets pounded several armed pickup trucks belonging to the Islamists, the rest of the Islamist soldiers fled to the hills. The bombs also destroyed a recruitment center and a fuel depot, killing at least 10 people, witnesses reported. Hours later, the transitional troops marched into the area, and a new mayor was installed. Many of Beledweyne’s people seemed relieved, not so much about the change in government, but because the fighting appeared to have ended so fast. “We’re so sick of war,” said Ahmed Issa, a shopkeeper in Beledweyne. “We’ll obey anybody.” Much of Somalia has been mired in anarchy since 1991, when the central government collapsed, setting off a long, nasty interclan war. While the United Nations and donor countries struggled to get a new government on its feet, a grass-roots movement of Islamic courts began to gain power. After Islamist leaders defeated the last of Mogadishu’s warlords, they immediately restored a sense of law and order unheard of in the capital for 15 years. Then they began pushing outward, eventually reaching the outskirts of Baidoa, the seat of the transitional government. The transitional government has never been popular, and its military forces are divided between rival politicians, many of whom spend the majority of their time outside of Somalia. This summer, Ethiopia began slipping soldiers across the border to protect both the transitional government and Ethiopia itself. The Islamists had threatened to liberate Somali-speaking areas of Ethiopia and stir up Ethiopia’s Muslim population. American officials acknowledged that they tacitly supported Ethiopia’s approach because they felt it was the best way to check the growing power of the Islamists, whom American officials have accused of sheltering terrorists tied with Al Qaeda. A State Department spokesperson in Washington said Sunday that the United States was assessing reports of the surge in fighting in Somalia but provided no further comment. A major question going forward seems to be whether Ethiopian forces will advance into Mogadishu and try to finish off the Islamist military, a possibility that many fear could spur a long and ugly insurgency, or simply deal the Islamists enough of a blow to force them back to negotiations with the transitional government. The rival authorities in Somalia have flirted with the idea of sharing power, but several rounds of peace talks have produced little but broken promises. In a hint of a possible direction to come, Ethiopia’s prime minister recently told American officials that he could wipe out the Islamists “ in one to two weeks.” But many analysts fear that the presence of Ethiopian troops in Somalia will only make matters worse, because of the history of conflict between Ethiopians and Somalis. The two nations have battled over contested border areas before, and the difference of religions, with Somalia almost purely Muslim, has often been an aggravating factor. On Sunday, as word began to spread that Ethiopian planes were bombing Somalia, students in Mogadishu rushed into the streets and began rioting. They kicked in doors and smashed plate glass windows, yelling at the few shopkeepers still open: “This is not time for business! This is time for war!” The Islamists are using teenagers as their main fighting force. Last week, right after heavy combat began between the Islamist troops and the transitional government forces, Islamist leaders closed all schools in Mogadishu to funnel more young people into battle. Witnesses in frontline areas have said that waves of young, poorly trained Islamist fighters have been mowed down by Ethiopian troops. Ethiopia’s military is trained by American advisers and is supplied with millions of dollars of American aid. On Sunday, Abdulrahim Ali Modei, the Islamists’ information minister, conceded at a news conference that many of the Islamist troops had been killed, but he did not sound discouraged. “These are victories,” he said. “Our soldiers are in paradise now.” Yussuf Maxamuud and Mohammed Ibrahim contributed reporting from Mogadishu, Somalia.

There are fears that the conflict could spiral out of control, with Eritrean soldiers and Muslim mercenaries from other nations joining the fight to turn Somalia into a new front for a holy war. The US has tacitly supported Ethiopia's approach thus far, as it sees it as a way to curb the growing power of the Islamists.

Plot: One night, Liz, burdened by a recent unsolved murder case in her city that has paralyzed the community with fear, decides to stop off at a strip club. On the surface, it's an odd place for Liz to fetch a drink, but she has a theory. Liz believes in exploring the unbeaten paths and going beyond conventional wisdom to find the naked truth. This includes the strip club, a place overlooked as the breeding ground for sinister plots due to its surface portrayal. She connects the dots between an increase in crime and this club run by a powerful and shady individual, known as Scar. Upon receiving an anonymous tip from a source, citing Scar's possible involvement with the unsolved murder, Liz decides to take the risk. The strip club becomes her temporary solace, a place she visits under the facade of a regular patron enjoying a drink, all while keeping her true intention hidden. Her first encounters at the club are uneventful. However, Liz's persistent visits and sharp observation reveal unusual patterns. She notices that girls employed at the club often disappear for a short duration mid-shift and return looking fearful and distressed. More unsettling is the fact that no one seems to question this strange behavior. Simultaneously, Liz forms an unexpected alliance with Ruby, a stripper at the club who's also nursing dreams of escaping the club's gritty reality. Ruby, too, feels that something is amiss at the club and yearns for a way out. One night, while Liz is sat at the bar, nursing her drink, Ruby drops a key and a note saying, \\"The truth is in the basement.\\" Trusting her instincts and Ruby, Liz ventures into the dimly-lit basement after hours. There she discovers a clandestine underground business of drug trafficking and illegal weapons trade, led by Scar. In a horrifying realization, she also uncovers that the murder victim had worked at the strip club and had been ousted when she threatened to expose this secret. With this newfound evidence, Liz is now in a race against time to expose Scar and his gruesome business whilst making sure that both she and Ruby gets out alive. Besieged by danger at every turn, Liz uses her cunning and resilience to gather the evidence she needs and relies on her allies to unmask the insidious operations in front of the public and authorities, leading to Scar's arrest. As the curtain falls, Liz is once again seated at the strip club, a reminder of the journey she took. Not just to uncover a story, but the discovery of her courage and will to act against all odds. Liberated now from the clutches of Scar, the strip club is no longer a den of crime, but just another quiet place where people like Liz can stop for a drink. Last Call at Midnight, an engrossing thriller, is a tale of fear and redemption, courage and truth, all revolving around Liz's pursuit of justice ignited by a simple question, \\"What does Liz stop off at the strip club for?\\" A drink turned out to be more than just a drink; it was the key to unraveling the chilling truth that linked the strip club to a web of dark secrets and crime. A testament that sometimes, the pursuit of truth leads to unexpected places."},{"instruction":"yesterday 01:02 txxx big tits, double penetration, fake This is all lower case.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US? - not enough information - Many individuals have varying opinions regarding what should be done about the shootings in the US. - It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. - Most of the citizens that own guns feel threatened about the notion of new laws calling for gun control. A:","output":"The politics regarding gun rights in the United States is heavily divided and contested among citizens and politicians. There are varying opinions on what should be done about the shootings in the US, and debates often center around issues of individual rights, public safety, and the role of government in regulating firearms. The Second Amendment plays a crucial role in these discussions as it guarantees the right to bear arms and has been interpreted in different ways over time. On one hand, there are those who advocate for tighter gun control measures, such as background checks for all firearm purchases, stricter regulations on certain types of weapons, and increased support for mental health services to prevent potential gun violence. This group generally includes Democrats, gun control advocates, and various public safety organizations. On the other hand, there are those who believe in preserving and expanding gun rights, arguing that restrictions on firearms infringe upon constitutional rights and that armed citizens can deter crime and protect themselves and others. This group typically includes Republicans, gun rights advocates, and organizations such as the National Rifle Association (NRA). The debate over gun rights and gun control in the US often results in polarized opinions and legislative stalemates, as both sides passionately argue their perspectives. Due to the strong cultural and historical ties to firearms in the US, new gun control legislation can be perceived as a threat to individual rights and freedoms by some citizens, resulting in fierce opposition and resistance to change."},{"instruction":"Student: Test for natural language inference.

For a long time, I thought it was me. I thought maybe it was my age. After reading every book and article I could find on sex, relationships, and marriage, I started to wonder if maybe it wasn’t me. Maybe it was my marriage, maybe it was my husband. I never wanted to be “that woman“. The one that screwed around on her husband. But, I had an affair about six or seven years ago. It didn’t last long. But, that’s when I knew my marriage was over. It wasn’t a lack of sexual desire, it was a lack of desire for my husband. I didn’t want him or the marriage. There was nothing wrong with my sex drive. I told my husband that I’d had an affair. He changed for about a month or so. He was very loving and attentive. But it didn’t last. He loves differently than I need to be loved and it’s just not in him to love me that way. A few months after I ended the affair, I got involved with someone else. I know. I shouldn’t have. I’ve experienced things with this other man that I never thought possible. Felt things I thought were only possible in movies. He’s a romantic. Not flowers or candy or jewellery, but he talks and listens. He hears me. He tries to understand me and give me what I need. Deep, intimate conversations. Looking into one another’s eyes. Soft caresses. Words of adoration. These things he gives me almost daily. I never knew I needed romance because I’d never had it. This is how I need to be loved. After having felt this way, I can’t stay in my marriage. It’s not fair to either of us. I’m not sure what happened. Did we grow apart? Did one or both of us change?

Today, they are scheduled to take an inventory of all the tanning salon's products and equipment. Step 1: Gather necessary materials To ensure the inventory process goes smoothly, Elena takes the initiative to gather the required materials. She collects a clipboard, a pen and a printed spreadsheet. These will help them keep track of the items they count and write down any observations on the document. Step 2: Divide work between Elena and Natalie To make the process more efficient, Elena divides the work between herself and Natalie. She assigns sections of the tanning salon to each person, making sure Natalie handles the sections she is more familiar with to avoid any confusion. Step 3: Start counting and recording inventory Elena and Natalie each start counting and recording the inventory in their respective sections. They take note of the number of tanning beds, bottles of tanning lotion, goggles, towels, and other equipment, as well as the condition of these items. Step 4: Verify and cross-check Once both of them have finished counting their sections, they switch places to verify each other's counts. This ensures that no items are missed and helps minimize any errors. Step 5: Prepare for discrepancies Elena, with her experience, knows that discrepancies may happen during inventory checks. She explains to Natalie that they need to reconcile any differences by double-checking the count and investigating the cause if the discrepancies persist. Step 6: Note any maintenance or cleaning issues While they are taking inventory, Elena and Natalie also keep an eye out for any maintenance or cleaning issues they may encounter. This includes spotting stained towels, broken equipment, or unclean surfaces. Step 7: Compile and analyze results Once they have finished and cross-checked their counts, Elena and Natalie work together to compile the results. They analyze the data, identifying any trends or concerns that may require further attention from management. This could include an unexpectedly low stock of certain items or recurring maintenance issues. Step 8: Report findings to management Finally, Elena and Natalie present their inventory findings to the salon's management. They provide a detailed report, highlighting any areas of concern and suggesting possible solutions. Throughout the entire inventory process, Elena patiently guides Natalie and provides her with tips on how to handle different situations they encounter. By working together and learning from each other, Elena and Natalie efficiently complete the inventory task while strengthening their professional relationship."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry.

Context: Dara and Jody sat on the sun-scorched concrete with their backs against the bus shelter. They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that. Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him. At the end of the lesson Jody was packing her stuff up and didn't know what to do with the bottle of white-out, so she tossed it out the window of the classroom. Dara had seen her do it, and thought it was just so cool. Jody had done it not in the hope of getting attention, because no one was paying attention, they were all packing up their own crap as fast as possible; she'd just done it. Question: After the end of the story Answer: A:","output":"At the end of the story, Dara and Jody's newfound friendship continues to grow stronger and more genuine. They are now bonded by their shared experience of laughter and the secret adventure of skipping school together. Although they initially come from different social scenes at school, their connection defies previous peer group boundaries and exclusivities. As a result, their social horizons expand, and they start mingling with different groups and learning from one another. Over time, their shared experiences and adventurous spirit lead to numerous other adventures and memories, making the story of the day they wagged school just the beginning of a deep and lasting friendship. Dara starts to feel more confident as she steps outside of her comfort zone and experiences new things, thanks to Jody's influence. Similarly, Jody is able to see the importance of meaningful connections with friends, as she begins to be more genuine—not seeking attention, but acting authentically, as she did when she casually tossed the correction fluid out the window. Both Dara and Jody have a profound impact on each other's lives and personalities, as they open up to one another and embrace their differences. They come to appreciate the various facets of their lives that set them apart from one another, forming a strengthened bond. The story serves as a testimony to the power of genuine friendships transcending diverging social backgrounds and the various adventures and memories that can emerge from such connections."},{"instruction":"Apple stock jumps following analyst report Apple Computer stock hit a four-year high today following the release of a report from Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster, who expects Apple's stock price to hit 100.

The district contains 4 cities/towns and 12 communes (a total of 24 localities, including small villages/hamlets): - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - Tîrnauca (Romanian \\"Ternivka\\", , \\"Ternovka\\") is a commune and village in the Slobozia District of Transnistria, Moldova, situated on the east bank of the river Dniester, between Tighina and Tiraspol. It is notable for being home to the largest bottle-shaped building in the world, the Butylka hotel and museum. - A is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features a large number of extremely small \\"rooms\\" (capsules) intended to provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require the services offered by more conventional hotels. - Tiraspol (Russian and ) is internationally recognised as the second largest city in Moldova, but is effectively the capital and administrative centre of the unrecognised Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria). The city is located on the eastern bank of the Dniester River. Tiraspol is a regional hub of light industry, such as furniture and electrical goods production. - Butylka ( Russian for bottle ) is the name of a museum and hotel , sometimes also called the Spirit Museum Hotel . It is located in the village Tîrnauca ( Ternovka ) , 10 km from Tiraspol , the capital of Transnistria . The museum is notable for being housed inside a five - story structure shaped like a giant bottle . It is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest building in the world in the shape of a bottle . The museum features owner Grigory Korzun 's vast collection of liquor . - The Dniester River, or Dnister River ( translit. \\"Dnister\\", , ) is a river in Eastern Europe.

Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a fridge and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flatscreen television and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours. In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities. - A bottle is a rigid container with a neck that is narrower than the body and a mouth. By contrast, a jar has a relatively large mouth or opening which may be as wide as the overall container. Bottles are often made of glass, clay, plastic, aluminium or other impervious materials, and typically used to store liquids such as water, milk, soft drinks, beer, wine, cooking oil, medicine, shampoo, ink, and chemicals. A device applied in the bottling line to seal the mouth of a bottle is termed an external bottle cap, closure, or internal stopper. A bottle can also be sealed by a conductive \\"innerseal\\" by using induction sealing. - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public. - Transnistria (Moldovan: ), officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR ); also called Transdniester, Trans-Dniestr, Transdniestria, or Pridnestrovie, is a self-proclaimed republic on a strip of land between the River Dniester and the border with Ukraine, recognised only by three non-United Nations (UN) states. The region is considered by the UN to be part of Moldova. The PMR controls most of the territory to the east of the River Dniester, and also the city of Bender and its surrounding localities on the west bank, in the historical region of Bessarabia. - Moldova (or sometimes ), or Moldavia, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The capital city is Chiinu. - Bessarabia (; \\"Bessarabiya\\"; \\"Besarabiya\\") is a historical region in Eastern Europe, bounded by the Dniester river on the east and the Prut river on the west. Today Bessarabia is mostly occupied by modern-day Moldova, with the Ukrainian Budjak region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian Chernivtsi Oblast covering a small area in the north. - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively.

Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. - Clay is a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter. Clays are plastic due to their water content and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying or firing. Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure. Depending on the soil's content in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red. Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 45 m, and colloid chemists use 1 m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 m and silt particles as being larger. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. What entity does 'butylka ' has the relation 'country' with?

Pierre Haski reports at Rue 89: Sunday, Palm Sunday in Catholic tradition, the protesters were more aggressive: two people managed to get into the museum and to strike at art works with hammers that they concealed in their clothing. No one was arrested at the time, but, according to the director of the museum, who was interviewed on France Culture [a radio station], two people had already been identified from photos taken at Saturday’s protest and are being sought by the police. One of the works they destroyed was Andres Serrano’s 1987 photograph “Piss Christ,” which, Haski writes, was “displayed two years ago at the Pompidou Center without making waves.” But, of course, Paris isn’t Avignon—the seat of the papacy in the fourteenth century. The organization behind the protest, Civitas (“for a Catholic city”), expressly seeks “the restoration of the social reign of Jesus Christ over civil society.” In 1989, Serrano’s photograph became an object of national controversy here when it was shown in an exhibit in North Carolina. At the time, I was working as an editorial factotum to Edward de Grazia, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law, as he was completing his magisterial book about the recent history of censorship (mainly) in the United States, “Girls Lean Back Everywhere.” He discusses the controversy in the book. Serrano and his work were denounced on the floor of Congress by New York’s Senator Alfonse D’Amato and by North Carolina’s Senator Jesse Helms (“I do not know Mr. Andres Serrano, and I hope I never meet him because he is not an artist, he is a jerk”). It resulted in funding cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts, which had partially financed the show in which the photo was included—as well as in a bill to prevent the N.E.A. from funding art works that “denigrate the objects or beliefs of the adherents of a particular religion or nonreligion.” But the photograph wasn’t destroyed. I’m reminded of the difference between screenings of Jean-Luc Godard’s “Hail Mary” in France in January, 1985 (advance screenings there were interrupted by protesters who threw stink bombs, and a reel of the film was stolen from a projection booth), and its screening here at the New York Film Festival later that year (protesters arrived by the busload and blocked the streets in front of Alice Tully Hall, but the police cordoned off a corridor to allow ticket-holders to pass, and the screening took place unimpeded). In 1988, movie theatres in France showing Martin Scorsese’s film “The Last Temptation of Christ” were vandalized—including by Molotov cocktail and tear gas—and spectators were assaulted by Catholic fundamentalists. ||||| Image caption There had been protests against the work the day before the attack A controversial photograph of a crucifix bathed in urine has been vandalised at an art museum in southern France, officials said. The work, Piss Christ, by American artist Andres Serrano, was attacked on Sunday by three vandals who also threatened staff at the museum in Avignon. A demonstration against the photograph drew some 800 protesters on Saturday. The work also proved contentious in the US when it was first displayed in 1989. Protests Police said two people had attempted to enter the Collection Lambert art museum on Sunday morning with paint spray and a chisel in their jackets. As a guard was removing the items, a third person took a hammer to the work, according the Associated Press. The museum said in a statement the vandals physically threatened three guards before fleeing. A second work, The Church, the torso of a nun with her hands in her lap, was also damaged. On Saturday, a right-wing group held a protest to denounce the photograph as blasphemous and to call for its removal. One museum worker told Reuters news agency they had received death threats by phone. \\"We're nervous and we have asked for protection from the police,\\" the employee said. The museum said the exhibition, entitled I Believe In Miracles, would be open as usual on Tuesday with the damaged works on show. ||||| Summary:","output":"A controversial artwork, \\"Piss Christ\\" by American artist Andres Serrano, was destroyed during a protest by Catholic activists at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Avignon, France. The 1987 photograph which depicts a crucifix bathed in urine, has been a subject of controversy since its creation. The protesters managed to enter the museum on Palm Sunday and struck the artwork with hammers they had concealed in their clothing. The director of the museum stated that two people had already been identified from photos taken at Saturday's protest and are being sought by the police. The organization behind the protest, Civitas, seeks \\"the restoration of the social reign of Jesus Christ over civil society.\\" In 1989, the photograph sparked outrage when it was shown in an exhibit in North Carolina and led to funding cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts, which had partially financed the show in which the photo was included. However, this is the first time the photograph has been physically destroyed. This event highlights the ongoing debate over the line between artistic expression and the potential for offense to religious beliefs."},{"instruction":"We Are Ever So Clean is the first album by Blossom Toes.It is listed in Record Collector’s 100 Greatest Psychedelic Records.Richie Unterberger: One of the happiest most underappreciated relics of British psychedelia Given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the paragraph belong to?","output":"The paragraph belongs to the \\"album\\" category."},{"instruction":"The answer to the question: What is the last name of the scholar that believes role-doublings were used in the performance of the Montverdi piece? is inside the article: In his personaggi listed in the 1609 score, Monteverdi unaccountably omits La messaggera (the Messenger), and indicates that the final chorus of shepherds who perform the moresca (Moorish dance) at the opera's end are a separate group (che fecero la moresca nel fine). Little information is available about who sang the various roles in the first performance. A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer Francesco Rasi took part, and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role. Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges \\"with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling\\". The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato, Giovanni Gualberto Magli, is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes. Magli sang the prologue, Proserpina and possibly one other role, either La messaggera or Speranza. The musicologist and historian Hans Redlich mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo.A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to \\"that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince's Orfeo\\". This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo Bacchini, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits. Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows, a total of ten singers—three sopranos, two altos, three tenors and two basses—is required for a performance, with the soloists (except Orfeo) also forming the chorus. Carter's suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza., can you guess it ?","output":"The scholar who believes that role-doublings were used in the performance of Claudio Monteverdi's piece is Tim Carter. His views are contained within analysis of Monteverdi's 1609 score, specifically relating to the roles in the first performance. In his detailed examination of Monteverdi's work, Carter recognized that there was an unusual absence of a character (La messaggera) and identified that the final group of shepherds performing the moresca (Moorish dance) were a separate entity. With minimal information available about the actual performers involved in the piece's first performance, Carter has drawn upon other historical sources, including a letter written in 1612, to speculate on the roles taken by singers involved in the premiere. This letter suggests that the renowned tenor and composer Francesco Rasi was thought to have taken the title role. Carter's research also points to the involvement of the Florentine castrato, Giovanni Gualberto Magli, who is thought to have taken on multiple roles, including the Prologue, Proserpina and either La messaggera or Speranza. However, he corrects the previously held view of musicologist and historian Hans Redlich, who incorrectly assigned Magli to perform as Orfeo. Further insight into the character selection comes from a 1608 letter, which suggests a castrato priest known as Padre Girolamo Bacchini took on the role of Euridice. Carter believes two well-known Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola, likely portrayed minor roles during the performance. From his meticulous scrutiny, he was able to determine that there were solo roles for four shepherds and three spirits. Through this information, he proposes that a total of ten singers, split amongst three sopranos, two altos, three tenors, and two basses, would have performed the piece, with all but Orfeo also contributing as part of the chorus. He hypothesises that the doubling of roles was possible within the text, suggesting potential pairings such as La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina, and La messaggera with Speranza. Therefore, the Monteverdi scholar who supports the notion of role-doubling in this performance is indeed Tim Carter. Carter demonstrates a deep understanding and extensive knowledge of the intricacies of Monteverdi's composition and reveals new and insightful interpretations of performance configuration."},{"instruction":"Choose the sentence that goes against common sense.

He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D. But I can use this background: As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England. Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below . What is an answer for this question: Which electron would be closer to the nucleus, cat A or cat B? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided on Bohr's model, we can determine the position of electrons cat A and cat B relative to the nucleus. Recall that electrons with lower energy are found closer to the nucleus, while those with higher energy are found farther from the nucleus. In this case, cat A represents electrons with higher energy, and cat B represents electrons with lower energy. According to Bohr's model, electrons with lower energy are located at lower energy levels, which are closer to the nucleus. Since cat B electrons are associated with lower energy, they would be closer to the nucleus. In comparison, cat A electrons have higher energy and would be found at higher energy levels, farther away from the nucleus. Therefore, the answer to the question is that electron cat B would be closer to the nucleus when compared to electron cat A. Bohr's model was instrumental in understanding the behavior of electrons and their interactions with energy levels. The model's description of how electrons gain or lose energy, as illustrated with categories cat C and cat D, plays a crucial role in atomic processes such as absorption and emission of light. When an electron gains energy (cat C), it jumps to a higher energy level, and when it loses energy (cat D), it returns to a lower energy level. Though Bohr's model has its limitations and has since been replaced by the more sophisticated quantum mechanical model, it remains an essential foundation for helping us comprehend the dynamic nature of electrons in an atom."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

First, and most chillingly, is the fact that it's star, Robert Blake, was recently on trial for murdering his wife. Second, the recent Oscar winning biopic, \\"Capote\\" showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tale's author, Truman Capote. These two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience. As a stand alone film from it's era, \\"In Cold Blood\\" is top notch in every way. Most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from Conrad Hall (later of \\"American Beauty\\" and \\"Road to Perdition\\" fame). Many of the stills from this film of the Kansas farm house at night or the tree-lined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography. Combined with the cracker-jack direction from Brooks and superb editing in the early scenes (where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers), a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense (even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events). It's also great to see in this day and age how brilliantly staged a harrowing murder scene can be depicted where the graphic nature of the act is transmitted to the viewer subliminally with nary a drop of blood shown on screen. The film is also anchored nicely by Robert Blake's eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side of the killing duo. The flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done. Then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he is speaking to the reverend before being sent to the gallows and he makes his last \\"confession\\" so to speak. It's one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting, superb writing, flawless direction, and haunting photography. I dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rain's reflection from the window flowing down Robert Blake's pallid face in lieu of actual tears. The only thing hampering \\"In Cold Blood\\" is the slow moving middle act where the killers are on the lam and the forced nature of the social commentary at the end. The tacked-on political message about the death penalty is secondary to its compelling depiction of the mad killers and their prey. Would you say this review is positive or negative?

John initiates and controls the various experimental sexual practices of this volatile relationship to push Elizabeth's boundaries. In doing so, Elizabeth experiences a gradual downward spiral toward emotional breakdown. Elizabeth first sees John in New York City where she grocery shops and again at a street market where she decides against buying an expensive scarf. John wins her heart when he eventually produces that scarf. They start dating, and Elizabeth is increasingly subjected to John's behavioral peculiarities; he blindfolds Elizabeth, who is at first reluctant to comply with his sexual fantasy demands. Yet she sees him as loving and playful. He gives her an expensive gold watch, and instructs her to use it to think about him at noon. She takes this imperative even further by masturbating at her workplace at the designated time. However, he ultimately confuses Elizabeth by his reluctance to meet her friends despite the intimacy of their sexual relations. Elizabeth's confusion about John increases when he leaves her alone at his apartment. She examines his closet until she discovers a photograph of him with another woman.

Review: From the moment I walked into Delightful Bistro, I knew I was in for a special evening. The warm, welcoming atmosphere set the stage for a memorable dining experience that I'll be raving about for weeks to come. The combination of impeccable service, outstanding food, and a family-friendly ambiance truly blew me away. My evening at Delightful Bistro began with a friendly greeting from the hostess, who promptly showed my party to a private corner table that seemed custom-picked for us. The lighting was just right, dimmed perfectly to create an intimate setting while still allowing us to appreciate the beautiful and tasteful decor. The restaurant clearly pays close attention to all the little details that make a huge difference in crafting the perfect atmosphere. The extensive menu offered a wide range of delicious choices, catering to a variety of taste preferences and dietary restrictions. Our group opted for a selection of appetizers to start, including the seared scallops, baked brie, and truffled mushroom risotto. Each dish was thoughtfully presented, and the flavors were divine. The scallops were perfectly cooked, and the risotto was so creamy and rich that we were left craving more even after the dish was done. For entrees, I ordered the herb-crusted rack of lamb, while my friends chose the seared salmon, braised short ribs, and butternut squash ravioli. I can honestly say that every dish was beautifully prepared and cooked to perfection. The lamb was tender and juicy, with the herb crust providing a perfect contrast in texture. The salmon was expertly seared, with a crispy skin and moist, flavorful flesh that practically melted in my mouth. The ravioli? Absolutely heavenly, with a delicate balance of sweet and savory that left me wanting more. The talent in the kitchen was further evidenced by the accompanying sides and sauces. Each dish had a unique garnish or sauce that elevated the main ingredient's already incredible flavors. One notable standout was the velvety red wine reduction that accompanied the braised short ribs – it was a fantastic complement that made the dish even more tantalizing. Desert was truly a grand finale with a selection of handcrafted treats that were elegant, visually stunning, and decadent in taste. We shared the chocolate lava cake, lemon tart, and caramel flan, and each dessert was exquisite in its own right. The lava cake oozed rich, warm chocolate that paired perfectly with the cool vanilla ice cream, while the lemon tart stood out with its tangy, vibrant flavor and delicate crust. The service at Delightful Bistro truly deserves a round of applause. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and accommodating, ensuring that each course was served smoothly and anticipating our needs before we even realized them. The entire staff exuded a genuine warmth and desire to please that made us feel right at home. In summary, Delightful Bistro exceeded my expectations with its phenomenal food, top-notch service, and atmosphere that managed to be both elegant and family-friendly.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. Question: \\"What is the name of the person who made their fair share of provocative statements for the Western media?\\" Response: \\"Shirin Ebadi\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Available choices: (1). no (2). yes","output":"(1). no The response to the question is factually incorrect because the person who made their fair share of provocative statements for the Western media is Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, not Shirin Ebadi.

This step initiates the air flow into the respiratory system to enable the lungs to perform their function of extracting oxygen from the inhaled air and transferring it to the bloodstream. The entire process is as follows: 1. Inhalation: The process begins when the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles contract, causing the rib cage to expand and the diaphragm to move downwards. This expansion creates a decrease in pressure within the thoracic cavity, allowing air to flow into the lungs from the higher-pressure atmosphere. 2. The lungs expand: As the air flows in, the lungs expand to accommodate the increased volume. 3. Air is pulled from outside the body, into the lungs: During inhalation, air is drawn through the nose or mouth, down the trachea, and into the bronchial tubes, which branch into smaller and smaller airways called bronchioles. Eventually, the air reaches the alveoli, small air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place. 4. The membranes in the lungs collect oxygen molecules: The walls of the alveoli are made up of a thin membrane called the respiratory membrane, which is rich in blood vessels. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses through this membrane and into the surrounding capillaries. 5. Oxygen is transferred to red blood cells: Once in the capillaries, the oxygen molecules bind to hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells. This creates oxyhemoglobin, which has a high affinity for oxygen and allows for effective transport of the oxygen throughout the body. 6. Red blood cells distribute oxygen throughout the body: The oxygen-rich blood is then carried away from the lungs and distributed to the body's tissues and organs through the circulatory system. Oxygen is released from oxyhemoglobin to cells as needed, providing the essential fuel for cellular respiration and overall bodily function. During exhalation, the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles relax, allowing the rib cage and diaphragm to return to their resting positions. The decrease in thoracic cavity volume increases the pressure, pushing the air containing carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular respiration, out of the lungs and back into the atmosphere. This effectively completes the respiration process."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: You can buy fake teeth at many costume shops. Fake teeth are often designed to look as if some of your teeth are missing. You can visit a local costume or craft store and see if they sell fake teeth. Many people think of hillbillies as people with missing teeth. A trucker hat may be a good idea, for either a man or a woman. Trucker hats are sometimes associated with redneck/hillbilly culture. Rednecks are slightly different than hillbillies, however. Rednecks are thought of as working class southerners, while hillbillies tend to live in rural areas not necessarily in the south. A trucker hat may be seen as more redneck than hillbilly. You can try carrying a knapsack, which is a small bag usually made out of a blanket or rag. As hillbillies are often thought of as homeless or wandering, this could help you get the image down. Try carrying something like toilet paper in your knapsack. You can pull it out and carry this at parties or for pictures. Toilet paper may indicate you have to use the bathroom in the woods, giving you the rustic hillbilly feel. Bandanas are often associated with hillbilly outfits. Try tying a bandana around your neck or wrapping your hair in a bandana.

It could also be that the dog is merely curious about the cat and is observing it without any intention to engage in a chase.

The manse of the precentor, erroneously called the Bishop's House, is partially ruined and is dated 1557. (Fig. 2) Vestiges of the Dean's Manse and the Archdeacon's Manse (Fig. 3) are now part of private buildings.The hospital of Maison Dieu (the Alms House), dedicated to St Mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, was established by Bishop Andreas before 1237 for the aid of the poor. It suffered fire damage in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with other hospitals, have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of the Crown after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by James VI for educational purposes and for helping the poor. In 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.There were two friaries in the burgh. The Dominican Black Friars friary was founded in the western part of the burgh around 1233. The Franciscan (Friars Minor Conventual) Grey Friars friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh sometime before 1281. It is thought that this latter Grey Friars foundation did not long survive, but was followed between 1479 and 1513 by the foundation of a friary near Elgin Cathedral by the Franciscan (Observants) Grey Friars.

He was born near Busseto to a provincial family of moderate means, and developed a musical education with the help of a local patron. Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti, and Gioachino Rossini, whose works significantly influenced him. By his 30s, he had become one of the pre-eminent opera composers in history. Having achieved some fame and prosperity, Verdi began in 1859 to take an active interest in Italian politics. His early commitment to the Risorgimento movement is difficult to estimate accurately; in the words of the music historian Philip Gossett \\"myths intensifying and exaggerating [such] sentiment began circulating\\" during the nineteenth century. An example is the claim that when the \\"Va, pensiero\\" chorus in Nabucco was first sung in Milan, the audience, responding with nationalistic fervour, demanded an encore. As encores were expressly forbidden by the government at the time, such a gesture would have been extremely significant. But in fact the piece encored was not \\"Va, pensiero\\" but the hymn \\"Immenso Jehova\\". The growth of the \\"identification of Verdi's music with Italian nationalist politics\\" perhaps began in the 1840s. In 1848, the nationalist leader Giuseppe Mazzini, (whom Verdi had met in London the previous year) requested Verdi (who complied) to write a patriotic hymn. The opera historian Charles Osborne describes the 1849 La battaglia di Legnano as \\"an opera with a purpose\\" and maintains that \\"while parts of Verdi's earlier operas had frequently been taken up by the fighters of the Risorgimento...this time the composer had given the movement its own opera\\" It was not until 1859 in Naples, and only then spreading throughout Italy, that the slogan \\"Viva Verdi\\" was used as an acronym for Viva Vittorio Emanuele Re D'Italia (Viva Victor Emmanuel King of Italy), (who was then king of Piedmont). After Italy was unified in 1861, many of Verdi's early operas were increasingly re-interpreted as Risorgimento works with hidden Revolutionary messages that perhaps had not been originally intended by either the composer or his librettists. In 1859, Verdi was elected as a member of the new provincial council, and was appointed to head a group of five who would meet with King Vittorio Emanuele II in Turin. They were enthusiastically greeted along the way and in Turin Verdi himself received much of the publicity. On 17 October Verdi met with Cavour, the architect of the initial stages of Italian unification. Later that year the government of Emilia was subsumed under the United Provinces of Central Italy, and Verdi's political life temporarily came to an end. Whilst still maintaining nationalist feelings, he declined in 1860 the office of provincial council member to which he had been elected in absentia. Cavour however was anxious to convince a man of Verdi's stature that running for political office was essential to strengthening and securing Italy's future. The composer confided to Piave some years later that \\"I accepted on the condition that after a few months I would resign.\\" Verdi was elected on 3 February 1861 for the town of Borgo San Donnino (Fidenza) to the Parliament of Piedmont-Sardinia in Turin (which from March 1861 became the Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy), but following the death of Cavour in 1861, which deeply distressed him, he scarcely attended. Later, in 1874, Verdi was appointed a member of the Italian Senate, but did not participate in its activities. How long did he serve?","output":"Verdi served in the Parliament of Piedmont-Sardinia in Turin after being elected on 3 February 1861. However, after the death of Cavour in 1861, which deeply distressed him, he scarcely attended. It is not explicitly mentioned how long he served, but his appointment to the Italian Senate happened in 1874."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

One of these groups was called \\"military men.\\" Just like how many of you have toy soldiers, the real soldiers from the past needed a safe place to protect their villages and towns. These military men worked together as a team to create strong blockhouses, using big and tough logs, stones, and even bricks! They piled them high and made sure the walls were very thick and sturdy, so it was hard to break through. Another group that built blockhouses were the early settlers. These were people who moved from one place to another, looking for new and beautiful lands to live in, just like Dora the Explorer! To stay safe from wild animals and sometimes even other humans who weren't so friendly, these early settlers built their own blockhouses. They would construct these tall, cozy houses to live in, keep an eye out for danger, and sometimes hide if needed. So, blockhouses were built by both brave military men and adventurous settlers, who lived a very, very long time ago. Thanks to their hard work and creativity, these people were able to stay safe and look after their families and friends.

Your ferret can get tapeworms by swallowing infected fleas. If your ferret is scratching, comb through his fur with a fine-toothed flea comb, which is available at your local pet store.","output":"If you find fleas or flea dirt (tiny black specks that turn reddish-brown when wet) on your ferret, it's essential to follow a comprehensive plan to eliminate these parasites not only from your ferret but also from their environment. Start by providing your ferret with a suitable flea treatment specifically formulated for ferrets, as using dog or cat flea treatments can be harmful to your pet. Consult with your veterinarian on the best product options and dosages, as these may vary based on your ferret's age, weight, and overall health. While treating your ferret, also focus on thoroughly cleaning and treating their living area. Wash all bedding, hammocks, blankets, and fabric toys with hot water and mild detergent to kill fleas and their eggs. Vacuum all the surfaces, including carpets, rugs, and upholstery, to remove any lingering fleas or eggs. You can also use a pet-safe flea spray on those surfaces. Remember to empty the vacuum cleaner's bag or canister after each use, sealing its contents in a plastic bag before disposing of it. In addition to treating your ferret and cleaning their living environment, you should also focus on the yard or outdoor areas where they may play. Mow the grass to prevent fleas from hiding, and trim bushes and tree branches that can provide shelter to flea-infested wildlife. Applying outdoor flea treatments or sprays can further help reduce the risk of flea invasion. Once you have controlled the flea infestation, ensure that your ferret receives prompt treatment for tapeworms. Your veterinarian will prescribe a safe and effective tapeworm-specific medication, which may come in the form of a pill, a liquid, or even an injection. The type of treatment and the dosage will depend on the severity of the tapeworm infestation, your ferret's age, and their general health condition. Monitor your ferret closely after administering the tapeworm medication, making sure they don't show any adverse reactions to the treatment. In most cases, your ferret will pass the dead tapeworm segments in their feces within a few days. These segments may resemble rice grains or sesame seeds. It is crucial to maintain a clean living space and frequent litter box cleaning during this phase to avoid reinfection. To prevent future tapeworm infections in your ferret, adhere to a regular flea prevention regimen. Work with your veterinarian to choose the most suitable flea prevention product for your ferret and follow the recommended schedule. Ensure your ferret's living environment remains clean and free of fleas, including frequently washing their bedding and toys, vacuuming surfaces, and maintaining outdoor spaces. By following these guidelines and working closely with your veterinarian, you can successfully treat tapeworms in your ferret and prevent future infections, ensuring your beloved pet stays healthy and happy."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Are Letting Go and Te Amo songs?

Context: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. South Korean officials said there is possibility that Moon may join Trump in Singapore to help negotiate a nuclear deal with Kim, as the...

Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band . The next major installment of the series , Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock , was developed by Activision 's Neversoft division . - A game controller is a device used with games or entertainment systems to provide input to a video game, typically to control an object or character in the game. A controller is usually connected to a game console or computer by means of a wire or cord, although, since the mid-2000s, wireless controllers have become widespread. Input devices that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as steering wheels for driving games and light guns for shooting games, are also game controllers. - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. - Rhythm game or rhythm action is a genre of music-themed action video game that challenges a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads may be used as input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.

The dramatic events have been watched by Egypt's neighbours and the wider world. Here is the reaction of some governments around the world. United States President Barack Obama The people of Egypt have spoken, the voices have been heard and Egypt will never be the same. By stepping down, President Mubarak responded to the Egyptian people's hunger for change. But this is not the end of the Egypt's transition. It is a beginning. The military has served patriotically and responsibly as a caretaker to the state and will now have to ensure a transition that is credible in the eyes of the Egyptian people. That means protecting the rights of Egypt's citizens, lifting the emergency law, revising the constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible, and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free. The United States will continue to be a friend and partner to Egypt. We stand ready to provide whatever assistance is necessary and asked for to pursue a credible transition to democracy. Egyptians have inspired us. They have done so by putting the lie to the idea that justice best gained through violence. For in Egypt, it was the moral force of non-violence, not terrorism, not mindless killing, but non-violence, moral force, that bent the arc of history toward justice once more. European Union foreign policy chief Baroness Ashton The EU respects President Mubarak's decision today. By standing down, he has listened to the voices of the Egyptian people and has opened the way to faster and deeper reforms. It is important now that the dialogue is accelerated leading to a broad-based government which will respect the aspirations of, and deliver stability for, the Egyptian people. The future of Egypt rightly remains in the hands of the Egyptian people. The EU stands ready to help in any way it can. Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa This is a historic moment for Egypt, Egyptians, and even the Arab world - an unprecedented step, an unprecedented wide revolution and national consensus that has created an exceptional situation in Egypt. Now is the moment to build a national consensus to move towards the future, and I believe the future - our future, Egyptian future - should be built on both democracy and reform. And I think this will be the case. I'm very optimistic about that future after the events of the last couple of weeks, and in particular today. This is a popular revolution, a popular uprising, that has influenced events. It's not a coup. The President stepped down, and handed over power to the Higher Military Council, just to arrange things - I don't know the details of this - but no, it is not a coup. As an Egyptian citizen, I am proud to serve my country with all the others at this stage, to build a consensus of opinion. British Prime Minister David Cameron Egypt now has a really precious moment of opportunity to have a government that can bring the country together. As a friend of Egypt, and the Egyptian people, we stand ready to help in any way we can. We believe it must be a government that starts to put in place the building blocks of a truly open, free and democratic society. French President Nicolas Sarkozy France ardently hopes the new Egyptian authorities will take steps that lead to establishment of democratic institutions through free and transparent elections. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Despite all the (West's) complicated and satanic designs... a new Middle East is emerging without the Zionist regime and US interference, a place where the arrogant powers will have no place. It's your right to be free. It's your right to exercise your will and sovereignty... and choose the type of government and the rulers. Israel - unnamed senior official It's too early to foresee how [the resignation] will affect things. We hope that the change to democracy in Egypt will happen without violence and that the peace accord will remain. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri The resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is the beginning of the victory of the Egyptian revolution. Such a victory was the result of the sacrifices and the steadfastness of the Egyptian people. We call upon the new Egyptian leadership to take an immediate decision to lift the blockade of Gaza and open Rafah [border] crossing permanently to allow people's free movement and in order for the reconstruction process of Gaza to begin. Chinese state-run China Daily Social stability should be of overriding importance. It is hoped that the Egyptian military, government and its people will make every effort to maintain social stability and restore normal order. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov We hope the latest developments will help restore stability and normal functioning of all power structures. We hope that not only the government but also the opposition will show willingness to stabilise the situation. German Chancellor Angela Merkel Today is a day of great joy. We are all witness to an historic change. I share the joy of the people of Egypt, with the millions of people on the streets of Egypt. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu Congratulations to the Egyptian people. And we hope that a system meeting the expectations of the Egyptian people will emerge. Emir of Qatar This is a positive, important step towards the Egyptian people's aspirations of achieving democracy and reform and a life of dignity. United Arab Emirates The UAE, which has closely monitored developments in Egypt, confirms its confidence in the ability of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in running the country's affairs in these delicate circumstances in such a way that would realise aspirations and hopes of the Egyptian people. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki The resignation of President Hosni Mubarak is a step in the right direction because it came as a response to Egyptians' desire and will for change, and we have confirmed trust that our sister Egypt and its great people, with their experience, history and efficiency, will select leadership that will fulfil their ambitions and keep Egypt's security, stability and great position in the world. Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen I welcome President Mubarak's decision. I have consistently called for a speedy, orderly and peaceful transition to democracy, respecting the legitimate aspirations of the people of Egypt. In the long run, no society can neglect the will of the people. Democracy means much more than majority rule - it also means respect for individual freedom, for minorities, human rights and the rule of law. Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini We take note of the evolution that has happened in Egypt. This is an important development for the Egyptian people and its legitimate democratic aspirations. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard Together with many other concerned nations, Australia calls for fundamental reform that will ensure the opportunity and freedoms that ordinary Egyptians have been calling for. Australia calls for constitutional reform and a clear timetable towards free and fair elections and a representative civilian government that will govern for all Egyptians. Indian Foreign Minister S M Krishna We welcome the decision of President Mubarak to step down in deference to the wishes of the people of Egypt. We also welcome the commitment of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to ensure a peaceful transition of power in a timebound manner to establish and open and democratic framework of governance. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Vice-President Omar Suleiman made the announcement on state television Hosni Mubarak has stepped down as president of Egypt, after weeks of protest in Cairo and other cities.

The military high command is headed by Defence Minister Mohamed Hussein Tantawi. US diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks described Field Marshal Tantawi as \\"aged and change-resistant\\", but committed to avoiding another war with Israel. Mr Mubarak has already left Cairo and is in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh where he has a residence, officials say. In Cairo, thousands of people gathered outside the presidential palace, in Tahrir Square and at state TV. They came out in anger following an address by Mr Mubarak on Thursday.

At the scene It is hard to know where to look as you walk through central Cairo. Everyone in this mega-city has spilled out onto the streets to party. Soldiers lift small, smiling children onto their tanks to pose for photos, whole families are flying flags and wearing matching hats in red, white and black as they walk along the Corniche by the Nile, and motorcyclists precariously weave their way through the crowds yelling \\"Egypt, Egypt\\". The excited din from Tahrir Square, the scene of the massive protests against President Mubarak that began on 25 January, can be heard from miles off. It is packed with huge crowds. The demonstrators' barricades that had controlled entry to the square have been dismantled, and security checkpoints at which people showed identification and had their bags searched have all gone. Some people are already packing up their tents in the campsite nearby. They have achieved what they set out to do. Day of glory for Tahrir Square protesters Ayman Nour, Mr Mubarak's rival for the presidency in 2005, described it as the greatest day in Egypt's history. \\"This nation has been born again. These people have been born again, and this is a new Egypt,\\" he told al-Jazeera TV. Meanwhile Amr Moussa, a former Egyptian foreign minister, announced that he would leave his post as secretary general of the Arab League \\"within weeks\\", the Egyptian news agency Mena reported. He hinted that he might stand for president. The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo said the announcement caught everyone by surprise: all over the city, drivers honked their horns and people fired guns into the air. But the army takeover looks very much like a military coup, our correspondent adds. The constitution has been breached, he says, because officially it should be the speaker of parliament who takes over, not the army leadership.

Assuming that: When we add resistors in parallel to each other the total resistance decreases and the current increases. The answer to this question is:","output":"When we change resistors in series to be in parallel, the total resistance decreases. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. When resistors are in series, the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances: R_total = R1 + R2 + ... + Rn. 2. When resistors are in parallel, the total resistance can be calculated using the inverse of the sum of the inverse of the individual resistances: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... + 1/Rn. 3. If we take the same resistors and change their arrangement from series to parallel, the combined effect of the resistances will be less for the parallel configuration. 4. Since the equivalent resistance of parallel resistors is less than that of the series resistors, this means that the total resistance of the circuit decreases when we change resistors in series to be in parallel. 5. The current increases as a result of the decrease in total resistance, which aligns with the assumption given that adding resistors in parallel decreases resistance and increases the current."},{"instruction":"I heard that Riley's assignment was due tomorrow so she had to rush fast.

The Garden Grove woman answered a series of questions to create and print a form to file with the court. \\"It's easy,\\" said Adams, 25. \\"I thought I'd have all kinds of questions and have to take the forms home.\\" A University of California, Irvine, study released Wednesday found an interactive computer system effectively helps people fill out paperwork for restraining orders, eviction defense, small-claims cases and requests for filing-fee waivers. Not only does the system make life easier for people who can't afford a lawyer, but it also might improve efficiency in the courts because the forms, which are printed out when completed, are easy to read and are being filled out correctly, the study found. Since the program started in 2000, more than 6,000 people have used the free system, located in public buildings throughout Orange County. The system was developed by the Legal Aid Society of Orange County with about 800,000 in grants. The program avoids legal jargon, offers a courthouse video tour and sticks to a fifth-grade vocabulary. Users can choose English, Spanish or Vietnamese. Kiosks are in courthouses in Fullerton and Orange, the district attorney's family-support office, the Legal Aid Society in Santa Ana, Irvine City Hall and the San Juan Capistrano Library. The program is also available online. Bob Cohen, executive director of Legal Aid, said the study should clear the way for expansion throughout California. Locally, a program for divorce petitions will be added this summer. Cohen said the system proves the benefit of technology tailored to those who aren't computer-savvy. He said much of the technology now available requires Internet skills and access.

He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts. Breitbart foresees what will be known as the Holocaust and returns to Poland to warn the Jewish people...

In January, plans were approved to downgrade maternity care at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire. But managers backed down after an outcry which prompted the rethink at a health board meeting on Tuesday. The issues stemmed from a shortage of doctors. Health board medical director Prof Matthew Makin told the meeting: \\"There is a universal desire for the safety of mothers and babies - that's why we're all here. \\"Service change is seen as a threat and is particularly emotive. But we would not be proposing change unless we felt that the risks we are currently managing are becoming unmanageable. \\"Any change will be temporary and for as short a time as possible to stabilise the service.\\" The health board's interim chief executive Simon Dean told BBC Radio Wales it had made 14 attempts to recruit doctors in the last nine month, saying the difficult past few years for the health board \\"may well be a factor\\". Mary Heard, 36, from Rhyl, Denbighshire, and her 10-week-old daughter, Aurelia, were in the meeting listening to the discussion. Speaking afterwards, she said she disagreed with the health board's preferred option to withdraw consultant-led care at Glan Clwyd Hospital. \\"All my three children were high-risk births. It meant a lot to me to have them at Glan Clwyd,\\" she said. \\"My husband works and many of my family don't drive, so if I'd given birth elsewhere, I wouldn't have had anyone with me.\\" Bosses still favour the option to downgrade services at Glan Clwyd Hospital - a plan which was challenged in court - and the board agreed at its meeting in Llandudno, Conwy county, to press ahead with a public consultation on that and other plans. This could mean withdrawing doctor-led maternity care at Bangor or Wrexham or there could be no change so consultant-led care would remain at all three hospitals. On Sunday, Mr Dean said maternity units in north Wales have previously been forced to temporarily shut over safety fears for mothers and babies. Critics of the plan say expectant mothers needing care from doctors would be put at greater risk by having to travel further. The British Medical Association and politicians have also been highly critical of the health board for not seeking the views of staff and the public in drawing up its plans. A final decision will be taken in November after the consultation closes. Summary:","output":"Alright kiddo, so there's this really important group of people who run a hospital in a place called Wales. They are thinking of changing some things because they don't have enough doctors. One of those changes might be in the part of the hospital where babies are born. This has made a lot of people upset, especially a lady named Mary who had her babies there. These people are worried that if this change happens, moms will have to travel really far to have their babies, which could be dangerous. Now, these hospital folks are going to ask everyone what they think about this change, and they'll make a final decision in November."},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem?

The Shell Method: Step 1: Crack the egg gently on the edge of a bowl or countertop. Step 2: Hold the egg over a bowl (for whites) and use the two halves of the eggshell to separate the yolk by letting the egg white flow into the bowl while keeping the yolk inside the shell. Transfer the yolk back and forth between the shells until all the whites have dripped into the bowl. Pros of the shell method: - It requires no additional tools or equipment. - It is quick and easy to learn. Cons of the shell method: - There's a risk of breaking the yolk and contaminating the whites with yolk. - Small eggshell particles may end up in the egg whites. 2. The Hand Method: Step 1: Crack the egg gently on the edge of a bowl or countertop. Step 2: Hold the egg over a bowl (for whites) and let the egg white flow into the bowl while keeping the yolk in your hand. You can pass the yolk between both hands to remove any remaining egg whites. Pros of the hand method: - It is less likely to break the yolk since you can better control the pressure applied to it. - It is less likely to have eggshell particles in the egg whites. - It is beginner-friendly and easy to learn. - No additional tools are needed. Cons of the hand method: - It is messier due to hand contact with both the yolk and whites. - It may not be as hygienic from a food safety perspective if hands are not properly washed and cleaned. Conclusion: Both the shell method and the hand method have their pros and cons. The best solution will depend on the individual's comfort, level of experience, and concern for food safety. If the person is experienced in separating eggs and is more concerned about potential contamination, the hand method is recommended. However, if the person is new to separating eggs and prefers a less messy approach, the shell method may be more suitable. Ultimately, both methods can effectively achieve the goal of splitting the egg whites from the egg yolks."},{"instruction":"Here is your conversation with my revisions marked (deletions struck through, insertions in bold).

A: It is a contract for the sale of a certain kind of commodity through a regulated exchange. SP: How is the contract different than a non-futures contract? A: Ahem, just for your information, we call the non-futures contracts forward or over the counter contracts. The big difference is that the forward contract does not must go to delivery while futures contracts do not. SP: I though the futures contracts went to delivery. I remember getting all messed up on the gas side with delivery of NYMEX futures gas at the Henry Hub, and what about those stories of a guys getting a load of soy beans dumped in their front yards? A: Well, er, yes they do sometimes go to delivery, but they are not really supposed to relatively few of them go to delivery. They are supposed to more frequently (actually the vast majority of the time) net out as financial transactions. It's that option of settling financially that distinguishes the futures contract. SP: Well lets get to the point, why are physical buy sells so bad? A: That's easy. Because they look like futures contracts. They are not intended to go to delivery. And if you are trading in futures contracts you are supposed to be doing it on a CFTC regulated exchange. SP: So what you are saying is that if we deliberately net out our physical deals and never intend to even try to schedule delivery under them we are trading in futures contracts and could be subject to regulation by the CFTC? A: You've got it. But it's even worse than that - federal law says that a futures contract which is not traded on a regulated exchange is illegal: not only could the CFTC come after you but your counterparties could use that law against you to get out of performing. So you can think of each contract like that as having written a free option. SP: Well how much physicality do we have to have to make it a forward contract? A: What do you mean? SP: Well, if we settled physically one day a month but financially the other 29 days, would we have a futures contract? A: Oh for Christ's sake I've had it.

Oklahoma! is a groundbreaking American musical, with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. The stage show is an adaptation of the 1931 play \\"Green Grow the Lilacs\\" by Lynn Riggs. This modern musical premiered on Broadway on March 31, 1943, and it is considered one of the earliest examples of the now-familiar book musical format, where the songs and dances are woven seamlessly into a well-crafted, cohesive narrative. Oklahoma! is a classic story set in the Oklahoma territory in the early 20th century. It follows the romantic pursuits of the spirited and independent Laurey Williams and the charming cowboy Curly McLain. Throughout their journey, the couple must navigate the ups and downs of love, as well as the challenges posed by Jud Fry, a brooding and dangerous farmhand who covets Laurey. The musical captures the essence of rural America at that time and paints a vivid portrait of life in the newly settled land. \\"People Will Say We're in Love\\" is a beautiful duet between Laurey and Curly. In this song, the two characters coyly express their feelings for each other while attempting to maintain a playful sense of denial. They sing about wanting to avoid public speculation about their budding romance, but in reality, they are subtly revealing their true emotions to one another. It is a tender and heartwarming moment in the show that highlights the budding relationship between the lead characters. \\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\\" is another captivating song from Oklahoma! Curly sings it to Laurey in an attempt to convince her to go to a social event with him. He engages in a charming and imaginative description of a lavish surrey, or horse-drawn carriage, that he claims to have. The song showcases Curly's charisma and creativity, as well as his ultimately endearing effort to win Laurey's affection. Despite the fact that the surrey exists only in his imagination, Laurey is won over by Curly's poetic descriptions and flirtatiousness. The stage show Oklahoma! was a landmark production in the history of musical theater. It introduced innovative storytelling techniques, incorporating songs and dances as integral components of the narrative, and tackled complex themes and emotions. The songs \\"People Will Say We're in Love\\" and \\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\\" are just two examples of the delightful and memorable music found in this iconic production. The show's impact on the world of theater has been profound, and its popularity endures to this day, continuing to delight audiences in productions all over the world."},{"instruction":"Arsenal legend George Graham has said that Danny Welbeck will work his socks off for Arsene Wenger's side, but must improve his finishing if he is to be a success at the Emirates.

My girlfriend had a burrito, which neither of us enjoyed as much because the flour tortilla tasted a little flat and she didn't enjoy the spice of the chicken. The chips where great, with a flour/corn mix flavor. I thought the salsa was good but bland. It tasted fresh, but lacked bite. I spiced it up and it was much better. The rice was some of the best I have had, and the beans were very good. I have had refried beans on a couple of different occasions in Phoenix and often there is a real smokey flavor.

This is an unusual form of transportation, because it is a tunnel that trains travel through and not an actual form of transportation. The Chunnel is actually the English nickname for the Channel Tunnel. In French,it is called le tunnel sous la Manche. It is a rail tunnel beneath the English Channel at the Straits of Dover. It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race while they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about 21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel. The two outside ones are the passenger trains. The small inner one is a guidance train. The guidance train is not used for transportation. Each track is exactly parallel to each other. There are four different train systems in the Chunnel. The Eurostar is a high speed passenger service that connects London, Paris, Brussels and Lille. The Eurotunnel shuttle is a rail ferry service. These shuttles carry cars and vans. These are railcars that allow drivers to drive their vehicles on and off. There are also two Eurotunnel goods service trains. Now you know more about the Chunnel.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? i just woke up listening to phil collins Pick your answer from: a). negative b). positive","output":"b). positive The sentiment of the tweet \\"i just woke up listening to phil collins\\" can be described as positive for several reasons. 1. First and foremost, the person has expressed the fact that they have woken up, which could suggest that they had a good night's sleep and are feeling refreshed. Waking up is often associated with new beginnings and a fresh start, which tend to have positive connotations. 2. Secondly, the act of listening to Phil Collins suggests that the person is enjoying music as they wake up. Music has the power to uplift one's mood and create a positive atmosphere, and it seems that the tweet's author is reveling in the tunes of one of their favorite artists. Phil Collins is known for his emotional and inspiring music, which can contribute to the feeling of positivity. 3. The fact that they chose to share this moment on social media also implies that they want to spread their positivity to others. When people share their experiences and emotions on social media, they often do so in an attempt to connect with others or convey their feelings. This tweet seems to have a hopeful and enthusiastic tone, which we can assume the person was trying to express and share with others who may also appreciate Phil Collins' music. 4. Moreover, the overall tone of the tweet is not negative or sarcastic, which indicates that the author is genuinely enjoying their morning. If the sentiment of the tweet was negative, the author might have complained about something or used negative language to describe their feelings. However, the simplicity and straightforwardness of this tweet suggest a sense of positivity. 5. Finally, it is important to consider the preconceived notions people have about the artist Phil Collins. As an accomplished composer, singer, and actor, Collins has earned the admiration of millions.

They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang. As time passes, Vallian manages to kill the bandits one by one. The remaining four keep up their pursuit. Vallian is obviously attracted to Susanna, and she to him. Following a moment of high drama, she succumbs to his advances and they share a passionate kiss.

In fact, phospholipids are similar in structure to triglycerides. However, instead of having three fatty acids, a phospholipid is generated from a diglyceride, a glycerol with just two fatty acid chains (Figure 2.23). The third binding site on the glycerol is taken up by the phosphate group, which in turn is attached to a polar “head” region of the molecule. Recall that triglycerides are nonpolar and hydrophobic. This still holds for the fatty acid portion of a phospholipid compound. However, the head of a phospholipid contains charges on the phosphate groups, as well as on the nitrogen atom. These charges make the phospholipid head hydrophilic. Therefore, phospholipids are said to have hydrophobic tails, containing the neutral fatty acids, and hydrophilic heads, containing the charged phosphate groups and nitrogen atom.

In this statement, the importance of showing unity and support for the people of Iraq and Palestine in the fight against the harmful impacts of neo-liberal globalization is being highlighted. Neo-liberal globalization is the economic and political project that promotes the liberalization of trade, deregulation, privatization, and the reduction of government's role in the economy. It has greatly influenced global politics and economics over the past few decades. First, let's focus on the significance of solidarity with Iraq and Palestine. Both countries have faced considerable challenges in the recent past, and these challenges have been exacerbated by the effects of neo-liberal globalization. In Iraq, the country has struggled with political instability, violence, and conflict following the US-led invasion in 2003. The dismantling of the Iraqi state institutions and the implementation of \\"shock therapy\\" economic policies have led to widespread poverty and unemployment in the country, fueling conflict and instability. Similarly, in Palestine, the ongoing Israeli occupation has severely impacted the social, economic, and political conditions faced by the Palestinian people. The Israeli occupation has not only denied Palestinians their basic rights but also undermined their economic development and access to resources. Neo-liberal globalization has reinforced these conditions, as Israeli settlements continue to expand and global powers offer little support for the Palestinian struggle for self-determination and national sovereignty. The internationalist struggle in this context is an ideological and political movement that seeks to promote international cooperation and solidarity among people and nations across the globe. This struggle opposes the detrimental effects of neo-liberal globalization by advocating for economic and political alternatives that prioritize the welfare of people over profits, promote social justice and democracy, and challenge the hegemony of global powers. Solidarity with Iraq and Palestine, in this regard, is an essential part of the internationalist effort to challenge the negative consequences of neo-liberal globalization. By standing with these people in their pursuit of justice, self-determination, and resistance against imperialism and occupation, internationalists aim to strengthen the global movement against neo-liberalism and its associated policies. This solidarity is demonstrated through various means, including political, financial, and diplomatic support, grassroots activism, and the promotion of alternative narratives that highlight the struggles and resilience of the people of Iraq and Palestine. In conclusion, showing solidarity with Iraq and Palestine is a crucial component of the internationalist struggle against neo-liberal globalization. By standing in alliance with those who are marginalized, oppressed, and exploited by powerful global forces, we collectively work toward a more just and equitable world order that respects the rights and aspirations of all people across the globe."},{"instruction":"Premise: so and i i've got a son Hypothesis: I have a son.

This will show the student the process for working though the problem without any complicating factors. For example, 63/3=21. The 3 will go into the 6 evenly, then the 3 will go into the 3 evenly. There are no remainders on either step. Most students will begin learning long division in 3rd grade, or around the age of 8 or 9. The divisor is the number that you are dividing by, while the dividend is the number you’re dividing into. Tell your student that they will need to divide each unit in the dividend by the divisor, starting with the largest unit. For example, you’d divide the 100s unit, then the 10s unit, and finally the 1s unit. Let’s say your problem is 54/3. Your divisor is 3, which goes into 5 just 1 time. However, you are left with a remainder of 2, which your student will need to save for the next step. Similarly, let’s say your problem is 155/4. You can’t divide 4 into 1, so you’d divide it into 15. This would give you 3, with a remainder of 3. Explain that they will need to multiply the number of times that the divisor goes into the first number by the divisor. They will subtract this product from the units in the dividend to find the remainder, which they’ll carry over to the next unit. As you work though 54/3, you know that 3 goes into 5 just 1 time with a remainder of 2. You’d multiply 3 x 1 = 3. Subtract 3 from 5 to get 2. Leave the 2 in the 10s spot. Similarly, for 155/4, you know that 4 goes into 15 just 3 times. You’d multiply 4 x 3 = 12. Subtract 15-12= 3. Carry the 3 down in the 10s spot. Carry the next unit down, adding it to the remainder. Then, divide the divisor into this number. Write the result into your answer, and then subtract to find your remainder, if you have 1. Working through 54/3, you will carry the 4 down, writing it next to the 2, which gives you 24. You’ll next divide 3 into 24. This gives you 8. Putting it all together, your answer is 54/3=18. Similarly, as you work through 155/4, you’d now have a 3 left in your 10s spot. Carry down the 5, to give you 35. Divide the 4 into 35, which will give you a result of 8, with 3 remaining. Explain that the number of steps you’ll take depends on how many numbers are in the dividend. For example, 155/3 will have fewer steps than 1555/3. However, the process for each unit remains the same. Once the student has divided the divisor into the 1s place, they’ve reached the end of the problem. If the divisor does not go in evenly, there will be a remainder. They’ll need to include this remainder in their answer. Since 3 goes into 54 evenly, you don’t have a remainder. However, 55/3 would give you a remainder of 1. You would find this remainder like this: If you divide 3 into 5, you get 1, with 2 remaining. You’d then divide 3 into 25, which would give you 8, with 1 remaining. This is your remainder. Your remainder should be written as part of your answer. You can indicate that it’s a remainder by writing “R” in front of it. Alternatively, you may write out the word “Remainder\\" followed by the number. For example, you’d write 55/3=18 R 1 or 55/3=18 Remainder 1. Lots of practice is essential for mastering math concepts. You can create your own worksheets or download them for free online. You could provide your student with real world scenarios to help them practice long division. For example, they could practice dividing large quantities of food among party guests. Similarly, you could have them divide their birthday money into 3 categories: spend now, save for later, save for college. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article explains the concept of long division, a mathematical process introduced to students around 3rd grade or at the age of 8 or 9.

Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] and the situation: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot. Answer the following question: Which lake had fewer dissolved nutrients? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided and the specific situations given for the two lakes, it can be inferred that High lake had fewer dissolved nutrients. Water stratification, which was observed in High lake, is the characteristic of water bodies where layers with different properties such as temperature, density, salinity, or oxygen content form and prevent the mixing of water, thereby acting as barriers. The barrier created by stratification prevents the upward movement of nutrients from the deeper, more dense layers to the less dense, upper layers. In the case of High lake, the fresh and salt water mixing led to the formation of stratification. This would have resulted in layers that blocked the upward transfer of nutrient-rich water from the deeper parts of the lake. Therefore, the upper layers of the water, where light is available and primary production (photosynthesis by phytoplankton) occurs, lacked necessary nutrients. Primary production drives net productivity in waters because it forms the base of the aquatic food web. Therefore, the blockage in nutrient transfer due to stratification can limit the amount and type of life a water body can support. On the other hand, the scenario mentioned for Low lake suggests that it did not have issues related to water stratification. This would mean that a healthier exchange of nutrients was possible throughout the depth of the lake, leading to better overall nutrient availability and promoting productivity. As a result, Low lake was described as a 'prolific fishing spot,' indicating that it supported more aquatic life due presumably to the abundance of nutrients that led to more primary production and, in turn, higher trophic levels like fish. Therefore, in comparison, High lake would have had fewer dissolved nutrients due to the water stratification hindering the distribution of nutrients, leading primarily to a reduction in primary production and overall net productivity."},{"instruction":"What kind of life do you want?

The phrase \\"bad film\\" inherently attaches a negative connotation to the movie being discussed. It implies that the reviewer did not enjoy it or felt that it had significant shortcomings. Additionally, when the reviewer says \\"you thought was going to be really awful,\\" it shows that their expectations going into the movie were very low. This might mean that they had heard negative things about it prior or the promotional materials (like trailers and marketing campaigns) failed to impress them. Even though the actual film might not have been \\"really awful\\" according to their preconceived judgment, the fact they felt compelled to clarify this hints that the film still wasn't good, just not as bad as they expected. Furthermore, there's no mention of any redeeming qualities or aspects they enjoyed that would help balance this review into a more neutral or positive light. With no such elements or context, we can clearly identify this review as having a negative opinion about the movie. In conclusion, based on this review, it would be safe to advise potential viewers who align with this reviewer's taste in movies to perhaps skip this one, or watch it with the understanding that it was perceived poorly by some. A review like this can potentially affect a movie's reputation and viewership, unless contrasted by other reviews that offer a more positive perspective."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Background: During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.[1] Paragraph: Two countries situated at different latitudes are exposed to climate change. Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, while Ecuador is located near the Equator. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country will feel the effects of climate change more drastically? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, the country that will feel the effects of climate change more drastically is Iceland. This is because Iceland is located at a higher latitude closer to the North Pole, and it has been noted that the effects of climate change tend to be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world. As a result, Iceland is expected to experience more significant and rapid changes in its environment due to climate change compared to Ecuador, which is located near the Equator."},{"instruction":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the is the full name of the character who becomes upset with Mike Waring upon learning that he has informed on Andrews?

Passage:The first complete Tosca recording was made in 1918, using the acoustic process. The conductor, Carlo Sabajno, had been the Gramophone Company's house conductor since 1904; he had made early complete recordings of several operas, including Verdi's La traviata and Rigoletto, before tackling Tosca with a largely unknown cast, featuring the Italian soprano Lya Remondini in the title role. The next year, in 1919, Sabajno recorded Tosca again, this time with more well-known singers, including Valentina Bartolomasi and Attilio Salvaneschi as Tosca and Cavaradossi. Ten years later, in 1929, Sabajno returned to the opera for the third time, recording it, by the electrical process, with the orchestra and chorus of the Teatro alla Scala and with stars Carmen Melis and Apollo Granforte in the roles of Tosca and Scarpia. In 1938 HMV secured the services of the renowned tenor Beniamino Gigli, together with the soprano Maria Caniglia as Tosca and conductor Oliviero De Fabritiis, for a \\"practically complete\\" recording that extended over 14 double-sided shellac discs.","output":"b"},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

After training in singing, strings playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga's court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio—a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas—into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: Dafne, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo by Emilio de' Cavalieri, Peri's Euridice and Giulio Caccini's identically titled Euridice—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo.The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo's time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano's lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court's musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini's play Il pastor fido, described... Guess a valid title for it!

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Colon The cecum blends seamlessly with the colon. Upon entering the colon, the food residue first travels up the ascending colon on the right side of the abdomen. At the inferior surface of the liver, the colon bends to form the right colic flexure (hepatic flexure) and becomes the transverse colon. The region defined as hindgut begins with the last third of the transverse colon and continues on. Food residue passing through the transverse colon travels across to the left side of the abdomen, where the colon angles sharply immediately inferior to the spleen, at the left colic flexure (splenic flexure). From there, food residue passes through the descending colon, which runs down the left side of the posterior abdominal wall. After entering the pelvis inferiorly, it becomes the s-shaped sigmoid colon, which extends medially to the midline (Figure 23.21). The ascending and descending colon, and the rectum (discussed next) are located in the retroperitoneum. The transverse and sigmoid colon are tethered to the posterior abdominal wall by the mesocolon.

It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - Arithmetic or arithmetics (from the Greek \\"arithmos\\", \\"number\\") is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics. It consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations between themaddition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms \\"arithmetic\\" and \\"higher arithmetic\\" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for \\"number theory\\" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory. - A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines. - The Corporate Machine is a strategy computer game from Stardock in which the goal is to create a corporation in one of four industries ( automobiles , aircraft , computers , or soft drinks ) and eventually dominate rival companies . To win the player must dominate the chosen market ( getting 55 % to 65 % of the market share depending on the number of opponents . ) The Corporate Machine is a follow up to the game Business Tycoon , which was itself a sequel to the game Entrepreneur , all developed by Stardock . - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies. - Stardock Corporation is a software development company founded in 1991 and incorporated in 1993 as Stardock Systems. Stardock initially developed for the OS/2 platform, but was forced to switch to Microsoft Windows due to the collapse of the OS/2 software market between 1997 and 1998. The company is best known for computer programs that allow a user to modify or extend a graphical user interface as well as personal computer games, particularly strategy games such as the \\"Galactic Civilizations\\" series, \\"\\", \\"\\", and Ashes of the Singularity. - Galactic Civilizations is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Stardock and released in March 2003. The game is a remake of a vintage OS/2 series of the same name. An expansion pack entitled \\"Altarian Prophecy\\" was released in July 2004. A sequel, \\"\\", was released February 21, 2006. On May 14, 2015 Stardock released \\"Galactic Civilizations III\\". - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile. - A Company is a legal entity made up of an association of persons, be they natural, legal, or a mixture of both, for carrying on a commercial or industrial enterprise. Company members share a common purpose and unite in order to focus their various talents and organize their collectively available skills or resources to achieve specific, declared goals. Companies take various forms such as: - A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques. - In consumer electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, used to operate the device wirelessly from a short distance. Remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the consumer, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. - A smartphone is a mobile phone (also known as cell phones or cell mobiles) with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the Priv/Passport BlackBerrys, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features. - A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an \\"ad hoc\\" act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. - A mobile device (or handheld computer) is a small computing device, typically, small enough to hold and operate in the hand and having an operating system capable of running mobile apps. These may provide a diverse range of functions. Typically, the device will have a display screen with a small numeric or alphanumeric keyboard or a touchscreen providing a virtual keyboard and buttons (icons) on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or near field communication (NFC). Integrated cameras, digital media players, mobile phone and GPS capabilities are common. Power is typically provided by a lithium battery.

And being stupid means they can not grasp the notion that different opinions do n't necessarily mean the person you disagree with is evil . Question: What might happen next ?","output":"To approach this question, I will analyze the potential outcomes based on the context provided, which is about a group of people who are \\"stupid\\" and have difficulty understanding that different opinions aren't necessarily evil. Step 1: Identify potential outcomes - Misunderstanding and conflict - Attempts to change the other person's opinion - Creation of an echo chamber - Development of negative biases towards people with different opinions - Compartmentalizing of relationships Step 2: Evaluate each potential outcome and provide reasoning Outcome 1: Misunderstanding and conflict - The group may engage in arguments, or even escalate to hostility, as they might believe that their opinions are the only correct ones and view others as threats or enemies. This outcome is highly likely if the group lacks empathy and critical thinking skills. Outcome 2: Attempts to change the other person's opinion - They could try to persuade others to adopt their beliefs, using various tactics such as peer pressure or manipulation. This outcome is probable if the group is motivated and passionate about their opinions but lacks the ability to engage in open and respectful conversations. Outcome 3: Creation of an echo chamber - The group may opt to only interact with like-minded individuals or avoid exposing themselves to different opinions altogether. This outcome is possible if the group is uncomfortable with cognitive dissonance and prefers to remain in an environment where their beliefs are constantly reinforced. Outcome 4: Development of negative biases towards people with different opinions - The group may generalize and label people with differing opinions as \\"evil\\" or \\"inferior,\\" promoting prejudiced mindsets. This outcome is plausible if the group heavily bases their self-identity on their opinions and views others as threats to their self-worth. Outcome 5: Compartmentalizing of relationships - They could still maintain connections with people who have different opinions but choose to avoid discussing sensitive or controversial topics with them. This outcome is achievable if the group values their relationships enough to set boundaries and compromise despite the difference in opinions. In conclusion, there are several possible outcomes that can occur when a group of people is unable to grasp the notion that different opinions don't necessarily mean the person they disagree with is evil. These outcomes range from conflicts and negative biases to compartmentalizing relationships and creating echo chambers. The likelihood of each outcome will depend on the specific characteristics and priorities of the group in question."},{"instruction":"Read this article and answer this question Li Zicheng and Tibetans were fought against by the Monguors, who supported the Ming, and when the Qing fought against Li's forces after 1644 they joined the Qing side. Late in 1646, forces assembled by a Muslim leader known in Chinese sources as Milayin revolted against Qing rule in Ganzhou . He was soon joined by another Muslim named Ding Guodong . Proclaiming that they wanted to restore the fallen Ming, they occupied a number of towns in Gansu, including the provincial capital Lanzhou. These rebels' willingness to collaborate with non-Muslim Chinese suggests that they were not only driven by religion, and were not aiming to create an Islamic state. To pacify the rebels, the Qing government quickly despatched Meng Qiaofang , governor of Shaanxi, a former Ming official who had surrendered to the Qing in 1631. Both Milayin and Ding Guodong were captured and killed in 1648, and by 1650 the Muslim rebels had been crushed in campaigns that inflicted heavy casualties. The Muslim Ming loyalists were supported by the Muslim Chagatid Kumul Khanate and the Turfan Khanate and after their defeat, Kumul submitted to the Qing.

Article: For a stay-at-home mom, a computer with an Internet connection can truly be a lifeline . When diapers and baby talk become just too much, adult talk is just a click away. But for some moms, the attraction of the online world becomes too strong to resist and instead of being an occasional thing, it becomes an addiction . Coleen Moore of the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery says she is seeing a growing number of young stay-at -home moms for whom blogs and social networking have become a passion, which will harm their real-world lives. Now, Internet addiction is not officially recognized as a mental disorder. But a recent survey showed 14 percent of Internet users find it hard to stay away from their computers for several days at a time, and that 8 percent use the Web to escape problems. Considering this, it is probably just a matter of time before it is. What drives a mom to the Internet is not different from what drives an alcoholic to drink: an empty place that needs filling. \\"In addiction treatment, we talk about the fact that there's a void ,\\"says Moore. \\"Whatever that void may be -- whether it's emotional, spiritual, physical--we're trying to fill it.\\" So, how can you find the void? A journal tracking when and why you go online and what you may be avoiding when you do so can be helpful in finding it out. But what makes Internet dependence special is the fact that usually it is not just a way to escape the tiring parenting or make a connection with others, but also a way to make a statement and be heard. Question: If a mom wants to get rid of Internet addiction, she should _ . Options: A: talk to online friends B: try to fill the empty space in life C: create a new online name D: ask an alcoholic for some advice A:","output":"If a mom wants to get rid of Internet addiction, she should B: try to fill the empty space in life. The article discusses how moms can become addicted to the internet, specifically blogs and social networking, as a means to escape their real-world lives and responsibilities. Coleen Moore of the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery explains that the reason a mom becomes addicted to the internet is similar to what drives an alcoholic to drink: an empty place in their life that needs filling. This void may be emotional, spiritual, or physical. In order to combat internet addiction, it is important for the mom to address and fill this void in her life. Rather than talking to online friends (Option A) or creating a new online name (Option C), which would likely only serve to further perpetuate the addiction, focusing on filling the empty space in one's life would be more beneficial. Finding alternative ways to address their needs, such as joining social groups, engaging in hobbies or exercising, can help break the cycle of addiction and provide a more meaningful and fulfilling life. Asking an alcoholic for advice (Option D) may not be the best choice, as each person's situation and experiences with addiction will be different, and the specific void or issue driving the mom's internet addiction may not be the same as what drives an alcoholic to drink. Professionals like therapists and psychologists that specialize in addiction recovery can provide the most suitable guidance and support in addressing and overcoming internet addiction."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - A given name (also known as a personal name, Christian name, first name, or forename) is a part of a person's full nomenclature. It identifies a specific person, and differentiates that person from other members of a group, such as a family or clan, with whom that person shares a common surname. The term \\"given name\\" refers to the fact that the name usually is \\"bestowed\\" upon a person, normally \\"given\\" to a child by its parents at or near the time of birth. This contrasts with a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name), which is normally inherited, and shared with other members of the child's immediate family. - Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) standard and published as \\"The Unicode Standard\\", the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 128,000 characters covering 135 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). , the most recent version is \\"Unicode 9.0\\". The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium. - A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek \\"sýn\\" (\\"with\\") and \\"ónoma\\" (\\"name\\"). An example of synonyms are the words \\"begin\\", \\"start\\", \\"commence\\", \\"initiate\\", \\"fun\\", \\"pleasing\\" . Words can be synonymous when meant in certain senses, even if they are not synonymous in all of their senses. For example, if one talks about a \\"long time\\" or an \\"extended time\\", \\"long\\" and \\"extended\\" are synonymous within that context. Synonyms with exact meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. Some academics call the former type cognitive synonyms to distinguish them from the latter type, which they call near-synonyms. - A surname or family name is a name added to a given name. In many cases, a surname is a family name and many dictionaries define \\"surname\\" as a synonym of \\"family name\\". In the Western Hemisphere, it is commonly synonymous with last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's given name there. - In the German alphabet, the (traditionally lowercase-only) letter ß, called Eszett or scharfes S, in English \\"sharp S\\", is a consonant that evolved as a ligature of \\"long s and z\\" (z) and \\"long s over round s\\" (s). It is pronounced (see IPA). Since the German orthography reform of 1996, it is used only after long vowels and diphthongs while \\"ss\\" is written after short vowels. The name \\"Eszett\\" comes from the two letters S and Z as they are pronounced in German. Its Unicode encoding is U+00DF. - The long, medial, or descending s () is a form of the minuscule (lower-case) letter \\"s\\", which was formerly used where \\"s\\" occurred in the middle or at the beginning of a word (e.g. \\"infulnes\\" for \\"sinfulness\\" and \\"uccesful\\" for \\"successful\\"). The modern letterform was called the \\"terminal\\", \\"round\\", or \\"short\\" s. - The German orthography reform of 1996 (\\"\\") was a change to German spelling and punctuation that was intended to simplify German orthography and thus to make it easier to learn, without substantially changing the rules familiar to users of the language. - Strauss , Strauß or Straus is a common Germanic surname . Outside Germany and Austria Strauß is always spelled Strauss ( the letter \`\` ß '' is not used in the German - speaking part of Switzerland ) . The families using the Strauss name represent a genetically varied group of people of both Jewish and Germanic origin . The name has been used by families in the Germanic area for at least a thousand years . The overlord of Gröna for example , went by the name of Struz and used the image of an ostrich as his symbol . Examples of it could still be seen on the thousand - year - old church bell of that town . \`\` Struz '' or \`\` Strutz '' is the North - German form of the word \`\` Strauss '' , which is the modern German word for an \`\` Ostrich '' . Some of the earliest Jewish bearers of the name hailed from the Judengasse in medieval Frankfurt , where families have been known by the name of the houses they inhabited . All the houses had names and these included Haus Strauss , complete with an image of an ostrich on the façade . When , for tax purposes , Napoleon made surnames obligatory in 1808 , some more Jewish families decided to adopt the Straus ( s ) name . - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere. - A diphthong (or ; from Greek: , \\"diphthongos\\", literally \\"two sounds\\" or \\"two tones\\"), also known as a gliding vowel, is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets: that is, the tongue (and/or other parts of the speech apparatus) moves during the pronunciation of the vowel. In many dialects of English, the phrase \\"no highway cowboys\\" has five distinct diphthongs, one in every syllable. - In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are , pronounced with the lips pronounced with the front of the tongue pronounced with the back of the tongue pronounced in the throat; and , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and and , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals). Contrasting with consonants are vowels. - An orthography is a set of conventions for writing a language.

The decision means that from December 1, cigarettes and tobacco products must be sold in plain olive green packets with graphic health warnings, such as pictures of mouth cancer and other smoking-related illnesses. Although the impact of Australia on their global business is small, the law could have a major effect if it is adopted as a precedent in other countries, especially the fast-growing economies that cigarette firms see as markets of the future. The laws are in line with World Health Organisation recommendations and are being watched closely by countries including Britain, Norway, New Zealand, Canada and India, which are considering similar measures to help fight smoking. British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the laws in Australia's High Court, claiming the rules were unconstitutional because they effectively extinguished their intellectual property rights. In a brief statement, the High Court said a majority of its seven judges believed the laws did not breach Australia's constitution. A full judgment will be released later. The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 1 billion people around the world are regular smokers, with 80 percent in low- and middle-income countries. Shares in tobacco groups dipped lower with Philip Morris down 0.5 percent in New York and BAT off 1.9 percent and Imperial Tobacco down 1.7 in London. Supporters of the measure hailed the legal victory as an important step for public health in Australia and any other countries that may copy it. Australian Attorney-General Nicola Roxon hailed the ruling as \\"a watershed moment for tobacco control around the world\\". \\"The message to the rest of the world is big tobacco can be taken on and beaten,\\" said Roxon, whose father, a smoker, died of cancer when she was 10. \\"Without brave governments willing to take the fight up to big tobacco, they'd still have us believing that tobacco is neither harmful nor addictive,\\" she said after the ruling. According to the global Tobacco Atlas, a report on smoking produced by the World Lung Foundation and the American Cancer Society, 17 percent of male deaths and 14 percent of female deaths in Australia are due to tobacco. \\"We hope other nations follow Australia's lead and eliminate the use of tobacco packaging as a marketing tool, to help reduce the global tobacco death toll -- which is on track to reach half a billion people this century,\\" said Australia's Cancer Council Chief Executive Ian Olver. FIRST OF MANY BLOODY NOSES? Countries with legal systems similar to Australia's may be among the first to try to copy the packaging logo ban. New Zealand's Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia said the decision gave New Zealand more confidence to push ahead with similar measures. In Britain, which is also considering such steps, anti-smoking and health campaigners welcomed the ruling. \\"This is a major victory not just for Australia but for the world and the first of many bloody noses for the tobacco industry on plain packaging. It should encourage the British government to go ahead with legislation,\\" said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of anti-smoking lobby group Action on Smoking and Health. Britain finished a four-month consultation process on plain packaging last week and will now analyze the thousands of responses it has received. It is expected to make a decision on whether to push ahead with legislation later this year. The Department of Health said no decision had been taken, although Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has been quoted as saying \\"we no longer see smoking as part of life\\" and that he wanted tobacco companies to have \\"no business in the UK\\". Canada, meanwhile, has just implemented graphic warning rules and is watching developments in Australia. \\"At this time, the Department is not planning any regulatory action to require plain packaging for tobacco packages. Health Canada continues to review available research on plain packaging as a form of tobacco control and closely monitors plain packaging proposals put forward in other countries, such as Australia,\\" Olivia Caron, a spokeswoman for Health Canada, said. A spread of plain-package laws to emerging markets, such as Brazil, Russia or Indonesia, could threaten cigarette firms' sales growth. In Indonesia, the government said it would like to follow Australia's example. \\"That's excellent ... this is one way to protect the people,\\" Health Minister Nafsiah Mboi told Reuters. However, anti-tobacco campaigner Tulus Abadi, head of the national commission on tobacco control, said there had been little movement from the government on a draft law to include graphic warnings on cigarette packets like those in Australia. Russia's Rospotrebnadzor, the state consumer protection agency, was not available for comment on Wednesday. But plain-package laws are not likely to come to that country anytime soon, one Russian anti-tobacco analyst said. \\"For now, we (Russia) would not be able to get rid of companies' logos from cigarette packages,\\" said Dmitry Yanin, a Russian anti-tobacco activist and head of the International Confederation of Consumer Societies. \\"But we do hope the ruling will help us implement a law that calls for introduction of graphic images of the effects of smoking on cigarette packages.\\" CHALLENGES Tobacco firms say plain packaging laws violate their intellectual property rights and will stimulate a black market in fake or illegally imported cigarettes. \\"It's still a bad law that will only benefit organized crime groups, which sell illegal tobacco on our streets,\\" British American Tobacco Australia spokesman Scott McIntyre said after the decision. However, he said the firm would comply. Firms can also use free trade arguments against plain packaging laws. Australia is already fighting trade complaints in the World Trade Organization (WTO) from Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, which claim the laws unfairly restrict trade, although their trade with Australia is negligible. Philip Morris said it would launch a legal challenge against the laws under a bilateral Australia-Hong Kong investment agreement. \\"There is still a long way to go before all the legal questions about plain packaging are fully explored and answered,\\" Philip Morris spokesman Chris Argent said in a statement.

The decision is expected to have significant influence globally with both the United Kingdom and New Zealand considering plain packaging. Health experts have hailed the decision as a major victory for global health. It clears the way for the government to impose a ban on all brand marks and logos on cigarettes, to take effect from December this year. Large graphic health warnings will dominate the packs and the manufacturers' brand names will be written in a small generic font. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Australia made a new law that stops cigarette companies from putting their logos on cigarette packs. Instead, the packs must be plain olive green with pictures showing health problems caused by smoking. Some big cigarette companies didn't like this and said it was against their rights, but the highest court in Australia said the law is okay. Now, other countries like the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Canada are thinking about making similar laws.

(A). list was too small.. (B). number was too small..","output":"(C). The numbers were too large... As the school staff struggled to accommodate the growing number of graduating students, it became apparent that the numbers just could not fit into the graduation list. The problem was not necessarily the list itself; rather, it was the sheer number of students completing their education this year – a result of the school's expanding programs and successful outreach initiatives. Step 1: Acknowledge the problem and involve necessary parties The staff called an emergency meeting with the principal, teachers, and other key stakeholders to address the issue at hand, which was the large number of graduating students not fitting into the existing graduation list format. Step 2: Identify potential solutions and weigh their pros and cons Multiple options were considered, including splitting the graduation into separate ceremonies, expanding the capacity of the list, or even reducing font sizes to make it more compact. Each solution had its own merits and drawbacks, so the team had to carefully weigh each one before making a decision. Step 3: Choose the most viable solution Ultimately, the school staff decided to expand the capacity of the list. This would accommodate all the students without making drastic changes to the graduation ceremony itself. It would also minimize the disruptions to the students and their families who had already made plans for the big day. Step 4: Implement the chosen solution With the decision made, the staff quickly went to work updating the list, ensuring that every student was accurately accounted for. The new layout necessitated extra pages, but it effectively addressed the issue of the numbers not fitting. Step 5: Communicate with stakeholders Once the problem was resolved, the staff sent out a communication to the students, parents, and faculty, informing them of the updated graduation list and reassuring them that all graduating students would be properly recognized during the ceremony. Step 6: Reflect and learn from the experience The graduation day went smoothly, with every student proudly walking across the stage to receive their hard-earned diploma. During the following staff debrief, the team acknowledged the need for better planning in the future, especially as the school continued to grow. They committed to developing a more scalable and flexible system for handling graduations, ensuring that similar issues would not resurface in the future."},{"instruction":"I have a new situation: Ken is a scientist who studies atomic systems. He is currently responsible for studying two systems that they are referring to as Omega and Alpha. These two systems are essential to the research that is being done to potentially allow humans to travel to Mars in a reasonable amount of time. Little is known about these systems currently, but scientists have observed that Omega has been steadily gaining more potential energy. Alpha has been rapidly losing potential energy. Ken is hoping to discern why this is happening and try to utilize his findings to further space exploration. But I can use this background: As the atoms first begin to interact, the attractive force is stronger than the repulsive force and so the potential energy of the system decreases, as seen in the diagram. Remember that the lower potential energy increases the stability of the system. As the two hydrogen atoms move closer and closer together, the potential energy continues to decrease. Eventually, a position is reached where the potential energy is at its lowest possible point. If the hydrogen atoms move any closer together, a third interaction begins to dominate and that is the repulsive force between the two positively-charged nuclei. This repulsive force is very strong as can be seen by the sharp rise in energy at the far left of the diagram. What is an answer for this question: Which system is less stable?","output":"To determine which system is less stable, we need to examine the potential energy of each system. Recall that a system is more stable when it has lower potential energy. From the given information: Omega is steadily gaining more potential energy. Alpha is rapidly losing potential energy. So, as Omega gains potential energy, its stability decreases, and as Alpha loses potential energy, its stability increases.

Yet on Thursday Mr Kerr managed to nudge SNP candidates Laura Doherty and Michelle Ferns into third and fourth place respectively. In fact he was only beaten into second place by one of Scottish Labour's most prominent politicians, former council leader Frank McAveety. Mr Kerr's shock win may be partly explained by his own background. He grew up in nearby Cranhill, a \\"really run-down, working class\\" neighbourhood, with his grandparents and mother. It was, he admits, a \\"really tough upbringing\\" but he credits his former secondary school - Eastbank Academy - with giving him the ambition and drive to get into politics. \\"The school motto was 'aim for stars',\\" he said. \\"That was always the expectation I had when I was there.\\" His political curiosity was piqued when he was taken to a protest against the Iraq war by his aunt when he was just 10. \\"She is an SNP supporter and is best friends with (SNP MSP) Christine McKelvie, so I was standing with them,\\" he said. But he initially campaigned for the Scottish Labour party before joining the Conservatives as a young teenager. \\"I decided I wanted to join the Conservative party in 2011, after Ed Miliband was elected to lead the Labour party,\\" he said. \\"I had been campaigning with (former Labour MP) Margaret Curran as she has a fantastic personality. \\"But then some people were telling me that some of my views were a bit more right wing.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation will have an indirect effect on the process of photosynthesis. Step 1: Understanding the perturbation hypothesis - The hypothesis states that there is no rainfall and less sunlight available. Step 2: Analyzing the impact of no rainfall on plant processes - Lack of rainfall means there will be less water available for the plant to absorb through roots. - Water is crucial for photosynthesis, as stated in the process above where water breaks into oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons. Step 3: Analyzing the impact of less sunlight on plant processes - Photosynthesis relies on sunlight to provide the energy needed to break apart water. - With less sunlight, the rate of photosynthesis will decrease as the plant is receiving less energy to carry out the necessary reactions. Step 4: Assessing the overall impact of the perturbation hypothesis - As both rainfall and sunlight are essential components in the photosynthesis process, the absence of rainfall, and reduced sunlight would indirectly hinder photosynthesis. - The lack of water would prevent sufficient water molecules from being broken down, limiting hydrogen, oxygen, and electron production. - Reduced sunlight would limit the energy available for photosynthesis, thus decreasing the overall rate at which the process occurs. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis has an indirect effect on the process of photosynthesis, as it affects two critical components that are necessary for the process to occur efficiently – water and sunlight. Consequently, photosynthesis will likely be negatively impacted by these changes in the environment."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given two statements.

Is it possible to make a new reputation, how? My female 'sc'. Friend is marrying a Hindu baniya man. Boys parents are unaware of this. What should they do?","output":"No, these two questions are not the same. They address two different topics that require separate attention and responses. Let's examine each question in detail: Question 1: Is it possible to make a new reputation, how? This question is centered around the concept of reputation, specifically the possibility of creating a new one and the steps or strategies to achieve that. Reputation can be defined as one's overall character, standing, and social evaluation held by others. People may want to create a new reputation due to various reasons, such as overcoming past mistakes or moving on from a negative public image. To create a new reputation, several measures can be taken: 1. Reflect on the past: Start by understanding the reasons behind your current reputation. Evaluate past actions, decisions, and behaviors that contributed to your current standing. Identify the factors that require change. 2. Set clear goals: Establish what kind of reputation you want to create. Outline specific objectives that will guide your journey to building a new image. 3. Be consistent: Consistent behavior is vital for creating a trustworthy and believable reputation. Stick to your principles and act in alignment with your desired reputation. 4. Foster meaningful relationships: Connect with individuals and groups who share your values and can support your journey. These connections will reinforce your new image, both to yourself and others. 5. Accept responsibility and apologize for past actions: Acknowledge and apologize for any mistakes or wrongdoings that led to your previous reputation. Sincere apologies can help in mending relationships and building trust. 6. Be transparent: Let the people around you know that you are working on creating a new reputation and are committed to change. Transparency aids in building trust and credibility. 7. Give back: Contributing to the community and engaging in charitable activities can help improve your reputation and demonstrate a genuine commitment to change. 8. Be patient: Building a new reputation takes time and consistency. Stay focused on your goals and understand that change may not happen overnight. Question 2: My female 'sc'. Friend is marrying a Hindu baniya man. Boys parents are unaware of this. What should they do? This question is focused on a specific scenario involving a couple of different cultural and religious backgrounds, and the potential complications that can arise from the boy's parents being unaware of this situation. The suggested course of action for managing this case would be as follows: 1. Communication: Encourage your friend and her fiancé to openly discuss their beliefs, customs, and traditions to better understand each other's backgrounds and expectations for their marriage. 2. Prepare: It’s essential to discuss and determine any possible challenges they may face and to identify and agree upon viable solutions together. 3. Address family concerns: If the couple feels comfortable and ready, they should inform the boy's parents of their relationship and plans for marriage. Be honest, respectful, and empathetic in presenting their intentions. Understanding the parents' potential concerns and addressing them upfront can alleviate anxiety and foster mutual respect. 4. Involve elders and mediators, if necessary: If the couple anticipates complications or resistance from the boy's parents, involving trusted elders or mediators can help to facilitate communication and provide guidance. 5. Build bridges: Encourage both families to meet and interact, fostering understanding and empathy between the two families. This will allow both families to get acquainted and better understand each other's values and background. 6. Respect and inclusivity: Both partners should strive to respect and incorporate elements of each other's beliefs, customs, and traditions, as long as they are comfortable with it. This demonstrates respect for the partner's upbringing and can help create a more inclusive environment in the future family unit. In conclusion, both questions address different issues: the first one inquires about the process of creating a new reputation, while the second question deals with an intercultural marriage and family dynamics."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: Asilomar Conference Grounds, location, Pacific Grove, California; Pacific Grove, California, country, United States.

First he offers her an ice cream made of snow and icicle, which she accepts. Next, he tries catching her a fish, but only succeeds in catching a pufferfish. Polly accepts it graciously, but when she swallows it, she begins inflating and deflating repeatedly until Peter makes her spit out the fish, which then returns to water. Peter shrugs in embarrassment, but, feeling humiliated, Polly slaps him and leaves to swim on a small iceberg. On the shore, Peter kicks himself for letting her get away, but then notices a sharkfin moving towards Polly's iceberg. He squawks a danger warning to her, but Polly ignores him, thinking that he's just begging for forgiveness that he won't get. Soon enough, the shark attacks Polly, who swims away in panic. Needing to act, Peter picks up a stick and charges out to help. The shark chases Polly around the bay for several minutes. When it looks like he has her cornered, Peter arrives and clobbers him on the nose. Enraged, the shark starts chasing after Peter. After several minutes of fighting and swimming away from the shark, Peter tries to escape by climbing up onto a cliff with a boulder on top. Peter unintentionally dislodges the boulder, which falls into the shark's mouth, who then swallows it. Due to the boulder's weight, the shark sinks to the bottom of the bay. The shark struggles until he's too tired to move. Passing fish begin to poke fun at him. Meanwhile, Polly and Peter reconcile and fall in love, thus Peter's wooing succeeded.

Combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation: -11 + 369 = 358 So, the equation becomes: 22*z - 456 = 358 2. Add 456 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable z on the left side: 22*z - 456 + 456 = 358 + 456 This simplifies to: 22*z = 814 3. Now, we need to solve for z. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by 22: (22*z) / 22 = 814 / 22 This simplifies to: z = 37 Therefore, the solution for z in the equation 22*z - 456 = -11 + 369 is z = 37."},{"instruction":"Given the question: A light drizzle was falling as my sister Jill and I ran out of the Methodist Church, eager to get home and play with the presents that Santa had left for us and our baby sister, Sharon.

The Ming dynasty () was the ruling dynasty of China – then known as the Great Ming Empire – for 276 years (1368–1644) following the collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. The Ming dynasty was the last imperial dynasty in China ruled by ethnic Han Chinese. Although the primary capital of Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng (who established the Shun dynasty, soon replaced by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty), regimes loyal to the Ming throne – collectively called the Southern Ming – survived until 1683. The Hongwu Emperor (ruled 1368–98) attempted to create a society of self-sufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid, immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty: the empire's standing army exceeded one million troops and the navy's dockyards in Nanjing were the largest in the world. He also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates, enfeoffing his many sons throughout China and attempting to guide these princes through the Huang-Ming Zuxun, a set of published dynastic instructions. This failed when his teenage successor, the Jianwen Emperor, attempted to curtail his uncles' power, prompting the Jingnan Campaign, an uprising that placed the Prince of Yan upon the throne as the Yongle Emperor in 1402. The Yongle Emperor established Yan as a secondary capital and renamed it Beijing, constructed the Forbidden City, and restored the Grand Canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments. He rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats. One, Zheng He, led seven enormous voyages of exploration into the Indian Ocean as far as Arabia and the eastern coasts of Africa. The rise of new emperors and new factions diminished such extravagances; the capture of the Zhengtong Emperor during the 1449 Tumu Crisis ended them completely.

The phrase \\"being stupid\\" can be interpreted in multiple ways. It may be referring to the movie's content, the reviewer's personal opinion, or even the humor or tone of the film. In order to give a detailed answer, more information and context would be needed. For instance, if the reviewer views \\"being stupid\\" as a positive aspect of the movie, it may mean that they enjoyed the movie's simple, light-hearted humor or found it to be an entertaining escape from reality. In this scenario, the review could be considered positive. On the other hand, if the reviewer finds \\"being stupid\\" to be a negative aspect, then it could imply that they thought the movie lacked intelligence or depth, or that the humor was too crude or juvenile. In this case, the review would be considered negative. Other factors, such as the tone of the review and reviewer's known preferences, can also affect the interpretation of this short statement. If the reviewer is known to appreciate quirky humor and generally uses slang casually, then it is more likely that this may have been a positive opinion. However, if the reviewer has a reputation for critical analysis and is known for identifying meaningful content in movies, then the likelihood increases that it may be a negative opinion. Overall, without more information or context, it is impossible to definitively determine whether the review has a positive or negative opinion of the movie.

Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example). - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America.

Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km).

There is a widely held local tradition that St Denys' was used during the English Civil War (1642–51) as a barracks for parliamentary troops who destroyed the interior furnishings. The local historian Trollope stated that the soldiers looted the brass eagle lectern (last recorded in 1622), broke the stained glass windows and the organ, and stole valuables. Whether this damage occurred or not, repairs to the windows and roof were carried out in 1657, paid for by public subscription. Galleries were also added to the church in the 18th century: the south in 1758, west in 1772, and north in 1783–84. In 1772, Edward Evans, a ship's surgeon on HMS Egmont, donated £300 to replace the organ with one built by Samuel Green of London.For most of the 19th century, the Anglican community dominated Sleaford's civic bodies, including the Board of Guardians, who oversaw the workhouse, and the Local Board of Health.

His death at the age of 69 led to an outpouring of grief across the world, as friends, musical collaborators and fans alike shared their memories, stories and Bowie-related recollections. When we asked our readers to share their own Bowie memories, we received hundreds of stories. From catching a first glimpse of the man (often while watching Top of the Pops) to seeing him live in concert over the decades, it’s clear he shaped and inspired many lives. “For a skinny crooked-toothed youth in the early seventies, Bowie was a godsend,” said Jonathan Mark Hauser. “This was a very repressed time, and he made me realize the world was a bigger and more interesting place.” There were also more intimate encounters. It turns out quite a few of our readers met Bowie himself, and have shared a fantastic array of invaluable personal stories that say a lot about the man and the artist. Here are some of our favourites out of the stories we received. It was Guy Fawkes night and the whole band was there. He didn’t eat the pie. My mum, Valerie Jubb, and her flatmates went to Bonnyrigg Regal, just outside Edinburgh, on a Friday night to see him play. The band didn’t show up as they got lost en route from Perth. My mum and her friends waited in the bar to hitch a ride back to Edinburgh. The band showed up late and they got talking. Mum and her flatmates thought “what the hell” and invited them to let off fireworks and for dinner. The band was staying in nearby Broughton and they accepted (her flat was on nearby Northumberland St). Mum pulled out all the stops with a Fray Bentos pie. She says he ate very little and none of the pie – it may have been her cooking apparently! Then they let off fireworks in the garden. [Note for non-UK readers: a quick Google search can probably explain why he didn’t touch the pie.] Space Oddity had just been a hit that summer, I believe. She always said he was incredibly polite but distant. Got the impression he was coming to terms with impending stardom. It’s one of my favourite stories and I’ve very possibly told to everyone who has spent more than five minutes in my company. It never occurred to me he would do something as mundane as dying. Sad day. I regularly had hallucinations about him calling me when he came through Paris. For years I thought it had happened In 1969, when I was only a couple of months old, my Mum visited an old friend Mary Finnigan who was living in Beckenham. I think Mary and my Mum had been at Ealing art school together in the mid 60s and were looking to “catch up” after a few years at either ends of London. When they met up at the house she was staying at, Mary introduced my Mum to a certain David Bowie whom she was having a fling with. And, when they’d gone off for a walk together, they left me in Bowie’s care and, ever the renaissance man, he did the honours when I disgraced myself in the underwear department... I met David Bowie in 1991, in Dublin, on a shoot for [the Tin Machine] video [see main picture]. I was his body painter. Three days later he walked me into my first NA (Narcotics Anonymous) meeting in Dublin. Wherever one went with him, there was always a seismic shift. Space and time changed. Mine, beyond all recognition: Every moment of my reality changed in at moment, on that day. I am now almost 25 years clean and sober. I know I would not be here without that intervention, and all the years working with him, subsequently, reinforced the power of recovery, sobriety and faith in the self. It was the summer of 1965 and I was on holiday in Bournemouth with my friend Valerie. We were 15. The Nashville Teens were playing in a concert with several others and we turned up very early to a completely empty hall. An incredibly handsome young man was practising on stage, talking and moving round. He came over to us and chatted for a while, telling us that he was introducing the different acts and also singing his own song. He was tall, skinny, blonde, totally charming and absolutely charismatic. As people started to arrive he bowed to us, kissed our hands and told us to watch him. Needless to say, we forgot all about the Nashville Teens and were mesmerised by a young Davy Jones ... And thrilled not long afterwards to see him become the famous David Bowie. Eight years later I was a newly qualified teacher in a challenging secondary school and told this story to one of my classes. The next day, the most difficult pupil in the entire school came rushing up to me in the assembly hall. He threw himself to his knees in front of me, grabbed my hand and asked “Miss, is this the hand that was kissed by David Bowie?” He then kissed it in front of the entire school, bowed to me.....and my reputation was assured! My middle name is Jean, so guess which is my favourite song? David and Marc [Bolan] let us play on their instruments. We sat in the kitchen and they held the chords down for us Growing up in Maidstone in the 1960s, we didn’t get up to London much. But one day my parents wanted to go shopping in town so we stayed with my older half-sister who was living in a place with David Bowie and Marc Bolan. She was seeing Tony Visconti, who was working with T Rex at the time. It was 1969 and I was only three, but I’ve got vivid memories of arriving at this big tall building in South London with a huge set of steps. Well, they seemed huge for a three year old. The whole family were there – me, my older brother, my mum and dad – and we stayed the night on the sofa and my sister’s spare mattress. The next morning we all woke up and had breakfast and my sister said she had to go to work. It was then we got introduced to this person – she’d arranged for David Bowie to babysit us. He took my brother and me to the nearby playground where my sister worked and spent the whole afternoon playing with us on the tyre swings. It was a self-contained adventure playground with big mural walls and all kinds of playing frames made out of timber with soft earth in case you fell. Where we played at home there was just a metal swing and metal slide in concrete. I remember the bus journey we took there more than I remember David – we got to sit on the top deck right at the front. My mum would never let us sit there – those Routemasters used to take off while you were still climbing up – but David Bowie said: “Let’s go upstairs!” He was that sort of guy – someone getting on with his life. When we got back to the house, David and Marc let us play on their instruments. We sat in the kitchen and they held the chords down for us as me and my brother strummed. I have an image of Marc Bolan learning over in a cream shirt with burgandy polka dots but all I can remember of David was his guitar – a Gretsch with white and gold plated machine heads. The most bizarre Bowie concert I ever saw was in 1996. It was his first – and last – performance in Russia, at the Kremlin Palace in Moscow. It was a very strange time. Moscow was awash with money and violence as the KGB and the mafia fought over the spoils of the Soviet Union. Bowie landed like an alien in the middle of it all. Suddenly, there was an announcement that David Bowie, this extraordinary Western star, was going to play there – and the new Russian rich came flocking to hear him. So we were in a small concert hall inside the Kremlin, packed with nouveau-riche who had paid a lot of money to see him but had no idea who he was, what he represented or anything about his songs. They were totally bemused, transfixed, glued to their seats but showing no reaction at all – while in the meantime, a few of us at the back were going nuts. It was a characteristically bizarre moment in the life of the most eclectic and brightest star of them all. There was also a period in my life – I think it was 2002-3 after the Heathen Tour – where I regularly had hallucinations about David Bowie calling me when he came through Paris (where I live). He would call, we would meet in a bar and he would ask me what his next musical direction should be! For years I thought it had actually happened. It didn’t! The only possible explanation (no, I was not on drugs) is that the 2002 gig at Le Zenith (as part of the Heathen tour) had such an effect on me that in some sense it infiltrated into my subconscious. Obsessive? Surely not! In 1987, my father – Shane Porteous – was a star of A Country Practice. We knew it was popular in the UK but were still stunned when his agent rang up and said “David Bowie loves the show and would like to meet when he’s over here touring”. We three kids were in our teens, well-familiar with Bowie, and essentially stood over Shane and said “NOT WITHOUT US”. So all four of us got backstage passes and tickets to the show. This is the programme with the backstage “pass” sticker stuck to it. And we met him. I was already in love (teens, pthah) but I stood there and listened to this vibrant, vibrating man with hair that made him taller than my father’s 6 feet talk about wombats in the snow and what it was like being an actor, in that voice ... oh, that voice. He could read the phone book and I’d buy the album. He was so damn plain NICE. And cute (did I mention teens??) and charismatic. Apparently David is (was) unlikely to remember the meeting, due to the 80s being rather ... entertaining ... for him. I shall never forget, and I tell the story at every possible moment because it’s one of the high points of my life. I TOUCHED DAVID BOWIE. Once a week, he’d call me up after a performance, still adrenalined out, and ask to come over to my dumpy apartment My girlfriend and I were just twenty one and twenty three years old respectively, and we both had been working and living in Germany for some time. In the spring of 1983, we decided to get away for a week to the German Alps. We were sitting down to dinner at a restaurant that was off the beaten path, so to speak, and the place was dead. There was only one other couple eating there with two children, when up the gravel path came a couple dressed for the red carpet. They proceeded to sit down at the table next to us and both my girlfriend and I were, to put it politely, shitting our pants. It was David Bowie and Catherine Denuve. Not wanting to appear like idiots, my girlfriend and I went into a quick ‘mind your manners’ huddle and tried our best to act nonchalant about this turn of events. I remembered that his real name was Jones, so I said, “Nice to see you Mr. Jones.” At which point he laughed, and then happily engaged us in conversation over dinner and wine for two hours or so. Disclaimer: I was no fan of David Bowie at this point, I thought he was just another media attention seeking rock star. But, after hearing him speak about art, literature, and culture almost as an academic scholar. I was most impressed. He never once brought up his music or his career. It was almost like having dinner sitting next to a Cambridge Don. As he was leaving the restaurant he shook our hands and thanked us for a lovely evening And then he mentioned that he would be touring this summer, and if we would like tickets to the show, he would make sure that they were left at the gate under my name. I of course said that we would appreciate that, and it was a most kind offer of him to do so for us. So, later that summer: sure enough, the Serious Moonlight Tour was coming to Frankfurt, were we than lived. My girlfriend and I debated whether we should go to the show and see if he kept his promise or not. We were afraid to go, because of the disappointment it might cause, to an otherwise fantastic memory of our encounter. After having a row about this issue, we arrived late to the venue and went to the ticket office desk and asked if Mr. Jones had left tickets with our name on it, expecting the worst. And lo and behold! He left us two VIP passes for us. David Bowie’s stage persona has nothing to do with the artist David Jones. This was the biggest lesson I learned from this encounter. He was a consummate gentleman, witty, funny, and droll in his remarks, and very well read. After meeting him I became a lifetime admirer of the man, and then the artist. Truly a classy Gent. I met David at a party at Jimmy Destri’s (Blondie’s keyboardist) apartment on Jones Street in Greenwich Vlllage in ‘79. We talked for a while about books and music. A couple of days later Coco Schwab, his longtime friend and assistant, called me and invited me to his suite at the Carlyle Hotel. I thought, “Wow. A party at Bowie’s place. I can’t wait to see who’s gonna be there.” followed immediately by, “Wait a minute. I’m nobody. Why have I been invited?” A few evenings later, with much trepidation, I made my way there and knocked on the door. Coco let me in. I walked into the little living room. No one else was there. “I guess I’m early.” “No, you’re right on time. David will be out in a minute.” I looked around. There was a small table set for three. David appeared and immediately picked up our conversation where we’d left off at Destri’s. It took a minute for me to realize that I was to be the only guest. Coco had cooked a delicious dinner for the three of us. We talked into the night and I went back to my place on Perry Street in The Village, not quite believing what had just happened. David returned to New York for a few months to act in The Elephant Man. Once a week or so, he’d call me up after a performance, still adrenalined out, and ask to come over to my dumpy little apartment and shoot the breeze until he got tired. We became good friends. He came to my birthday party that year and gave me a signed first edition of an Edward Gorey book, which he, David, inscribed to me. I still have it. I left NYC in ‘81 shortly after his run in the play ended and quickly lost touch with him. I’ve had no contact with him since. I can’t express adequately how much our short friendship way back then meant to me and still means to me. His conversation and opinions were fascinating and opened a number of artistic and philosophical doors for me. I wasn’t flattered by his friendship, I was improved by it. I guess what I’d like to say is that those qualities of his that stood out to me were that he was unpretentious, intensely intellectual,intellectually hungry, and straight-up honest. An extraordinary man, truly. Rest in peace, David. I am so honored to have known you a little.","output":"David Bowie was a very special musician who many people loved.

The movie was fairly authentic and the characters similar to those same ones at my AIT in 1974. The difference between the Tigerland year, 1971, and mine of 1974 is all the drill sergeants and instructors knew they weren't going back to Vietnam, as it was pretty much all over, so training was very relaxed - not a challenge at all. That was the precursor to all our troubles in the 70s and 80s, which I know for a fact as I stayed in until 2004. I never heard anyone mention \\"Tigerland\\" but the Army did have realistic Vietnam training villages at different bases across the U.S. Vietnam Vets tell me that up to 1972 Basic & AIT could be pretty rough and rugged, because the trainers had been there and were mandated to train Vietnam-bound men those skills to make it, although that was not always the case. Both a drill sergeant at Polk and later one of my Vietnam Vet NCOs, when we had become instructors at a basic training brigade at Fort Bliss, told me there was nothing they could do to get anyone ready and people just had to find out and figure out for themselves.

They appreciate the authenticity of the film, highlighting how the characters and events are similar to the ones they experienced in the military. They also note that their training period was more relaxed than portrayed during the earlier years because, by 1974, it was evident that the war in Vietnam was coming to an end. This caused problems in the military during the 70s and 80s, which the reviewer is well-aware of from their long service until 2004. Even though they have not heard anyone mention \\"Tigerland\\" specifically, they acknowledge the existence of realistic training villages that the Army had set up across the United States. The reviewer also shares the insight provided by Vietnam Vets, who stated that training during earlier years could have been rougher and more challenging. They share the opinion of their former instructors who believed that no amount of training could prepare soldiers for the reality of war – they simply had to find out and figure it out for themselves.

He was born in 1371. Eleven years later, he was caught by the army of a rich young man called Zhu Di and made to work for him. Over time the rich man saw that Zheng He was very clever and strong and they became close friends. In 1403 Zhu Di was made the King of China and he asked Zheng He to join his government. The King wanted to learn more about the world and show other countries his power. He ordered many new ships to be built and made Zheng He their leader. between 1405 and 1433, Zheng He led seven sea trips to different parts of the world. He certainly travelled to India, Africa and the Middle East. A few people think his ships have even reached South America and Australia. Each trip lasted between two and four years and it is believed he sailed more than 50,000 kms during the years of his travels.Zheng He led a fleet with 28,000 men and over 300 ships, such as boats for food, water and even soldiers' horses. On these trips he brought with him many Chinese goods like silk and medicine to give to foreign kings or to sell for local goods. He returned from each trip with boats filled with expensive things such as gold and treasures, foreign guests and strange animals like a giraffe. It is a pity that we may never learn everything about Zheng He' s travels. The Columbus of the east, Zheng He, died in 1433. After that, the new king, had these trips stopped and he burned almost all the books about Zheng He's travels, because he believed the trips were unlucky and too expensive.

It lies east of Stranraer and south of Newton Stewart. It is well known today as \\"Scotland's National Book Town\\" with a high concentration of second-hand book shops. It has a population of about 1,000. - Wigtownshire , was a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918 . It was represented by one Member of Parliament . The first British general election in Wigtownshire was in 1708 . In 1707 -- 08 , members of the 1702 -- 1707 Parliament of Scotland were co-opted to serve in the 1st Parliament of Great Britain . See Scottish representatives to the 1st Parliament of Great Britain , for further details . In 1918 the Wigtownshire area was combined with Kirkcudbrightshire to form the Galloway constituency . - Dumfries and Galloway is one of 32 unitary council areas of Scotland and is located in the western Southern Uplands. It comprises the historic counties of Dumfriesshire, Stewartry of Kirkcudbright and Wigtownshire, the latter two of which are collectively known as Galloway. The administrative centre is the town of Dumfries. - The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Acts of Union by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The Acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved the separate English and Scottish parliaments in favour of a single parliament, located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This lasted nearly a century, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom with effect from 1 January 1801. - Wigtownshire or the County of Wigtown is a registration county and lieutenancy area in south-west Scotland. Until 1975, Wigtownshire was one of the administrative counties used for local government purposes, and is now administered as part of the council area of Dumfries and Galloway. As a lieutenancy area, Wigtownshire has its own Lord Lieutenant, currently John Alexander Ross. - A registration county was, in Great Britain and Ireland, a statistical unit used for the registration of births, deaths and marriages and for the output of census information. In Scotland registration counties are used for land registration purposes. - Galloway (Gaelic: \\"Gall-Ghàidhealaibh\\"; Latin: \\"Gallovidia\\") is a region in southwestern Scotland comprising the counties of Wigtown and Kirkcudbright. - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover. - A Member of Parliament (MP) is the representative of the voters to a parliament. In many countries with bicameral parliaments, this category includes specifically members of the lower house, as upper houses often have a different title. - The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England. In 1066, William of Normandy introduced what, in later centuries, became referred to as a feudal system, by which he sought the advice of a council of tenants-in-chief (a person who held land) and ecclesiastics before making laws. In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which gradually developed into a parliament. - The City of Westminster is an Inner London borough which also holds city status. It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End. It is to the west of and adjoining the ancient City of London, directly to the east of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and its southern boundary is the River Thames. It was created with the 1965 establishment of Greater London. Upon creation, Westminster was awarded city status, which had been previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster. - The 14 British Overseas Territories (BOT) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state. - In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative, elected body of government. Generally a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government (\\"i.e.\\", hearings, inquiries). - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland. The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \\"three estates\\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament taxation, legislation and policy-making but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. - The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom, British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London. - The Acts of Union 1800 (sometimes erroneously referred to as a single Act of Union 1801) united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with effect from 1 January 1801. Both Acts, though since amended, still remain in force in the United Kingdom, but have been repealed in the Republic of Ireland. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, it is also known as the 'heart of British politics'. The Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process is collecting and transporting mixed waste materials from various sources, such as households, commercial establishments, and public spaces. This initial step is crucial in ensuring that the entire subsequent process of sorting, recycling, and disposal can take place efficiently and effectively. During waste collection, waste materials are typically placed into bins or containers by individuals and regularly picked up by waste collection trucks. These waste materials can include various types of recyclable and non-recyclable items such as paper, plastic, metal, glass, organic waste, and electronic waste. The collected waste is then transported to a Material Recovery Facility (MRF) or a waste sorting facility, where the process of separating recyclable materials from non-recyclable items begins. At the MRF, the waste materials go through a series of advanced sorting equipment, such as conveyor belts, magnetic separators, air classifiers, and density separators. These machines help in segregating the waste into distinct categories, making it easier to recover recyclable materials. The recyclable materials, such as paper, plastic, glass, and metals, are then sent to a baler machine, which compacts them into compact bundles called bales for easier transport and handling. Meanwhile, non-recyclable materials or trash that cannot be recovered for recycling, such as composite materials, contaminated waste, and hazardous materials, are separated and transported to a landfill or an incineration facility for appropriate disposal. Once the bales of recyclable materials are ready, they are shipped off to manufacturers who utilize these resources to create new products. This not only helps in reducing the consumption of virgin materials but also has a positive impact on the environment by reducing waste and conserving natural resources. Overall, this entire process of waste management promotes a circular economy, encouraging the reutilization of materials and promoting sustainable practices."},{"instruction":"Premise: An article refutes the accepted wisdom that Klaus Fuchs and David Greenglass leaked the first atomic secrets to the Soviets.

The Royal was warmly received on the podium by Paralympic GB's gold medal winner Aled Davies and Chinese bronze medallist Lezheng Wang. But when it was Mehrdad Karam Zadeh's turn to step up, the 40-year-old failed to offer a hand to the Duchess, clutching them close to his chest. Scroll down for video. Hot on her heels: Kate Middleton presented the medals to the Men's Discus Throwing winners on Sunday. Briefed: St. James's Palace insists the Duchess was warned not to expect a handshake. His decision not to shake hands with the Duchess was likely to have been a result of Iranian cultural. convention which bans such contact between unrelated men and women. The. Duchess appeared to have been briefed on the situation, because she did. not offer her hand either. The incident threatened to overshadow a glittering night for Paralympics GB, which enjoyed its most successful day of the Games so far with seven gold medals. The Iranian delegation in London have not been available to comment on the incident, but according to the Daily Telegraph, they have told Games organisers Zadeh was not making a political statement. It's believed the athlete was merely conforming to Iranian cultural convention, forbidding men from shaking hands with unrelated women. A spokesman for St. James's Palace has revealed the Duchess was briefed beforehand and warned not to offer her hand to Zadeh. Presentation: The Duchess hands over the medal, left, and Zadeh claps his hands to his chest, right. End of the presentation: The Duchess of Cambridge moves away from the athlete. The Islamic rules about touching apply to Muslims and non-Muslims. A man or a woman is only allowed to shake hands, or have similar contact, with someone of the same sex. However, there are several exceptions for close relatives such as brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, and so on. 'Many male athletes from Islamic countries do not shake hands in public with women they are not related to for cultural and religious reasons,' the palace representative said. The palace added Middleton was 'honoured' to get the chance to present the medals, particularly to a British champion in Davies. It put Paralympic GB in second place in the medal table, with 54 in all. The Iranians have said that had the. medal been presented by a man Zadeh would have shaken his hand. Likewise, had the Duchess presented the medal to a female Iranian they would not have hesitated to shake hands. However, it's not the first time the Iranian custom has caused controversy. Last year the Iranian volleyball team had to apologise after several team members shook hands with a female referee after a game against Afghanistan. The gesture provoked outrage and Iran’s state-owned media described the players' behaviour as 'stunning and inappropriate'. Beaming: The Duchess of Cambridge smiles as she hands the gold medal to Aled Davies of Paralympic GB. Shaking hands: The pair have no such issues as Aled Davies enjoys his moment of glory. Podium: Mehrdad Karam Zadeh poses with gold medallist Aled Davies and third placed Lezheng Wang of China. Earlier on Sunday, Kate cheered with delight as Britain's mixed coxed fours crew - David Smith, James Roe, Naomi Riches, Pam Relph and cox Lily van den Broecke - pulled away from their German rivals and crossed the finish line first at Eton Dorney.

The Ukrainian athlete who was ordered to give back her discus gold medal because of a scoring blunder did not turn up to the rearranged ceremony at the Olympic Stadium this morning. Mariia Pomazan stayed away in apparent protest as the gold she had been presented with on Friday was awarded to China's Wu Qing. The 23-year-old was demoted to silver and the place on the podium reserved for the second-placed athlete remained empty. She admitted yesterday she was 'very, very angry' after losing her gold in the F35/36 class, with organisers announcing the wrong medals had been awarded. Points rather than distance determined the final standings in the combined-class event. She revealed those feelings had been behind her shot put gold yesterday. All three athletes who received medals on Friday were asked to return them, with an appeal by the Ukrainian National Paralympic Committee for the original result to stand rejected by the jury of appeal. An International Paralympic Committee spokesman said: 'Since Friday we have tried to investigate if an alternative could be found that suited all parties that was within the rules.

After Potts' arrival and arrest in Miami, Potts' family said they feared he had made an error by handing himself over. \\"It's taking a toll on my family to think he might go to prison again,\\" Mekoda Potts, his brother, told CNN. \\"They are trying to put him away for another 20 years? It's not right.\\" But according to recent court documents, the hijacker has been meeting with prosecutors and may soon agree to a plea deal. \\"In all likelihood this case will be resolved without the necessity of a jury trial,\\" assistant public defender Robert Berube said in court documents. \\"However obtaining the potential discovery in this case is complicated.\\" The discovery includes documents from the State Department that could back Potts' assertion that he already spent more than a decade in a Cuban jail for the hijacking. On Wednesday, a federal judge agreed to postpone the start of Potts' trial from December to March to give his attorneys more time to obtain those documents. A militant past. Nearly 30 years ago, Potts was a black militant hoping to overthrow the United States government by violent means. After smuggling a pistol aboard Piedmont Airlines flight in a fake cast, Potts threatened to kill everyone aboard the plane if the pilot didn't divert the aircraft to Cuba. \\"We are all going to hell or Cuba,\\" Potts said he told the pilot of the Miami-bound flight. In Cuba, Potts said, he believed he would be given military training by the government to carry out his armed struggle in the United States. Instead, Potts was tried by the Cubans for the hijacking and sentenced to 15 years in jail. Potts said he served more than 13 years in Cuban jail and then nearly two more years under a conditional release program. During that time, he said, he received regular visits from U.S. diplomats. Those visits could be key to a possible reduction of the 20 years to life-sentence that Potts now faces in the United States. \\"I am sure that any American can understand that 15 years in prison in a communist country is 15 years,\\" Potts told CNN in October. \\"It's not a club med situation.\\" Potts had petitioned U.S. authorities for more than a year to be able to return to the United States, even though he still faced air piracy charges there. The hijacker said he wanted to return home to see family, including the two daughters he had in Cuba and then sent to live in the United States. In November, U.S. authorities issued Potts a single-use passport and arranged for two American diplomats to escort him from Havana to Miami. \\"I understand I will be taken into custody, after that I don't know what to expect,\\" Potts told CNN aboard the plane flight from Havana. \\"That act of terrorism that I did has come back to haunt me every day.\\" FBI agents arrested Potts as he stopped off the plane.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When thinking about Diablo III, it's essential to consider the various editions and platforms on which this game was released. The first version that comes to mind is the original PC release, which was launched in May 2012. However, when discussing console versions, it's crucial to acknowledge that there is an initial console release of the game, too. Diablo III was first released on consoles for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2013. This version is what we can refer to as the original console version of Diablo III because it predates any other console-released editions, such as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions. It's worth mentioning that the original console version does not include any expansion content, such as the Reaper of Souls expansion and the Rise of the Necromancer pack, which were released later. So, when seeking an original gameplay experience of Diablo III on a console, you would be looking for the original console version, which is Diablo III for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360."},{"instruction":"Short general knowledge question: what political party did john bell belong to?

What is a 1986 Argentine drama-science fiction film written and directed by Eliseo Subiela, that has uncredited adaptations made from it to a 2001 American science fiction-mystery film based on Gene Brewer's 1995 novel ? The answer is:","output":"The 1986 Argentine drama-science fiction film written and directed by Eliseo Subiela that shares uncredited similarities with a 2001 American science fiction-mystery film based on Gene Brewer's 1995 novel is \\"Hombre Mirando al Sudeste\\" (Man Facing Southeast). \\"Hombre Mirando al Sudeste\\" tells the story of Rantés, a man who suddenly appears in a Buenos Aires psychiatric hospital claiming to be an alien from another planet. He has a mission to save humanity from itself. While the institution's psychiatrist, Dr. Julio Denis, initially dismisses Rantés as a delusional patient, he soon becomes fascinated by the strange man and begins to entertain the possibility that Rantés might indeed be telling the truth. Throughout the film, Rantés demonstrates inexplicable powers and insights, ultimately forcing Dr. Denis to confront his own beliefs and understanding of reality. The 2001 American science fiction-mystery film inspired by Gene Brewer's 1995 novel is \\"K-PAX,\\" directed by Iain Softley. The film stars Kevin Spacey as Prot, a man claiming to be an alien from the planet K-PAX, and Jeff Bridges as Dr. Mark Powell, a psychiatrist at the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute where Prot is a patient. Like \\"Hombre Mirando al Sudeste,\\" \\"K-PAX\\" centers around the relationship between the mysterious patient and the psychiatrist as they grapple with questions about the patient's true identity, the nature of reality, and the limits of human understanding. Though \\"K-PAX\\" is officially based on Gene Brewer's novel, the similarities between the Argentine film \\"Hombre Mirando al Sudeste\\" and \\"K-PAX\\" have led to claims that the latter film borrowed heavily from the former without giving due credit. The core storylines, themes, and character dynamics in both films are strikingly similar, sparking discussions on intellectual property and the ethics of adapting international films. In conclusion, the 1986 Argentine drama-science fiction film \\"Hombre Mirando al Sudeste,\\" directed by Eliseo Subiela, has uncredited adaptations made from it to the 2001 American science fiction-mystery film \\"K-PAX,\\" which is officially based on Gene Brewer's 1995 novel. Both films explore the relationships between a mysterious patient claiming to be an extraterrestrial and their psychiatrists, delving into the nature of reality, belief, and the human psyche."},{"instruction":"Dacă vor adoptate, aceste amendamente vor contribui la prevenirea neregularităţilor electorale, inclusiv a celor legate direct de finanţare.

A). yes; B). no;","output":"Answer: The site for Bermuda's Remembrance Day is the Cenotaph War Memorial located in front of the Cabinet Building on Front Street in the City of Hamilton, Bermuda. This memorial honors Bermudian men and women who served and died in both World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945). Remembrance Day is not only celebrated in Bermuda but as well as in several other countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia to remember the members of their armed forces who have died in the line of duty. It is marked annually on November 11th to recognize the end of hostilities of World War I on that date in 1918. The day is observed with a two-minute silence at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. In Bermuda, a Remembrance Day Parade and Service is held, bringing together veterans, serving soldiers, cadets, and other uniformed service organizations to honor the fallen. The parade proceeds along Front Street culminating at the Cenotaph War Memorial, where there is a wreath-laying ceremony with various government officials, military representatives, and other organizations paying their respects. The Cenotaph War Memorial is a simple granite structure, composed of a large, central obelisk with three stepped-base around it. On the front side, the inscription reads: \\"1914-1918 To The Immortal Memory Of The Men Of The Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps Who Gave Their Lives In The Great War.\\" The north and south faces of the memorial bear the names of Bermudians who died during World War I, while the back has an additional inscription for the fallen in World War II, stating: \\"In commemoration also of those who gave their lives in World War II, 1939 to 1945.\\" In addition to the Cenotaph War Memorial, other sites around the island also host Remembrance Day activities, including memorial services at St. George's, the eastern end of the island, and at Somerset in the west.

They might believe that learning Hebrew would have been more beneficial, enjoyable, or relevant to their interests and needs compared to their experience of studying Latin. This preference offers a basis to analyze whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I would have rather studied Hebrew instead of Latin.\\" To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, let's break down the meaning of both statements and examine their relationship: 1. The premise: \\"I wish I had studied Hebrew rather than Latin\\" – This statement is retrospective and conveys a sense of regret or longing for a different past decision. It implies that the person has already studied Latin and now wishes they had chosen to study Hebrew instead. Their preference for learning Hebrew over Latin is driven by reasons that are not mentioned explicitly, but these can be inferred as potential motivators for their preference. 2. The hypothesis: \\"I would have rather studied Hebrew instead of Latin\\" – This statement reflects the person's preferences and places them in a hypothetical scenario where they could have chosen between studying Hebrew or Latin. It establishes their imagined preference for Hebrew over Latin had they been given the opportunity to decide which language to study. The relationship between the premise and hypothesis can be understood as one of logical entailment. It means that the truth of the premise implies the truth of the hypothesis. If the person genuinely wishes they had studied Hebrew rather than Latin, then it is reasonable to assume that this preference would be reflected if they had been given a choice between learning Hebrew or Latin, as the hypothesis asserts. In conclusion, if the premise \\"I wish I had studied Hebrew rather than Latin\\" is true, it does entail the hypothesis \\"I would have rather studied Hebrew instead of Latin.\\" This is because both statements reflect the same underlying preference for Hebrew over Latin. The premise demonstrates this preference retrospectively and invokes a sense of regret, while the hypothesis presents it as a forward-looking hypothetical scenario. The validity of the premise and its entailment of the hypothesis suggests that their preference for Hebrew is genuine and would have influenced their decision if they had the option to choose between studying either language."},{"instruction":"Two-Face Translate to Finnish Finnish:","output":"Two-Face on kuvitteellinen hahmo, joka esiintyy DC Comicsin sarjakuvissa ja on yksi Batmanin tunnetuimmista ja vaarallisimmista vihollisista.

In this case, we will list all elements of A before the last 2 elements. To achieve this, we need to follow these steps: 1. Determine the length of the list A. (len(A)) 2. Calculate the index of the element we need to end at by subtracting i from the length of A. (len(A) - i) 3. Iterate through the list A from the beginning until the calculated index in step 2. 4. Create a new list to store the elements that precede the last i elements, and add the elements in the loop from step 3. Applying these steps to the given input: 1. len(A) = 10 2. len(A) - i = 10 - 2 = 8 3. Iterate through A from the beginning (index 0) until index 8 (exclusive). 4.

Team A studied alcoholic fermentation, while team B learned more about lactic fermentation. They later organised a trivia contest between teams. But I can use this background: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy.

At which European winter sports resort is the Cresta Run?","output":"The Cresta Run is located in the European winter sports resort of St. Moritz, situated in the Engadine Valley in the southeastern part of Switzerland. St. Moritz is a well-known destination for winter sports enthusiasts, offering a wide array of activities such as skiing, snowboarding, ice skating, and tobogganing. The resort has played host to multiple Winter Olympic Games as well, specifically in 1928 and 1948. The Cresta Run, in particular, is a world-famous ice tobogganing track with a rich history that dates back to 1884. It was initially built by a group of British tourists led by Major W. H. Bulpett, who introduced the exciting and daring sport of \\"skeleton\\" tobogganing to the area. The run was named after the Cresta Valley between Celerina and St. Moritz, where it is located. The Cresta Run stretches for 1,212 meters (3,976 feet) and features ten distinct curves, each having a unique name: Church Leap, Wall, Shuttlecock, Corner Five, Battledore, Bulpett's Bridge, Dracula, White Horse, Scylla, and Charybdis. These bends challenge participants as they navigate the icy course at thrilling speeds, often reaching up to 80 mph (130 km/h). Traditionally, the Cresta Run is not open for public use, and access is restricted to the members of the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club (SMTC) and their guests. However, during certain dates within the winter season, non-members can try their hand at tobogganing on the famed track through the SMTC's \\"Introduction to the Cresta\\" program, which is designed to give novices a taste of the sport. The Cresta Run has built up a legendary reputation over the years, not only for its breathtaking speed and complexity but also for its unique place in the history of winter sports. At St. Moritz, its presence contributes significantly to the resort's appeal and international prestige, attracting adventure-seekers and winter sports aficionados from around the globe."},{"instruction":"Data: Akita Museum of Art, country, Japan; Akita Museum of Art, location, Akita, Akita; Akita, Akita, isPartOf, Akita Prefecture; Japan, ethnicGroup, Filipinos in Japan; Japan, leader, Shinzō Abe Sentence about the following data:","output":"The Akita Museum of Art, located in Akita, Akita Prefecture, is a prominent cultural institution in Japan, a country led by Shinzō Abe and home to various ethnic groups, including Filipinos."},{"instruction":"Article: Mr. Black, Ann's father works in a hospital.

Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith).

D'Artagnan is in a hurry to confront his enemy, Rochefort, and in his haste, he offends each of the Musketeers individually. As a result, he agrees to duel each of them separately before realizing that all three duels are with members of the same group. When the Musketeers arrive at the designated dueling location, they find it amusing that they were all preparing to fight the same person, d'Artagnan. However, the situation turns serious when Cardinal Richelieu's guards arrive and attempt to arrest the Musketeers for illegally dueling.

So, when you see a '+' symbol, you must perform subtraction, and when you see a '-' symbol, you need to perform addition. Here's the given arithmetic expression: 1744 + 4800 - 4688 + 2637 - 1656 - 4459 - 9618 + 4120 To follow the guidelines provided, let's swap the symbols: 1744 - 4800 + 4688 - 2637 + 1656 + 4459 + 9618 - 4120 Now, simply solve the expression by performing the arithmetic operations: 1. 1744 - 4800 = -3056 2. -3056 + 4688 = 1632 3. 1632 - 2637 = -1005 4. -1005 + 1656 = 651 5. 651 + 4459 = 5110 6. 5110 + 9618 = 14728 7. 14728 - 4120 = 10608 So, the answer is 10608."},{"instruction":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation","output":"To analyze the given review and determine whether it has a positive or negative opinion of the movie, I will first break down the review and evaluate its key points: 1. \\"Wooden delivery\\": This phrase generally means that the acting in the movie is stiff and lacking in emotion or naturalness. This is a negative point. 2. \\"Substantial arc of change\\": This suggests that the story tries to portray significant character development or plot progression. However, the context matters, so we will keep this in mind as we look at the next part of the review. 3. \\"Doesn't produce any real transformation\\": This part indicates that despite the movie attempting to show an arc of change, there is no actual transformation or depth in the characters or story. Based on these key points, I can conclude that the review has a negative opinion of the movie. The reviewer appears to criticize the acting as being wooden and feels that the movie fails to deliver a meaningful transformation despite its efforts."},{"instruction":"Fact 1: Aship is used for moving people across bodies of water.

Explanation: The paragraph says \\"We see an opening title screen. a boat\\" so we know there might be a boat and something happening with it. Now, let's see why other answers are wrong: 1). In answer 1, it says \\"are shown floating in the water.\\" It should be \\"a boat\\" instead of \\"are.\\" So, it doesn't make sense for what happens next. 2). Answer 2 says \\"is pulling a man out of his cabin perch.\\" But the paragraph doesn't mention anything about a man or cabin. So, this option isn't related to the story. 4). In answer 4, it says \\"is underwater trying to swim,\\" which doesn't make sense because boats don't swim. They float on the water. That's why answer 3 is the best choice: it continues with the boat and adds more details, like divers underwater and sealife."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

Options: - thrift store - clothing store - costume shop - shopping mall - laundromat The answer is \\"laundromat\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"laundromat\\" because a laundromat is a facility specifically designed to provide washing, drying, and sometimes folding services for clothes, which is precisely what you needed when your electricity was cut off. Laundromats are equipped with multiple washing machines and dryers that operate using either coins or cards, depending on the specific establishment. They offer a convenient and efficient way to clean your clothes without having to rely on the availability of electricity in your home. Exploring the other options briefly: 1. Thrift store - A thrift store is a type of second-hand shop that sells used or pre-owned items at discounted prices. While you may be able to find affordable clothing here, thrift stores do not typically have facilities for customers to wash or dry their clothes. 2. Clothing store - A clothing store is a retail establishment that sells new clothes and various other fashion items. While they may have a wide variety of stylish options for purchase, they do not provide laundry services, as their primary focus is on sales and not assisting with the process of washing existing clothes. 3. Costume shop - A costume shop is a specialized retail store that offers costumes, accessories, and other items related to dressing up for various occasions, such as costume parties or Halloween. They do not have washing facilities and therefore would not be a suitable option for laundering your jeans. 4. Shopping mall - A shopping mall is a large enclosed building containing a variety of retail shops, eateries, and other services. Although it is possible to find clothing stores and, in some cases, even a laundromat within a shopping mall, the mall as a whole is not a place specifically designed for washing clothes. Therefore, while the laundromat may be present in the mall, the correct answer is still \\"laundromat\\" as it is the facility that provides the service you needed. In conclusion, when faced with the need to wash your jeans after having your electricity cut off, the most suitable and practical option among the given choices would be a laundromat. This type of establishment is specifically designed to provide customers with an accessible and efficient way to clean their clothes without relying on household electricity or appliances."},{"instruction":"Complete the passage: pick from possible candidates.

Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","output":"No, the suggested answer is not valid for the question provided as it does not address the actual inquiry regarding the effect of egg substitutes on a cake. Let me provide a detailed answer to the proper question: The question asked is about the impact of using egg substitutes on a cake and whether one should validate or consider this potential change in ingredients. When using egg substitutes in a cake recipe, several factors should be taken into consideration: 1. Binding and Structure: Eggs play a significant role in binding the ingredients together and providing structure to the cake. Egg substitutes may vary in the strength of their binding ability, which could result in a difference in the overall texture and structure of the cake. 2. Moisture: Eggs provide moisture to the cake, which is crucial for a soft and tender texture. Depending on the specific egg substitute used, the moisture content might be affected. Some substitutes may retain more moisture, leading to a denser cake, while others may not provide enough moisture, resulting in a drier cake. 3. Leavening: Eggs contribute to the leavening process in cakes, which helps to achieve the desired rise and light, airy texture. Egg substitutes may have different leavening abilities due to their chemical composition, so using a substitute could affect the cake's rise and overall fluffiness. 4. Flavor and Color: Eggs not only affect the cake's texture but also contribute to its flavor and color. Using an egg substitute might slightly alter the taste and appearance of the cake, depending on the specific type of substitute used. 5. Potential Allergies and Dietary Restrictions: Some individuals may have egg allergies or follow a dietary lifestyle that excludes eggs, such as veganism. In these cases, using egg substitutes is necessary to accommodate these needs, and it is essential to find an adequate substitute that will achieve the desired outcome for your specific cake recipe. It is essential to validate and choose the appropriate egg substitute based on the specific cake recipe you are working on. There are several egg substitutes available on the market, as well as homemade alternatives such as applesauce, yogurt, mashed bananas, or silken tofu, among others. Each of these substitutes has its unique characteristics, and some may be more suitable for specific types of cakes. For example, silken tofu may work well for dense, moist cakes, while baking powder and vinegar mixture could be a more appropriate choice for lighter cakes. In conclusion, using egg substitutes in a cake could affect its structure, texture, flavor, and appearance. It is crucial to consider the desired outcome and specific recipe requirements to choose an appropriate egg substitute that will yield the best results."},{"instruction":"Komissiolla pitäisi olla peruuttamisoikeus prosessin alkuvaiheissa, kuten sillä onkin.

Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping \\"wasn't very obvious\\" due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface, even by the video tutorial added on the RTM release (which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides).

Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

It may not even sneak into the top fifty. But rather than discredit the film for not being as good as so many other classics of the film noir genre, it should be noted that 'Phantom Lady' has enough strong and lasting images in it to make it a worthwhile viewing. All that is required from the viewer is the ability to get beyond the dreadfully slow beginning. The film doesn't get cooking until 'Kansas' (Ella Raines) sets about trying to prove all but single handedly the innocence of her boss, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who has been convicted of murder. 'Kansas' is Anderson's secretary by day and amateur detective by night. As the novice sleuth she does quite well for herself while working the streets of New York at night. Little by little she starts putting pieces of a murder mystery puzzle together. To be honest, the film belongs to Raines and it is only due to her presence that the film works well at all. Somehow she is able to breathe life into a film about a condemned man who is not interesting in the slightest. I'm not sure if this splintered dynamic of a characterless leading man becomes the fault of the actor or the director, but clearly this is where something becomes terribly wrong with the film. As interesting as Raines is as a novice detective, things really accelerate into another hidden gear when 'Kansas' pays a late night visit to a wandering drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) in search of some information to help her condemned boss. She and the drummer paint the town a new kind of red while visiting the \\"all night\\" jazz clubs. Trying to describe this scene will either prove an injustice to the scene or worse yet, it could ruin the scene all together. You'll know the scene once the last cymbal crash has finished ringing out. If you're lucky enough to have this film on DVD, you'll more than likely be rewinding this scene again and again. As good as Raines is, it is this scene that makes this film noteworthy. It is mainly because of this scene that I rate 'Phantom Lady' a 7 instead of a 6. For the most part this film comes off as tepid and bland with a few great scenes and one magnificent scene. It is the 'drum/sex scene' that separates this film from any others of the same ilk. And just like it is said in the film that \\"you never go wrong with Vanilla\\", I would also like to add that \\"going with Vanilla\\" is the safe fall back choice when one can't decide on having a tastier treat. 7/10.

After a few years, the price of the box of toys becomes much cheaper, like half the price. The sentence is saying that a brand new Cadillac car is like that big box of toys - it's expensive when it's new, but after three years, the price drops a lot. So, let's look at the possible answers for the question about whether you can afford this big box of toys (or new Cadillac) right now: (1) Yes - This means that the sentence tells us that you can't afford the new Cadillac at the moment. This matches the situation with the box of toys being too expensive when new. (2) It is not possible to tell - This means we can't say for sure if you can or cannot afford it. (3) No - This means that the sentence does not tell us anything about being able to afford the new Cadillac. Since the sentence talks about how the new Cadillac is too expensive (like the box of toys), the best answer would be (1) Yes, because it matches the situation that you can't buy the new Cadillac (or the big box of toys) at the moment due to its high price."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you will be given a short story.

But despite the government's attempts to promote sustainable practices, illegal logging is continuing apace. A 2012 World Bank report estimates that 80% of Peruvian timber export stems from illegal logging. The Peruvian government requires loggers to show that the timber came from areas where logging is allowed. In theory, they are required to show that the wood they have cut comes from an area where a logging concession was granted and to document how much was cut. But the remoteness of the areas where illegal loggers operate and the fact that the authorities rarely patrol these areas mean the potential for illegal logging is vast. Photojournalist Fellipe Abreu travelled to north-eastern Peru and spent time with the illegal loggers. They told him how they circumvented the rules. The Javari river marks the border between Peru and Brazil. Illegal loggers use the river like a highway to float logs they have illegal extracted from the forest to the tri-border area to the north, where Peru, Brazil and Colombia meet. The high prices which timber can fetch on the international markets has fuelled a logging boom. Villages such as Nueva Esperanza, meaning New Hope, have sprung from this boom. Almost all of its 300 residents make a living either directly or indirectly from logging. Most are loggers themselves, or the families of loggers, others are merchants who rely on loggers to purchase goods from them. Paulo (not his real name, in camouflage top), his brother-in-law, nephew and son venture into the forest to cut down trees. Paulo is employed by the mayor's office in Atalaia do Norte, in Brazil. He also teaches at a school in Palmeiras do Javari, an army base on the Brazilian side of the border, but he sometimes engages in logging to boost his income. The boundaries between what is legal and illegal are not always clear cut in this area, he explains. He has come to the Peruvian side of the forest for a few days hunting and to cut down some cedars - neither of which is allowed under the law. It is not the first time Paulo and his brother-in-law have come to hunt and cut down trees in Fray Pedro, an indigenous reserve inhabited by the Matses community near the Soledad river in Peru. According to Paulo, the way to go about it is to come to an arrangement with the local indigenous leader. He explains that in he past he has cut down 30 cedars in exchange for offering the local leader a day's work, but he adds, other forms of payment are also accepted. Illegal loggers have built small camps deep inside the jungle, a base from which they can go about their daily business. This camp is two hours by boat from the Brazilian army base of Estirao do Equador. The loggers have built their huts on the shores of the Esperanza river, on the Peruvian side of the border. Facilities are basic, leaves are used to thatch roofs for shelter and there is a communal kitchen where the men eat a hearty breakfast before a long day's logging. In the evenings, they play cards to pass the time. The camp leader says police from the nearest post came to see them when they first set up their huts. He recalls how they came to an agreement with the officers to pay them 1,000 soles (350; Â£210) at the end of the season for the police to turn a blind eye to their activities. \\"That's how it works here,\\" he explains. Once felled, the logs are cut into four chunks, each approximately four metres (13 ft) in length. A team of six men rolls the log to the nearest stream. One uses a stick for leverage, while the other five push. They leave the logs in a dry riverbed. When the next heavy rain falls, the logs float and are collected in a bend for transport downriver. The loggers wait until they have amassed hundreds of logs before making the journey. When the water levels are high enough and a sufficient number of logs has been felled, a foreman gathers all the logs and ties them together into a big floating raft. He pays off the local loggers and takes the wood downstream to the Islandia, a Peruvian town in the border area with Brazil and Colombia. In Islandia, sawmills buy the wood off the foreman and process it further. The illegal loggers and their foremen have found ingenious ways of circumventing the rules and still providing the necessary paperwork required by the buyers. Some will have bought the required licences off other loggers and altered the documents so as to suggest the wood came from an area where a logging licence was granted. Others, who have licences for a certain area of the forest, will take wood from outside that area and pretend it comes from the licensed plot. Often, the wood will be cut down in neighbouring Brazil and floated across the river to Peru to hide its provenance. It is a practice known as \\"wood laundering\\" among the loggers. By the time it reaches Islandia, the wood - much of it illegally felled - will appear legal and be ready for export to the United States and countries in Europe. A summary of the above article is?","output":"Illegal logging continues to thrive in the rainforests of the Peruvian Amazon, despite the government's attempts to promote sustainable practices.

I'm not saying that I am not an example of this, but I wonder how people can spend so much time on their phones without actually talking to anyone in particular. We can now do almost anything with a phone. But has it gone too far? We spend too much time on our mobiles but not enough time talking to people in real life. Last time I visited London, I traveled by subway. I noticed that almost everybody else was on their phones except those who were asleep. People were playing games, reading articles and listening to music. Recently, my smart phone broke and I had to use an old basic phone just to keep in touch with my family and friends. I could only send text messages, make calls and play one game with it. And I loved it. I loved being free from the Internet, and I really didn't mind what my friends were doing or what the latest news was.

The European Greenfinch, or just Greenfinch (Chloris chloris) is a small songbird of the finch family, Fringillidae. This bird species is widespread across Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. In appearance, the male Greenfinch primarily features a green-yellow plumage with prominent yellow markings on its wings and tail. The female, on the other hand, is more subdued in coloration, bearing greyish-brown plumage with faint yellow on the wings and tail. They primarily inhabit gardens, farmlands, woodlands, and hedgerows. The European Greenfinches are seed eaters, with a particular liking for sunflower seeds and peanuts. During the breeding season, they also feed their chicks with insects. Their song is a pleasant, twittering melody, and during flight, they emit a sharp 'dju-dju' sound. These birds have a peculiar way of drinking, by dipping their bill into the water and then lifting their heads to let the water trickle down their throat. As a population, the European Greenfinch has faced threats due to diseases, particularly the Trichomonosis outbreak which negatively impacted their numbers. However, they remain widely distributed, and numerous conservation efforts are in place to ensure their survival. The term \\"Viherpeippo\\" is therefore a representation of a notable part of Finland's native wildlife, deeply embedded in the local ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","output":"Sentence: The quick brown fox gracefully leaped over the ambitious young entrepreneur while he sketched an innovative design for a solar-powered vehicle near the serene riverside park.

Here's the reasoning: - Sentence A: \\"The bacteria community thrives on a piece of bread\\" makes sense because bacteria can form communities called biofilms or colonies where they flourish together by breaking down and consuming the organic matter found in the bread. This is a common understanding of how bacteria behave. - Sentence B: \\"The bacteria society thrives on a piece of bread\\" is against common sense because the term \\"society\\" typically implies a group of organisms with complex interactions and organization, such as humans or animals. Using the term \\"society\\" for bacteria anthropomorphizes them, which is not accurate.

Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army. In May 1803, the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804. Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts, Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States, instantly doubling the size of the U.S. The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre, a total of 15 million. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): Who was the de facto ruler of Saint-Domingue in 1801?","output":"The de facto ruler of Saint-Domingue in 1801 was Toussaint Louverture."},{"instruction":"I can use this background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century.

Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Now, I have a new situation: Mary and Ann got some fruit as a gift from a friend.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The atom has a higher atomic number happens, how will it affect Less glucose can be produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having an atom with a higher atomic number can potentially have an indirect effect on the process of glucose production during photosynthesis and the overall efficiency of the process. To fully understand the impact of this perturbation, we need to dive deeper into understanding the various aspects involved in the process: 1. Chlorophyll - Chlorophyll is a pigment that is essential for photosynthesis. It is responsible for the green color of leaves, as it can easily absorb sunlight. The pigment is composed of a chlorin molecule with a central magnesium (Mg) ion, which is crucial for the absorption of sunlight. 2. Photosynthesis - The process consists of two main stages, the light-dependent reaction, and the light-independent reaction (also known as the Calvin Cycle). During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight is absorbed by the chlorophyll molecules, which generates energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). That energy is later used for the synthesis of glucose during the light-independent reactions. Now, let's analyze the perturbation hypothesis: If an atom with a higher atomic number replaces the magnesium ion in the chlorophyll molecule, several effects could occur: 1. Alteration of chlorophyll properties - Since chlorophyll has a highly specific structure, introducing an atom with a higher atomic number will likely alter its properties, which could affect its ability to absorb sunlight efficiently. This change could lead to a decrease in the amount of sunlight absorbed by the plant, ultimately resulting in less available energy for photosynthesis. 2. Disruption of the photosynthesis process - The change in the structure and properties of chlorophyll could also lead to a disruption in the photosynthesis process. It might hinder the transfer of energy between chlorophyll molecules, resulting in a decrease in the generation of ATP and, ultimately, less glucose production during the light-independent reactions. 3. Impact on plant growth and overall health - With less glucose being produced, the plant may struggle to generate enough energy for growth and maintenance. This could lead to stunted growth, reduced ability to compete for resources, or even death. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis involving an atom with a higher atomic number could have an indirect effect on the process of glucose production during photosynthesis. However, the magnitude of the effect will depend on how significantly the new atom affects the molecular properties of chlorophyll and the efficiency of the photosynthesis process. Further research and experimentation would be needed to determine whether this perturbation could have a substantial impact on plant growth and overall health."},{"instruction":"Context: In week 16, the Lions visited the Cincinnati Bengals on Christmas Eve to finish their road schedule.

Article: SHANGHAI, June 7(AP)--A 16-year-old girl's suicide after she was barred from a key exam draw attention to increasing worries over academic pressures, as millions of Chinese students began annual college entrance tests on Wednesday. The three-day exam, viewed as important to future career and financial success, has a record 9.5 million high school students across prefix = st1 /Chinacompeting for just 2.6 million university places. For kids and parents alike, it's a difficulty that experts say causes extreme emotional distress. \\"Pressure from study and exams is a top reason for psychological problems among Chinese youth,\\" said Jin Wuguan, director of the Youth Psychological Counseling Center at Shanghai'sRuijinHospital. In China's increasingly success oriented, pressure-cooker cities, academic stress is seen as a rising cause of youth suicides and even murders of parents by children who are driven crazy by intolerable pressure to perform. According to her family and newspaper accounts, 16-year-old Wu Wenwen drowned herself after she was stopped at the exam room door because her hair wasn't tied back as her school required. Returning in tied hair, she was then told the end-of-term exam had already started and she was too late to take it. In tears, Wu called her mother, and then disappeared. Her body was found the same night in a nearby lake. China doesn't keep comprehensive statistics on student suicides, but Jin said health care professionals see the problem worsening, even among elementary students. Most Chinese schools still lack advisers and teachers receive little training in spotting symptoms of emotional distress, Jin said. Parents are little help, often piling on pressure while ignoring their children's emotional development, he said. \\"It's a basic unwillingness or inability to recognize and deal with with emotional problems,\\" Jin said. Wang Yufeng, of Peking University's Institute of Mental, estimates the rate of emotional disorders such as depression among Chinese students under age 17 at up to 32...

He was one of the most successful road cyclists of the 1980s, and one of the finest classics riders of all time. From turning professional in 1977 until his retirement in 1994, he won nine monument classics, and 193 professional races in total. He won Paris- Context: Kelly's first professional race was the Etoile de Besseges. It started on 7 February 1977 and lasted six days. Kelly came 10th on the first day. The Flandria team was in two parts: the strongest riders, such as the world champion Freddy Maertens, were in the main section, based in Belgium. Kelly rode with the second section, based more in France because Flandria wanted to sell more of its mopeds, scooters and bicycles there. The strongest riders in both camps came together for big races. Kelly was recruited as a domestique for Maertens in the main team for year's Paris-Nice - shortly afterwards he won his first race, the opening stage of the Tour of Romandy - and stayed in it for the Tour de France, in which he also won a stage. Kelly stayed with de Gribaldy for 1977 and 1978. Then in 1978 Michel Pollentier was disqualified from the Tour de France after cheating a drugs test on the afternoon that he took the race lead. He left the team at the end of the season and started his own, with a new backer, Splendor. Both Maertens and Pollentier wanted Kelly. Pollentier and Splendor offered Kelly more and made him a team leader. But Splendor was new and logistic problems became obvious. The bikes were in poor state - enough that Splendor decided not to ride Paris-Roubaix - and the manager, Robert Lauwers, was replaced. Kelly rose above it and rode for himself. The writer Robin Magowan said: Some people can do business on the committee system; others find that life is only fun when you are running the show. In Kelly's case it was to mean working for the collection of underpaid has-beens that de Gribaldy habitually assembled. But a smaller, less pretentious team can have its advantages for a rider of Kelly's sort. When you don't have to compete for a team's loyalty you can concentrate on winning races, and that's exactly what Kelly proceeded to do. In time the team improved. Kelly received few offers from elsewhere and Splendor matched those he did get. He was paid about PS30,000 plus bonuses in his last season. But strengthening the team had included bringing in another sprinter, Eddy Planckaert, and Kelly's role as a foreigner in the team was unclear. He heard that de Gribaldy was starting a new team and the two were reunited in 1982 at Sem-France Loire. Question: How did he cheat on his drug test? Answer:","output":"Michel Pollentier, a Belgian professional cyclist, was disqualified from the 1978 Tour de France after cheating on a drug test. Pollentier attempted to submit a clean urine sample, which was not his own, by using a sophisticated system involving a rubber tube and a bulb concealed in his armpit. When Pollentier was taking the drug test after winning the Alpe d'Huez stage and taking the overall lead in the race, a suspicious race official noticed him fumbling with his jersey, leading to the exposure of his cheating attempt. As he was caught trying to tamper with his doping control, Pollentier was disqualified from the race and left the team at the end of the season. This incident was a well-known and controversial episode in professional cycling history and served as a reminder of the lengths some athletes would go to in order to avoid being caught for doping."},{"instruction":"Burr appeared in more than 50 feature films between 1946 and 1957, creating an array of villains that established him as an icon of film noir. Film historian Alain Silver concluded that Burr's most significant work in the genre is in these ten films: Desperate (1947), Sleep, My Love (1948), Raw Deal (1948), Pitfall (1948), Abandoned (1949), Red Light (1950), M (1951), His Kind of Woman (1951), The Blue Gardenia (1953) and Crime of Passion (1957). Silver described Burr's private detective in Pitfall as \\"both reprehensible and pathetic\\", a characterization also cited by film historian Richard Schickel as a prototype of film noir, in contrast with the appealing television characters for which Burr later became famous. \\"He tried to make you see the psychosis below the surface, even when the parts weren't huge,\\" said film historian James Ursini. \\"He was able to bring such complexity and different levels to those characters, and create sympathy for his characters even though they were doing reprehensible things.\\" Other titles in Burr's film noir legacy include Walk a Crooked Mile (1948), Borderline (1950), Unmasked (1950), The Whip Hand (1951), FBI Girl (1951), Meet Danny Wilson (1952), Rear Window (1954), They Were So Young (1954), A Cry in the Night (1956) and Affair in Havana (1957). Beyond noir, Burr's villains were also seen in Westerns, period dramas, horror films and adventure films. \\"I was just a fat heavy,\\" Burr told journalist James Bawden. \\"I split the heavy parts with Bill Conrad. We were both in our twenties playing much older men. I never got the girl but I once got the gorilla in a 3-D picture called Gorilla at Large. I menaced Claudette Colbert, Lizabeth Scott, Paulette Goddard, Anne Baxter, Barbara Stanwyck. Those girls would take one look at me and scream and can you blame them? I was drowned, beaten, stabbed and all for my art. But I knew I was horribly overweight. I lacked any kind of self esteem. At 25 I was playing the fathers of people older than me.\\" Burr's occasional roles on the right side of the law include the aggressive prosecutor in A Place in the Sun (1951). His courtroom performance in that film made an impression on Gail Patrick and her husband Cornwell Jackson, who had Burr in mind when they began casting the role of Los Angeles district attorney Hamilton Burger in the CBS-TV series Perry Mason.

The Ancient Greek prólogos included the modern meaning of prologue , but was of wider significance , more like the meaning of preface . The importance , therefore , of the prologue in Greek drama was very great ; it sometimes almost took the place of a romance , to which , or to an episode in which , the play itself succeeded . It is believed that the prologue in this form was practically the invention of Euripides , and with him , as has been said , it takes the place of an explanatory first act . This may help to modify the objection which criticism has often brought against the Greek prologue , as an impertinence , a useless growth prefixed to the play , and standing as a barrier between us and our enjoyment of it . The point precisely is that , to an Athenian audience , it was useful and pertinent , as supplying just what they needed to make the succeeding scenes intelligible . But it is difficult to accept the view that Euripides invented the plan of producing a god out of a machine to justify the action of deity upon man , because it is plain that he himself disliked this interference of the supernatural and did not believe in it . He seems , in such a typical prologue as that to the Hippolytus , to be accepting a conventional formula , and employing it , almost perversely , as a medium for his ironic rationalismo . - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - A preface or proem is an introduction to a book or other literary work written by the work's author. An introductory essay written by a different person is a \\"foreword\\" and precedes an author's preface. The preface often closes with acknowledgments of those who assisted in the literary work. - A foreword is a (usually short) piece of writing sometimes placed at the beginning of a book or other piece of literature. Typically written by someone other than the primary author of the work, it often tells of some interaction between the writer of the foreword and the book's primary author or the story the book tells. Later editions of a book sometimes have a new foreword prepended (appearing before an older foreword if there was one), which might explain in what respects that edition differs from previous ones.

The British settlers who had remained also resented Spanish rule, leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for ninety days of the so-called Free and Independent Republic of West Florida on September 23. After meetings beginning in June, rebels overcame the Spanish garrison at Baton Rouge (now in Louisiana), and unfurled the flag of the new republic: a single white star on a blue field. This flag would later become known as the \\"Bonnie Blue Flag\\". Now answer this question: What is known as the Bonnie Blue Flag","output":"The Bonnie Blue Flag is a historical banner that consists of a single white, five-pointed star on a blue field. The name \\"Bonnie Blue Flag\\" comes from the Scottish word \\"bonnie,\\" which means beautiful or lovely. This flag is most famously associated with the short-lived Free and Independent Republic of West Florida, which existed for ninety days in 1810, after a rebellion against Spanish rule. The rebellion started on September 23, 1810, when British settlers who remained in the region, along with American settlers, overcame the Spanish garrison at Baton Rouge (currently in Louisiana). They declared their independence and formed the Free and Independent Republic of West Florida, which was an insurgency against Spanish authority. This newly established republic adopted the single white star on a blue field as its flag. The Bonnie Blue Flag represents the desire for freedom and independence during that time. The flag would later gain even more historical significance when it was adopted as an unofficial banner of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. It became a symbol of secession and southern autonomy for those who supported the Confederate cause. In conclusion, the Bonnie Blue Flag is an emblem with a rich history, originating from the short-lived Republic of West Florida. It symbolizes the struggle for freedom and independence during the early 19th century and has become a significant part of American history due to its associations with the Confederate States of America during the Civil War."},{"instruction":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Question 2: How do I control my eating to lose weight? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"No, sweetie, the answers to these two questions are different, but they are related to each other. For your first question about the best ways to lose weight, think about it like playing in the park. You have the most fun when you run around, right? Well, it's the same with your body. When you move more often, for example by playing sports, dancing, walking, or riding your bike, your body has fun and uses up some of the food you've eaten. That can help you lose weight. You also have to eat the right kind of food, just like how at a picnic, it's better to eat lots of fruits, veggies, and lean proteins like turkey or chicken, instead of eating all the chips and cookies right away. These foods are good for your body and will help you feel full without eating too much. Now, your second question about how to control eating to lose weight is a bit different. Imagine you're playing a game where you have to collect only certain toys, otherwise the game will be over. It's the same with food. Eating lots of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is like getting the right toys, and avoiding too much sugary, fatty, or junk food is like ignoring the wrong toys. Eating smaller portions, like having just one cookie instead of a whole box, also helps keep the game going for longer. And don't forget to drink lots of water like when you're thirsty after playing! This helps keep your body happy and can also help with eating less. So the two answers are different, but both are important for losing weight."},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - PNC Park is a baseball park located on the North Shore of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

He was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for 30 years. Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, scientific methodology, and semiotics, and for his founding of pragmatism. An innovator in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, research methodology, and various sciences, Peirce considered himself, first and foremost, a logician. In 1879, Peirce was appointed Lecturer in logic at Johns Hopkins University, which had strong departments in a number of areas that interested him, such as philosophy (Royce and Dewey completed their PhDs at Hopkins), psychology (taught by G. Stanley Hall and studied by Joseph Jastrow, who coauthored a landmark empirical study with Peirce), and mathematics (taught by J. J. Sylvester, who came to admire Peirce's work on mathematics and logic). His Studies in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins University (1883) contained works by himself and Allan Marquand, Christine Ladd, Benjamin Ives Gilman, and Oscar Howard Mitchell, several of whom were his graduate students. Peirce's nontenured position at Hopkins was the only academic appointment he ever held. Brent documents something Peirce never suspected, namely that his efforts to obtain academic employment, grants, and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major Canadian-American scientist of the day, Simon Newcomb. Peirce's efforts may also have been hampered by what Brent characterizes as his difficult personality. Conversely, Keith Devlin believes that Peirce's work was too far ahead of his time to be appreciated by the academic establishment of the day and that this played a large role in his inability to obtain a tenured position. Peirce's personal life undoubtedly worked against his professional success. After his first wife, Harriet Melusina Fay (\\"Zina\\"), left him in 1875, Peirce, while still legally married, became involved with Juliette, whose last name, given variously as Froissy and Pourtalai, and nationality (she spoke French) remains uncertain. When his divorce from Zina became final in 1883, he married Juliette. That year, Newcomb pointed out to a Johns Hopkins trustee that Peirce, while a Hopkins employee, had lived and traveled with a woman to whom he was not married; the ensuing scandal led to his dismissal in January 1884. Over the years Peirce sought academic employment at various universities without success. He had no children by either marriage.

Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B? Hint: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Answer:","output":"Sample A would produce ATP molecules. In sample A, the respiration rate is increased, leading to an increase in cellular respiration, which is the process of converting glucose and oxygen into usable energy in the form of ATP molecules. Sample B, with no respiration rate, would not produce ATP molecules through cellular respiration."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to remove all words of a given length in the sentence.

He finds that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with lots of money for a law suit. In comes Alison Deedy (playing Elizabeth) whose father is in Africa and being held by an African tribe for ransom of the map Elizabeth's father had sent her. Elizabeth seeks out Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father.There is a good cast of supporting characters that go along with Quatermain and Elizabeth and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who want the map also.The movie holds your attention until the end. Patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome honorable man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, the rugged silent good man, anger and strength; In King Solomon's Minds his character actually smiles a few times. I would really like to see Patrick Swayze in a relaxed live-loving story again, one in which he doesn't have to clench his jaws and be quite so strong. Maybe a little dancing would help.

'All I hear is my daughter, crying': a Salvadoran father's plight after separation at border Read more On Saturday, Sanders posted: “Last night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington [Virginia] to leave because I work for POTUS and I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so.” Walter Shaub, federal ethics chief under Barack Obama and briefly Donald Trump and now a fierce critic of the administration, responded: “Sanders used her official govt account to condemn a private business for personal reasons … she can lob attacks on her own time but not using her official position.” The controversy came at the end of a week of fierce debate over a Trump policy which mandated the separation of children from their parents when such families entered the US illegally. Between April and early June, according to federal statistics, more than 2,300 children were taken. On Wednesday, amid international condemnation and with even Republican supporters in Congress beginning to waver, Trump signed an executive order nominally – but not conclusively – stopping the practice. On Saturday, groups of Democrats visited federal facilities, seeking details about how the children will be reunited with their families. The Department of Homeland Security said it knew where all the children were and was working to reunite them. On Sunday, Trump returned to the attack on Twitter, advocating the end of due process. “We cannot allow all of these people to invade our ountry,” the president wrote. “When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order.” Amid the controversy over immigration, and mixed messages from the president about congressional efforts at reform, there has been no White House press briefing since Monday. Then, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, addressed reporters on the separations policy. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Red Hen restaurant in downtown Lexington, Virginia. Photograph: Daniel Lin/AP Nielsen and the policy adviser Stephen Miller both found themselves confronted by protesters in Mexican restaurants in Washington. The Red Hen seats 26 and serves “inspired Shenandoah cuisine” a three-hour drive from DC. Its owner told the Washington Post Sanders was served with a selection of cheeses before she decided, following a consultation with staff members, to ask her to leave the premises. From El Salvador to the US: handcuffed at the border, separated for months Read more “I was babbling a little,” Stephanie Wilkinson said, “but I got my point across in a polite and direct fashion. I explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty and compassion and cooperation. I said, �?I’d like to ask you to leave.’” Sanders, Wilkinson said, replied: “That’s fine. I’ll go.” Others at her table followed. Wilkinson said: “They offered to pay. I said, �?No. It’s on the house.’” The owner added: “I would have done the same thing again. We just felt there are moments in time when people need to live their convictions. This appeared to be one.” The story set off a Twitter battle between Trump supporters and opponents, many on both sides comparing it to a recent supreme court ruling that said the owner of a Colorado cake shop was right to refuse service to a gay couple, based on his religious beliefs. Sanders’ father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, waded in, writing: “Bigotry. On the menu at Red Hen Restaurant in Lexington VA. Or you can ask for the �?Hate Plate’. And appetizers are �?small plates for small minds’.” Newt Gingrich, a former Republican House speaker who many blame for US politics’ descent into vitriol and schism in the 1990s, wrote: “The increasing personal nastiness toward people who work for President Trump reflects the left’s understanding that they are losing. Nastiness reflects desperation, not strength. They can’t win the argument so they use nastiness. Sad and dangerous.” Shaub launched a series of tweets of his own. “Sarah,” he began. “I know you don’t care even a tiny little bit about the ethics rules, but using your official account for this is a clear violation … It’s the same as if [a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] agent pulled out his badge when a restaurant tried to throw him/her out. Slaves knew 'the fearful anguish of broken hearts'. In Trump's America, migrants do too | Daina Ramey Berry Read more “Sanders used her official gov[ernmen]t account to condemn a private business for personal reasons. Seeks to coerce business by using her office to get public to pressure it. Violates endorsements ban too.” The Red Hen found itself at the centre of online efforts to boost or damage its customer reviews, hoax booking calls and differing opinions locally. Amid a media scrum, Tom Lomax, a local business owner, brought flowers as a show of support. He called Wilkinson a “force of nature” and “one of the biggest drivers of the downtown” and told the Associated Press: “We support our own here, great little community we have.” Stephen Russek, a former restaurant owner, said: “You have your political opinions, you don’t throw somebody out of your restaurant. They ought to be shut down.” Shaub added: “There’s no ethics rule against Sarah Sanders fans being cartoonish hypocrites in defending merchants discriminating against gay people but howling when a merchant rejects a human rights violator based on her involvement in harming babies & children. Ridicule will have to suffice.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was asked to leave the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, due to her work for President Trump.

He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The painting was referred to in the earliest inventories as La Familia (\\"The Family\\"). A detailed description of Las Meninas, which provides the identification of several of the figures, was published by Antonio Palomino (\\"the Giorgio Vasari of the Spanish Golden Age\\") in 1724. Examination under infrared light reveals minor pentimenti, that is, there are traces of earlier working that the artist himself later altered. For example, at first Velázquez's own head inclined to his right rather than his left.The painting has been cut down on both the left and right sides. It was damaged in the fire that destroyed the Alcázar in 1734, and was restored by court painter Juan García de Miranda (1677–1749). The left cheek of the Infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, The Family of Philip IV, which was repeated in the records of 1814. The painting entered the collection of the Museo del Prado on its foundation in 1819. In 1843, the Prado catalogue listed the work for the first time as Las Meninas.In recent years, the picture has suffered a loss of texture and hue. Due to exposure to pollution and crowds of visitors, the once-vivid contrasts between blue and white pigments in the costumes of the meninas have faded. It was last cleaned in 1984 under the supervision of the American conservator John Brealey, to remove a \\"yellow veil\\" of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century.

Would \\"Grits are similar to other thick maize-based porridges from around the world such as polenta or the thinner farina .\\" be a reasonable answer? (1). No (2). Yes The answer is:","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Grits are similar to other thick maize-based porridges from around the world such as polenta or the thinner farina\\" can be considered a reasonable answer. However, it can benefit from a more in-depth explanation. Grits are made from ground corn, specifically from a type of corn called dent corn. This corn variety is characterized by its hard, starchy texture, which is ideal for grinding into small particles. The process of making grits involves cleaning, hulling, and milling the corn, resulting in coarse granules that are then cooked in water or milk to create a thick, creamy porridge. Although grits are similar in concept to other maize-based porridges like polenta and farina, there are several differences that distinguish them from one another. Polenta, originating from Italy, is made from a different type of corn, called flint corn. It has a finer texture and often has a distinct yellow hue. The cooking process and final consistency of polenta are almost similar to that of grits; however, polenta is usually more finely ground and may be served with a variety of Italian-inspired accompaniments. Farina, on the other hand, is made from wheat rather than corn. It is a finely ground grain, which is milled to remove the outer bran layer and produce a smooth, fine flour. Farina is then cooked in water to create a thinner, mildly-flavored porridge that is often consumed as a breakfast dish. The texture and thickness of farina contrast with the coarser grits and highlight one significant difference between the two. While all three of these dishes are made from grains and served as porridges, their individual characteristics, such as the type of grain used, the milling process, and their final consistency, set them apart from one another. These distinctions give each dish unique flavors, textures, and culinary applications."},{"instruction":"Instructions: Generate a question which can yield the answer mentioned in the input.

In the Lancet 2010 study, it was suggested that aspirin, aside from its known protection against strokes and heart attacks, appeared to also notably reduce the risk of many types of cancer development. Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, is a medication used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Aspirin inhibits the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that release messengers promoting inflammation and pain after injury or infection. The drug is also an antiplatelet medicine, which prevents blood clots from forming. Because aspirin makes the blood less sticky, it can also reduce the chance of heart attacks and stroke - conditions often caused by blood clots. The Lancet 2010 study observed the anticancer properties of aspirin. Several types of cancer appear to be less common in people who take aspirin, including colorectal, esophageal, breast, and prostate cancer. The study's analysis suggested that daily aspirin intake could also improve cancer survival rates. These anti-cancer properties might result from the anti-inflammatory effect of aspirin, given that chronic inflammation can cause DNA damage, which can lead to cancer. Also, aspirin's ability to inhibit platelets might deter cancer cells from spreading. However, the context of aspirin being used as a 'miracle drug' to prevent cancer, heart attacks, and strokes should be approached with caution. Aspirin does have side effects, especially when used over a long period. These can include gastrointestinal ulcers and stomach bleeding, among other things. Therefore, decisions on long-term aspirin use should be made on individual needs and risk profiles, ideally in consultation with a healthcare professional. Despite aspirin's potential benefits, it's not suitable for everyone and is not a definitive solution or cure-all. It is essential to consider every treatment within the broader context of a healthy lifestyle, including balanced diet, regular exercise, and routine health checks. It is paramount to recognize the importance of studies underscoring aspirin's benefits, but these should be weighed against other factors when considering preventative health strategies."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In four elegant brothels, called \\"Flower Houses\\", in fin-de-siÃ¨cle 19th-century Shanghai (Qing dynasty), several affairs are described. Events presumably take place in 1884, a year named in one of the scenes. The action involves four men who live for pleasure, and takes place mostly in the light of oil lamps, giving the film a claustrophobic feel. Preparation and consumption of opium and tea occur more than once, and dishes of food are served and hot towels prepared in several scenes. We are introduced to the main characters, mainly the courtesans known as Crimson, Pearl, Emerald, Jasmine and Jade. Crimson belongs to Huifang Enclave (èè³é) brothel; Pearl and Jade to Gongyang Enclave (å¬é½é) brothel; Emerald lives at Shangren Enclave (å°ä»é) brothel; and Jasmine works at East Hexing Enclave (æ±åèé) brothel. The relationship between the wealthy patrons and the courtesans are semi-monogamous, frequently lasting many years. The courtesans are purchased at an early age by the owners of the brothels, otherwise known as \\"Aunties\\". In spite of the trappings of luxury and the wealth surrounding them, the graceful, well-bred courtesans live lives of slavery. Although there are only a few references to the courtesans being beaten, we are led to understand that there are frequent beatings for the girls and women with harsher Aunties and that beatings for perceived misbehaviour are common. Because of the oppressing social conventions, the best that the courtesans, known as \\"flower girls\\", can hope for is to pay off their debts some day (possible through a wealthy patron) or marry into a better social status. The silent Master Wang leaves the courtesan Crimson in favor of Jasmine, with whom he fell madly in love in only 10 days, after (allegedly) 2Â½ years with Crimson.

The statement talks about when Yitzhak Rabin became Prime Minister, but the question asks about the date of his assassination. Yitzhak Rabin, the fifth Prime Minister of Israel, was assassinated on November 4, 1995. Rabin played a significant role in Israeli politics and was instrumental in promoting peace negotiations in the region. He served two non-consecutive terms as Prime Minister, first from 1974 to 1977, and then from 1992 until his assassination in 1995. Rabin's second term as Prime Minister was marked by his efforts to reach a peace agreement with Israel's neighbors, particularly the Palestinians. In 1993, he played a pivotal role in negotiating the Oslo Accords with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a historic agreement that aimed to establish a framework for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Along with Shimon Peres, Israel's Foreign Minister, and Yasser Arafat, the Chairman of the PLO, Rabin was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 for their work on the Oslo Accords. Despite these efforts towards peace, Rabin faced significant opposition from right-wing Israelis who believed his policies threatened Israel's security. His assassin, Yigal Amir, was a Jewish law student who was against the peace process and perceived Rabin as a traitor. Amir fatally shot Rabin as he was leaving a peace rally in Tel Aviv on November 4, 1995. The assassination of Yitzhak Rabin shook the political landscape in Israel and the Middle East. The tragic event highlighted the deep divisions within Israeli society and underscored the ongoing challenges in achieving a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Although Rabin's work towards peace was cut short by his untimely death, his legacy continues to inspire those who support a peaceful resolution to the longstanding conflict in the region."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Cameron filled their face with Botox and it turns out the procedure went haywire.

Peter Campbell and Martin Robinson. PUBLISHED:. 13:43 EST, 20 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 14:31 EST, 21 November 2012. The UK's most revered technology entrepreneur, known as 'Britain's Bill Gates', has denied masterminding a £3billion accounting cover-up as a bitter row with his former bosses at Hewlett Packard intensified today. Dr Mike Lynch made more than £500million by selling his home-grown software firm Autonomy last year in a £7.1billion deal but now the American company has wiped £5.5billion (8.8bn) off its value. HP boss Meg Whitman blames ‘accounting improprieties’ by 'certain former Autonomy employees' for the £3billion loss, accusing Lynch and others of 'lying' to them by inflating revenues and profit margins for at least two years before the deal was struck. But Dr Lynch denies the claims and says that the 300 auditors HP had poring over their books would have picked up any problems. Tonight he ruled out legal action against those making the claims and pointed the finger at HP. Row: British technology guru Dr Mike Lynch (left) denies his company orchestrated a £3bn accounting cover-up when he sold his Autonomy company to Meg Whitman's (right) Hewlett Packard last year. Appearing on Sky News, he told Jeff Randall: 'HP was once a great company. If that business can get back to its core and fix itself then I think Autonomy will have a good future. HP needs to stop trying to deflect attention away from itself.' After the write-off, HP's shares dropped to 11 yesterday - down 12 per cent - the lowest level for HP in a decade. Dr Lynch, 47, who is a non-executive director of the BBC and adviser to David Cameron, could now face a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and today said he was furious about the claims levelled at him and rejected them all. He lives in a £6millon Grade II-listed Georgian manor house in Suffolk, with eight bedrooms and five bathrooms, and sits in 70 acres of grounds with private woodland, paddocks, a swimming pool, four cottages and a lodge. Home: Mike Lynch owns the £6million Grade II listed Loudham Hall in Suffolk. Luxurious: The handsome house has eight bedrooms and five bathrooms. Grand: The mansion has 70 acres of grounds with private woodland, paddocks, a swimming pool, four cottages and a lodge. 'The figures are just mad. Things would have to have gone pretty badly wrong to justify writing 8.8bn,' Dr Lynch said in his rebuttal. 'It. is utterly untrue. We reject this as utterly untrue. Everything we did. we gave correctly to the auditors and was correctly noted by the. auditors. 'I don't. understand how you can write-down this amount and say somehow this was. all caused by something you didn't notice when you did due diligence. with 300 people. It would have been kind of a big elephant to miss.' According to HP, evidence of an accounting cover-up was. apparently revealed to them by a former Autonomy executive whistleblower within the last. six months. It has already been passed to financial prosecutors on both. sides of the Atlantic. Lynch has 'flatly rejected' the accusations and said he was 'shocked' but confident he would be absolved of any misdeeds. He left HP after Autonomy missed budget forecasts and says that Autonomy has been mismanaged since his exit. Tech giant: Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto in California, has taken a £5.5billion hit after accusing staff at Autonomy - a British company it purchased last year - of cooking the books to increase its company value. Dr Lynch is on the BBC's executive board and said today that it had spoken to him and would not ask him to resign as a non executive director. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'The BBC has spoken to Dr Mike Lynch regarding the allegations made against his company in the media. We note that the company has denied the allegations. 'We have not asked Dr Lynch to step down from his role as a BBC Non-Executive Director. We will continue to monitor the situation as it develops and will take any further action should it become necessary.' HP also said it would also. ‘aggressively pursue’ individual Autonomy executives to recoup financial. damages for its shareholders. The allegations come six months after. Dr Lynch walked away from the business he founded after he fell out with. management, insiders say. New Yorker Meg Whitman is arguably. America's most successful businesswoman with a CV littered with jobs. at some of the world's biggest companies. The. mother-of-two is the fourth wealthiest woman in California with a net. worth of 1.3billion, mainly built up while serving as eBay’s chief executive. from 1998 to 2008. In that. time she started with 30 employees and boosted it to 15,000 staff. within a decade, drawing in an incredible 8bn in annual revenues. Previously. she had worked at giants like Walt Disney, DreamWorks, Procter &. Gamble and Hasbro before joining Hewlett Packard on an annual salary of. 1 - but also around 16million of stock options and other perks. including a company plane. She. also attempted a political career and in 2010 shattered the record for. the biggest spending candidate in any U.S. election in history. She. splashed out a staggering 119 million of her own money in her failed. bid to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger as California’s next Republican. governor. By shelling out. another 15 million from her hi-tech fortune , she surpassed the 109. million spent by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg on his 2009. re-election campaign. Her track-record in business is hallmarked with her reputation for her determination in driving companies to success. When he started a. software company in his garage in 1996, Mike Lynch could not have dreamt. he would one day sell it for more than £7billion. Those who knew. him well say that Lynch is intelligent driven, and ambitious, and. predicted the sale of Autonomy, which netted him just over half a. billion pounds, would not be the last that we would hear of Dr Lynch. Little. were they to know that he would reappear as he did yesterday, with the. allegations levelled by Hewlett Packard throwing him back into the. spotlight. After he was born in County Tipperary in Ireland in. 1965 to a fireman and a nurse, Lynch’s family moved to Chelmsford, Essex. while he was still a child. There Mike showed early signs of his fierce intelligence, and won a scholarship to the nearby private school Bancroft’s. He. went on to study physics, maths and biochemistry at Christ’s College,. Cambridge, before opting to spend the next years of his life in. academia. It was the miracle growth of Autonomy that earned him the title ‘Britain’s Bill Gates’. He was given an OBE in 1996 and a year later was appointed to the BBC executive committee as a non-executive director. He. lives in a Grade II listed Georgian manor house in Suffolk, although it. is not known whether he has a family at the massive home.The £6m estate has 70 acres of grounds and is surrounded by private woodland. Autonomy rose from humble beginnings. in 1996 to become a darling of the City and a member of the FTSE 100. index of the UK’s biggest companies. It was seen as a great success story. of British innovation, providing computer programs that processed large. amounts of data to thousands of small businesses. Software giant Oracle says it had the chance to buy Autonomy but decided it was incredibly over-priced, its founder Larry Ellison has said. The world's sixth richest man said Mike Lynch approached him with a deal but he balked at the proposed 6bn value. 'We looked at the price and thought it was absurdly high,' he said a month after HP did the deal. It then turned into a war of words between him and Dr Lynch, who said: 'If some bank happened to come with us on a list, that is nothing to do with us.” But Oracle then declared it was 'another whopper from Autonomy CEO Mike Lynch.' The statement went on: 'Either Lynch has a very poor memory or he’s lying. 'Some bank did not just happen to come to Oracle with Autonomy \\"on a list.\\" The truth is that Mr. Lynch came to Oracle, along with his investment banker.' To further embarrass Lynch, Oracle then released a slides detailing Autonomy’s financial health they had received. Ten years after founding the firm,. Irish-born and Cambridge-educated Dr Lynch was awarded an OBE. HP’s chief executive Meg Whitman, was not in charge when it bought Autonomy. Former HP boss Leo Apotheker led the acquisition of Autonomy and in his two years in charge the company's share valuedropped by 45 per cent, with a big dip when they completed the deal. She issued a strongly worded. statement about the affair. She alleged that ‘some former members. of Autonomy’s management team used accounting improprieties,. misrepresentations and disclosure failures to inflate the underlying. financial metrics of the company, prior to Autonomy’s acquisition by. HP’. She added: ‘These efforts appear to. have been a wilful effort to mislead investors and potential buyers, and. severely impacted HP management’s ability to fairly value Autonomy at. the time of the deal.’ Miss Whitman has passed details of the. financial cover-ups to the UK’s Serious Fraud Office and its US. equivalent, the Securities and Exchanges Commission, ‘for civil and. criminal investigation’. Although she refused to name the. executives who were likely to be questioned, she said ‘a senior member. of Autonomy’s leadership team came forward [with the details] following. the departure of Mike Lynch’. It is thought to be unlikely that any financial cover-up would occur without the knowledge of Dr Lynch. A PR company acting for Dr Lynch. yesterday issued a statement saying he was ‘shocked to see this. statement today, and flatly rejects these allegations, which are false’. It added: ‘HP’s senior management has also been closely involved with running Autonomy for the past year. ‘It took ten years to build Autonomy’s. industry-leading technology and it is sad to see how it has been. mismanaged since its acquisition by HP.’ The SFO refused to comment on whether it would launch an investigation.

The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. \\"Traditional folk music\\" has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - The V Shows is a live album/DVD recorded at the London Astoria by rock band Mostly Autumn. It was recorded on the tour supporting their 2003 release \\"Passengers\\". The DVD for this show was also included in their 2005 DVD release \\"Pink Floyd Revisited\\". Also, this is the first Mostly Autumn release to feature drummer Andrew Jennings. - Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - Psychedelic music (sometimes psychedelia) covers a range of popular music styles and genres influenced by the 1960s psychedelic culture, a subculture of people who used psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline and DMT to experience visual and auditory hallucinations, synesthesia and altered states of consciousness. Psychedelic music attempted to replicate the hallucinogenic experience of using these drugs or enhance the experience of using them. Psychedelic music emerged during the mid-1960s among folk rock and blues rock bands in the United States and Britain. - The London Astoria was a music venue, located at 157 Charing Cross Road, in London, England. It had been leased and run by Festival Republic since 2000. It was closed on 15 January 2009 and has since been demolished. The venue is still seen today as an iconic music establishment, as it helped to launch the careers of many British rock bands and also played a part in the UK success of many international acts. It was also a famous venue in Britain's LGBT scene, for holding London's biggest gay new year parties along with G-A-Y. - Mostly Autumn are an English rock band. The group formed in 1995 and have built their reputation through constant touring, never signing to a major label. They produce music heavily influenced by 1970s progressive rock. According to the BBC, Mostly Autumn \\"fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd with Celtic themes, hard rock and strong, emotional melodies\\". They have also been compared with other progressive bands such as Jethro Tull and Camel, blended with traditional folk music. Later albums also include more contemporary influences. - Pink Floyd Revisited is a live DVD recorded by rock band Mostly Autumn in 2004 .

But beyond the handshakes, casual strolls and shared asides, many analysts and experts are already wondering what exactly the enduring substance of the summit will be and whether it could boost Trump's political rating at home. For Trump, the great political disrupter, it was the most significant foreign policy move of his presidency. It comes at a time when he looks to turn around his often weak polls and bolster his political standing at home in advance of midterm congressional elections in November, where Democrats are poised to make gains. From the images of their historic first handshake to signing an agreement on denuclearization, Trump and Kim took the first steps toward writing a new chapter in relations between their two countries. \\"People are going to be very impressed, people are going to be very happy, and we are going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world,\\" Trump said sitting alongside Kim after both men signed the joint agreement. It was Trump's biggest moment on the world stage, and an opportunity he was eager to seize. \\"We got along really well.We had a great chemistry.You understand how I feel about chemistry.It is very important,\\" Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren immediately after the summit. \\"I mean, I know people where there is no chemistry. We had it right from the beginning.

The two men signed an agreement that committed both countries to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but the details remain vague. The United States offered unspecified security guarantees and a halt to military exercises with South Korea. Trump also said he raised the issue of human rights with Kim, but added that most of the meeting focused on the nuclear issue.

More than 60 schools due to house polling stations have been hit by arson attacks in the last 36 hours. The violence came as the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) – which is boycotting the vote – began a two-day strike in protest at what it called a \\"scandalous farce\\". Its ally, the country's biggest Islamist organisation, has been effectively banned from participating in the election. There will be no voting in nearly half the 300 seats of the national parliament which have already been won by the ruling Awami League party. The Awami League is expected to win almost all those being contested, though a handful of rebels from the party could cause some upsets. Tariq Zia, the son of the BNP's leader, Khaleda Zia, called on Saturday for the opposition's four-month-old protest campaign to be intensified in the final runup to the poll in the poor and unstable country of 150 million people. \\"A political faction has distorted the idea of Bangladesh we have had until now for its own interests. I call on all of you to utilise all your strength and come out on the street,\\" Tariq Zia said in a videoed message. Many of the senior officials of the BNP have been imprisoned on charges of fomenting violence and hundreds of lower level workers have been temporarily detained. Khaled Zia herself has been held under effective house arrest in her Dhaka residence. The BNP decided to boycott the election when the government refused to hand over power to a neutral administration. However, senior Awami League officials accuse the BNP of refusing a series of compromise offers, including ministerial posts, and say the restrictions and detentions are necessary to \\"prevent arson killing, burning and destruction of private property\\". Gowher Rizvi, a key adviser to the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, said that postponing the election was not an option. \\"Even if the BNP boycott has taken some of the lustre off the election the government had no choice but to go forward. Not to have had an election would have created a legal and constitutional vacuum. There would have been a state without a government,\\" he said. There has been only one peaceful transfer of power between the parties since the restoration of democracy in Bangladesh in 1991. Each recent poll has been marked by unrest but recent months have been especially violent. Overall, more than 500 people have been killed and at least 20,000 injured in protests, clashes, arson and other attacks in the last year. Awami League officials admit that the new parliament to be elected on Sunday can at best be considered \\"transitional\\" and that new polls will have to be held to seek a convincing mandate. The European Union, a major market for Bangladesh's massive garment industry, has refused to send election observers, as have the US and the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 mainly former British colonies. Some fear that the EU may now suspend trade privileges which aid the garment producers in Bangladesh. Government officials said such a move would be \\"counterproductive\\" and lead to massive job losses. Many voters are angry with both parties as well as worried about violence. The opposition will hail low levels of participation in the poll as a partial victory. However, patchy enforcement of the strike and blockade indicate that there is little support for the BNP-led protest movement either. Analysts have variously described the violence as \\"a tussle between liberal and pro-democratic elements and non-democratic, anti-secular ones\\"\\"a tussle between liberal and pro-democratic elements and non-democratic, anti-secular ones\\", an intensification of the contest between factions within the country's elite that has been going since Bangladesh won its independence from Pakistan in a brutal civil war in 1971, or the result of a personal feud between Zia, 68, and Hasina, 66.","output":"Title: \\"Bangladesh Polling Stations Sabotaged in Arson Attacks Amid Election Unrest and Violence\\""},{"instruction":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: The \\"ground\\" is a concept that we encounter in numerous areas of our daily life, whether we are discussing the physical surface of the Earth or using it as a reference point in various science and humanities disciplines. For instance, in physics, the ground usually serves as a baseline for measuring potential energy, where the potential energy of an object is lowest when placed on the ground. Moreover, the term “ground level” refers to our everyday living environment on which we navigate and build our infrastructure. In relation to the study of electricity, the ground is essential for understanding how electrical circuits function. It serves as both a common reference point for voltage measurements and a safety measure that helps to prevent electrical shock or electrical fires. In the case of an electrical fault, grounding ensures that current flows safely into the Earth rather than traveling through our bodies or other conductive materials. In residential electrical wiring, a grounding wire is typically connected from outlets and other equipment to the ground, allowing excess electricity to be discharged harmlessly. In the context of gardening, the ground refers to the soil that supports plant growth, providing plants with essential nutrients, water, and an anchor for their roots. Gardeners often pay special attention to the quality of the ground, ensuring that it has the right balance of nutrients, proper pH, and good drainage to support a thriving ecosystem of plant life. Amending and maintaining the quality of the ground – through composting, tilling, or using fertilizers – is a crucial practice for successful gardening. The ground is also critical in the context of construction and architecture. When planning and constructing a new building, the ground serves as the foundation on which structures are built. A well-prepared and stable ground is crucial to the long-term stability of any structure, be it a house or a skyscraper. Assessing the ground's soil type and load-bearing capacity helps architects and engineers design and build secure foundations that can support the weight of the construction. In summary, the ground refers to the surface of the Earth and serves as an essential reference point, safety measure, and foundation in various disciplines, ranging from physics and electricity to gardening and architecture."},{"instruction":"Premise: Outside town, on the main Valencia highway, the Monasterio de Santa Verenica (Saint Veronica's Monastery) attracts about 15,000 pilgrims and a good many hawkers during the annual May celebration of the Santa Faz (Holy Face).

Perhaps he will persuade a skeptical public, but it is surely the toughest speaking assignment of his presidency. Surprisingly, he is now tripling down on his Syrian bet. First he drew the red line, uncertain whether President Bashar al-Assad would call his bluff. Then he doubled down by insisting on a vote from an unreliable Congress. Now he is placing almost all his chips on the table by betting on his capacity to turn around public opinion. If he wins over the public, he will likely win Congress, too, but if he fails, he will have turned a problem in Syria into a crisis in his presidency. (Someday, in their memoirs, will White House insiders please tell us what they were thinking?) There are at least two major hurdles in his path as he seeks to persuade the public. First, he will be trying to change opinion that has already started to harden against him. Second, the bully pulpit may not be as powerful as often imagined. The intensity factor. It's hard to remember a public terrain as rough as this one for a president in the past few decades. Weary of war and wary of another, Americans are in no mood to rally behind this call to arms -- many don't see it as our fight, they worry that it will drag us in deeper and even some of his most ardent supporters think the president and his team don't have a firm grip on the wheel. A Gallup poll late this past week found that a majority of the public (51% to 36%) is opposed to a Syrian strike. That is the lowest level of support Gallup has found for any intervention in two decades. Moreover, the \\"intensity factor\\" runs much more strongly among opponents -- just look at the avalanche of their calls and e-mails to Capitol Hill. The president has been arguing his case for nearly three weeks, and so far, he doesn't have many converts on the Hill. That's among Democrats as well as Republicans. CNN's whip count suggests that he could win a tight vote in the Senate (his speech may work best there), but a strike resolution is in serious trouble in the House. The Washington Post count shows that as many as a third of House Democrats may vote no. Even overseas, among nations much closer to Syria, the president's rhetorical offensive has fallen short. No president in modern times has had such a tiny coalition behind him. Eighteen nations contributed to the intervention in Libya. President George W. Bush had 48 nations in the coalition that attacked Saddam Hussein. This time around, Obama will have only a handful supporting his intervention and most will be cheering from the sidelines. A shaky pulpit. This controversy is also coming at an inopportune moment for the president. Early on at the White House, he could command massive, almost adoring audiences at every major address. But with the exception of his speech announcing the killing of Osama bin Laden, the numbers tuning in have dropped, viewers tend to be more partisan and television commentators have toughened up on him. Notably, his two Syrian interviews on television so far have drawn only modest audiences. It has been little noticed but is important now that Obama has also had more success selling himself than his policies. Obama's speeches -- despite their rhetorical strength and skilled delivery -- have had little success in moving his agenda forward. Americans still like him, but they tend to make up their own minds about his policies. Witness his inability, even now, to build a public majority in favor of Obamacare. The White House would argue that a majority have supported his stands on gun control and gay rights, but is that because of his speeches or because of demographic shifts and events such as the Newtown elementary school massacre? Indeed, there is now a debate among political scientists whether the bully pulpit is all that it is cracked up to be, especially in contemporary politics. Professor George Edwards of Texas A&M University and a dean among political scientists concluded in his 2006 book, \\"On Deaf Ears: The Limits of the Bully Pulpit,\\" that we have a highly inflated view of how much presidents have been able to change public minds through their speeches. He presents numerous cases to support his argument and one that is especially relevant today:. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a legendary ability to connect with Americans through his fireside chats, but when it came to convincing a skeptical public about his Supreme Court-packing bill in his second term, the fire fizzled out. Edwards' data also suggests that presidents only succeed in mobilizing the public when opinion is already in their favor. This is clearly not the case with Syria. To our memory, the last Oval Office address that dramatically moved the public opinion needle over military conflict came in late 1983 when President Ronald Reagan spoke to the country about a bloody attack on marine barracks in Lebanon and U.S. intervention in the tiny island of Grenada. Public support for military action jumped 10 points in immediate polling. But in that case, Reagan was telling a story about what had already happened to a public whose majority already favored intervention. He was not asking them to rally round a new, uncertain venture, and he was also still in his first term when audiences were big. This is not to argue that all is lost for Obama on Tuesday night. Big speeches can reframe issues. They can unite us behind a higher purpose. They can push us to question our firmly held beliefs. Obama does have unusually persuasive powers. Perhaps he can come up with fresh arguments that will bring undecideds in his direction. Perhaps he will have horrific new evidence of how brutal al-Assad is. Perhaps ... perhaps, but if he has new arrows in his quiver, he likely would have shot them by now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergan and Dan Katz. Write highlights for this article.","output":"President Barack Obama faced a significant challenge as he launched his media blitz on Syria in an attempt to persuade a skeptical public in 2013. With six television interviews and a prime time address, Obama aimed to turn around public opinion and gain support from Congress. However, the task at hand was daunting due to hardened opinions against intervention in Syria, and the bully pulpit potentially being less powerful. Additionally, the public's weariness of war and concerns about the US's involvement in Syria made Obama's mission to rally support exceedingly difficult. Despite his skilled delivery and rhetorical strength, changing public minds and mobilizing support proved to be a tough job for Obama."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question.

They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths. As fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate . By looking through a microscope and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree. Ring counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements of each otolith ring. The daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring. Thorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history. In the case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles. This is important to managers in the fish industry, who know nearly nothing about the track of the young fish for most food fish in the ocean. Eager to learn about his technology, fish scientists are now lending Thorrold their ears. Question: Why does the writer compare the fish to trees? Answer: Choose your answer from: A).

When I got out of the car to take a photograph, they stood up, crossed the road and disappeared into the woods. I had come to Burträsk to learn about a secret that felt as elusive as these animals. In this Swedish village, they make a hard yellow cheese dotted with tiny holes called Västerbottensost. If you attend one of Sweden’s traditional summer crayfish parties, you’ll most likely find it served alongside succulent crustaceans and copious schnapps. It’s been on the menu at royal weddings, Nobel Prize dinners and Copenhagen super-restaurant Noma. Famed Swedish playwright August Strindberg mentioned it in his poetry, and Prince Hassan of Jordan said it’s “what I love most about Sweden”. With a reputation like this, it’s understandable that demand for the cheese is high. But when the dairy tried to expand production by starting an operation in the nearby city of Umeå, it didn’t taste the same. It turns out that for the cheese can only be made in Burträsk – and no one knows why. Not even after using forensic DNA analysis techniques or making 12 documentaries about Västerbottensost. Its been suggested that the cheese’s unique flavour could be due to the local spruce shelves that it’s left to mature on, the particular microflora in the dairy building, or even long summer days affecting the mood of the cows. According to the most intriguing theory, the beloved taste is all down to a meteorite that struck the area long ago, creating the lake next to Burträsk and making the soil rich in calcium, which in turn created knock-on effects on the milk and the cheese-making process. If that ancientrock really did land here, however, then the shock waves have long since dispersed. When I arrived, things were pretty peaceful. The dairy roof was covered in a layer of snow, and the sun glinted off the metallic lettering on the red-brick exterior. Burträsk is less than 300km from the Arctic Circle, and the locals are used to dark winters. But today spring was emerging, with wispy clouds stretched across the bright blue sky. Inside the dairy’s spacious visitor centre, light flooded in through a large window. All around the room were displays about the cheese, its history and its place in Swedish culture. I was shown around by Inga Lill-Eklund, who now works in the cafe but spent 35 years in the dairy’s laboratory, taking samples of the bacteria in the milk. Inga’s son, Thomas, is the current master cheese maker, as the head of the dairy is known. According to legend, Inga said, the cheese was created in 1872 by mistake. The story goes that a Burträsk dairymaid called Ulrika Eleonora Lindstrom was distracted from her cheese-making duties by a lover; the process was prolonged and she had to keep reheating the curds. The resulting cheese was left to age anyway, and when someone tasted it they realised the happy accident. The precise recipe is still a secret – but the logistics of making the cheese haven’t changed much over the years. The milk is delivered from 20 to 30 different local farms, pasteurised and curdled. Inga explained that the consistency of the cheese in the curdling vat is still hand tested, to judge its feel in the fingers. The granular curds that emerge after the liquid whey is drained are packed inside linen cloths into a round mould, turned several times by hand, and soaked in brine according to a strict schedule. The resulting cheeses (which weigh 18kg each) are then left to age for at least 14 months at a nearby warehouse. The small dairy, with only 25 people working on a typical shift, makes 4,000 tonnes of Västerbottensost a year. After hearing all these stories, I finally got to taste Västerbottensost – sliced and served on bread most traditionally. However, the cafe offers a range of other dishes that highlight its versatility. You might find it with smoked salmon in a lasagne, with chicken in a pasta sauce or sprinkled on soup. If you’re lucky, you might even be able to try Västerbottensost ice cream, made by adding grated cheese to the cream and eggs before freezing – and best served with warm cloudberries or arctic brambles. I chose to accompany my cheese with some biscuits and fruit syrup.It was tangy, like Parmesan, but subtler and creamier with nutty and fruity notes. The otherwise smooth texture was pleasantly interrupted by the crunch of small crystals. It’s been said that the cheese encompasses all the major flavour categories: sweet, sour, salty and bitter, plus the all-important umami. Like a good wine, it was hard to pin down. Which of course made it my duty to take another chunk. And another one. So what is it about the process of making Västerbottensost that gives it this memorable flavour? Perhaps it would help to borrow another idea from wine: terroir, the unquantifiable combination of local conditions and culture that contribute to the final product. There may be no single factor that unlocks the secret to the cheese – but its enigmatic flavour could only be created here. If the theories were given marks for effort, though, the meteorite would have to win hands down. Given the closeness of this region to the edge of the world, it would certainly be appropriate if the answer came from outer space. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the location of the village of Burträsk. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"In the Swedish village of Burträsk, a hard yellow cheese called Västerbottensost is made, with a unique flavor that cannot be replicated outside the village despite extensive analysis and attempts to expand production. Theories for this phenomenon range from local conditions such as calcium-rich soil to the creation of a nearby lake by a meteorite, but the true reason remains a mystery."},{"instruction":"Q:Here's a question: What happens to the victim of someone committing a murder? Here are possible answers to this question: - pain - dead - distress - die - kill I believe the correct choice is \\"die\\", here's why: A:","output":"When a person becomes a victim of a murder, various consequences can ensue, depending on the context and extent of the crime. Hence, all the listed answers could be correct depending on the precise details of the situation. However, the central aspect of a murder involves taking the life of a victim, which directly corresponds to the given answer, \\"die.\\" Let's analyze each possible answer: 1. Pain: A victim of murder might experience physical pain during the incident, depending on the method employed by the murderer. However, not all murders necessarily involve pain (e.g., poisoning or sudden fatal injuries), so this answer is not entirely accurate. 2. Dead: This answer is correct from a general perspective, as the victim's eventual state after being murdered would be death. However, it does not provide sufficient context by itself. 3. Distress: Distress could potentially accompany the mental or emotional experience of the victim during a murder or even their loved ones who might suffer psychological trauma after the incident. Still, like pain, not all murder victims would necessarily experience distress. 4. Die: As stated earlier, this answer is the most accurate description of what happens to a murder victim as dying is the core consequence that defines murder. 5. Kill: This answer describes the action carried out by the murderer rather than what happens to the victim. While it is related to the overall act of murder, it does not specifically address the question of what happens to the victim. In summary, the answer \\"die\\" is the most appropriate choice when describing what happens to a murder victim, as it encapsulates the central aspect of various murder situations, the taking of a life. Other answers might be relevant in specific contexts, but \\"die\\" effectively captures the core element of murder."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

While the defendants were initially convicted of intent to incite a riot, the verdicts were overturned on appeal. At Woodstock in 1969, Hoffman reportedly interrupted The Who's performance to attempt to speak against the jailing of John Sinclair of the White Panther Party. He grabbed a microphone and yelled, \\"I think this is a pile of shit while John Sinclair rots in prison ...\\" Pete Townshend was adjusting his amplifier between songs and turned to look at Hoffman over his left shoulder. Townshend shouted \\"Fuck off! Fuck off my fucking stage!\\" and reportedly ran at Hoffman with his guitar and hit Hoffman in the back, although Townshend later denied attacking Hoffman. Townshend later said that while he actually agreed with Hoffman on Sinclair's imprisonment, he would have knocked him offstage regardless of the content of his message, given that Hoffman had violated the \\"sanctity of the stage,\\" i.e., the right of the band to perform uninterrupted by distractions not relevant to the show. The incident took place during a camera change, and was not captured on film. The audio of this incident, however, can be heard on The Who's box set, Thirty Years of Maximum R&B (Disc 2, Track 20, \\"Abbie Hoffman Incident\\"). In 1971's Steal This Book in the section \\"Free Communication,\\" Hoffman encourages his readership to take to the stage at rock concerts to use the pre-assembled audience and PA system to get their message out. However he mentions that \\"interrupting the concert is frowned upon since it is only spitting in the faces of people you are trying to reach.\\" In Woodstock Nation, Hoffman mentions the incident, and says he was on a bad LSD trip at the time. Joe Shea, then a reporter for the Times Herald-Record, newspaper that covered the event on-site, said he saw the incident. He recalled that Hoffman was actually hit in the back of the head by Townshend's guitar and toppled directly into the pit in front of the stage. He does not recall any \\"shove\\" from Townshend, and discounts both men's accounts. was anyone arrested at this point?","output":"The text provided does not specify or suggest that anyone was arrested immediately following the incident where Abbot Howard Hoffman interrupted The Who's performance at Woodstock in 1969.

In general, this phrase is used to describe an actor or element in a film that contributes significantly to its success, usually overshadowing other aspects of the film. Let's explore both positive and negative interpretations of the phrase. Positive interpretation: When used positively, \\"carry the movie\\" can be a compliment to an actor's performance or a particular aspect of the film that stands out significantly and elevates the overall experience for the audience. In this sense, the phrase suggests that the actor or element played a pivotal role in making the movie enjoyable or memorable. For example, if an actor delivers an incredibly strong performance that sustains the audience's interest and keeps them captivated, one might say that the actor \\"carried the movie.\\" This would imply that the actor's talent and skill had a significant impact on the movie's success, and their presence in the film likely contributed to drawing both positive attention and praise from viewers and critics alike. Negative interpretation: Conversely, \\"carry the movie\\" can also be used negatively, meaning that an actor or element of the film had to compensate for the lack of substance or quality in other aspects. In this context, the phrase is not necessarily a criticism of the actor or element itself but rather an indication that the movie relied too heavily on that single outstanding feature, which may indicate that other aspects of the film were weak or underdeveloped. For example, if a film has a weak script or poor production values but still manages to generate buzz because of a standout performance by a particular actor, someone might say that the actor had to \\"carry the movie.\\" This would imply that, without the actor's contribution, the movie would not have been as successful or well-received, highlighting shortcomings in other areas of the film. In conclusion, the phrase \\"carry the movie\\" can have both positive and negative connotations, and its interpretation relies heavily on the context in which it is used. To determine the intended meaning, it is essential to consider the broader discussion surrounding the film and the specific aspects that are being praised or criticized."},{"instruction":"How do you figure out who wins when you play games? - learn - keep score - try to win - fun - require time to be kept The best answer is Answer:","output":"When it comes to figuring out who wins when you play games, there are various factors to consider. These include learning the rules, keeping score, trying to win, having fun, and adhering to the time requirements. While the outcome of a game can depend on various factors such as individual skill, strategy, and luck, understanding these aspects will help you determine the winner and enjoy the game more fully. 1. Learn the rules: The first step to determine the winner in any game is to learn and understand the rules. Each game has a unique set of guidelines that dictate how it's played and how the winner is decided. For example, in chess, the player who checkmates their opponent's king is the winner. In poker, the winner is the player with the highest-ranking hand at the end of the final betting round. Familiarizing yourself with the rules of the specific game you're playing will help you identify the conditions for victory. 2. Keep score: In games that involve accumulating points, keeping an accurate score is essential. Typically, scores are tallied throughout the game, and the player with the most points at the end is declared the winner. Depending on the game, points can be gained through various actions such as scoring goals, capturing pieces, or completing tasks. Scorekeeping can be done using pen and paper, a scoreboard, or an electronic device like a smartphone or tablet. 3. Try to win: While playing games should primarily be about having fun, striving to win is also important. Being competitive can improve your skills, help you learn from your mistakes, and make the game more engaging for all players involved. Developing strategies and honing your skills will increase your chances of winning. 4. Have fun: Ultimately, playing games should be an enjoyable experience, regardless of the outcome. Whether you're winning or losing, maintaining a positive attitude and focusing on the fun aspects of the game can make it more satisfying for everyone. Playing with friends and family can help turn games into a social activity, creating memorable experiences and fostering camaraderie. 5. Time requirements: Some games require a specific amount of time to be played, either for the entire game or for individual turns. Time constraints can add an extra layer of challenge and excitement, as players must make decisions and execute their strategies within a limited period. Monitoring time can be done using a timer, a clock, or a dedicated device like a chess clock. In conclusion, determining the winner in any game involves a combination of learning the rules, keeping score, trying to win, having fun, and staying within the time requirements. By focusing on these factors, you will be able to enjoy a myriad of games, improve your skills, and ultimately, figure out who comes out victorious."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue - What might be the first step of the process?

The energy star designation is given to energy-efficient appliances in a program sponsored by the environmental protection agency and the department of energy. Realize energy savings of about 20 percent by using a convection oven, which circulates air around the food you are cooking. pick from the following. (i) Consider purchasing microwaves, which power energy at a rate of 100 percent. Protect the amount of energy you use in the household by using the energy star designation when you're doing something else.. (ii) This is a moderately low-heat oven that allows more power to be used. This is going to consist significantly more energy than it would if the oven itself were about 1 kilowatt.. (iii) A convection oven functions to heat up the air all around the food. This means that the food will heat up faster quickly, which in turn results in fewer calories hitting your food.. (iv) Convection ovens work better the more surface area the food has. That is, they will work better on cookies or muffins than banana bread..","output":"(iv) Convection ovens work better the more surface area the food has. That is, they will work better on cookies or muffins than banana bread. This means you should adapt your cooking methods based on the appliance and type of food to conserve energy. Denser foods such as banana bread or meat loaves might take more time and energy to cook, as the heat needs to penetrate deeper. Conversely, food items with more surface area heat up and cook more quickly in a convection oven due to the movement of hot air, saving energy. Further, you can adopt some more efficient cooking practices with a convection oven. For example, you can cook multiple dishes at once. Since food cooks faster in a convection oven, you can efficiently utilize the space and energy. This would result in a significant reduction of energy use in comparison to cooking single dishes one after another. Additionally, try to avoid opening the oven door frequently when cooking, as every time the door is opened, heat escapes, making the appliance work harder and use more energy. Moreover, it's not just the oven you can optimize for energy usage. There are many other ways you can reduce energy use in the kitchen. For instance, using smaller appliances such as toaster ovens or microwave ovens for small meals rather than the large conventional oven; using pressure cookers, which take less time and thus save energy; or making sure your appliances are in good working order, as damaged appliances can lead to increased energy usage. Moreover, good planning and strategic appliance use can also lead to greater energy savings. For example, if you run your dishwasher at night, you'll be using electricity at a time when there's less demand and hence, the cost is lower. Or, in winter, you can exploit the heat from the oven spill-over to help heat the house. Last but not least, be mindful of your refrigerator usage. Try to decide what you need before you open the fridge door to reduce the amount of time that it remains open, and thus the amount of energy wasted. Also, allow hot foods to cool down before you put them in the refrigerator to avoid making it work harder to keep things cold. Through these steps, you can significantly reduce energy use in your kitchen, leading to lower energy bills and a more sustainable household."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A jobless man applied for the position of \\"office boy\\" at Microsoft.The HR manager interviewed him and then watched him cleaning the floor as a test.\\"You are employed,\\" he said.\\"Give me your e-mail address and I'll send you the application to fill in, as well as the date when you may start.\\" The man replied, \\"But I don't have a computer, neither an e-mail.\\" \\"I'm sorry,\\" said the HR manager.\\"If you don't have an email, that means you do not exist.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is on ventilation happens, how will it affect HELPING the dishwasher to clean better. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis presented in this scenario involves a person being on ventilation, and it explores the possibility of this event having an effect (direct or indirect) on the process of a dishwasher cleaning dishes. While this situation might seem unrelated to the dishwasher's functioning, it is important to evaluate if there is, indeed, any potential impact the person's condition might have on the dishwasher's cleaning ability. First, let's consider if the person on ventilation has a direct effect on the dishwasher's process. As described, the dishwasher's process involves multiple stages, such as heating and spraying water, adding detergent, draining dirty water, rinsing, draining again, and then drying the dishes. In all of these steps, there is no mention or indication that the functioning of the dishwasher is reliant upon any external biological factors, such as the health or well-being of a person. The dishwasher is an automated, self-contained unit that receives input in the form of water, electricity, and detergent and operates through a preprogrammed cleaning cycle. Therefore, the person on ventilation should ideally not have any direct impact on the dishwasher's performance. Now, let's examine whether an indirect effect might exist between the person on ventilation and the dishwasher's process. One possible way this scenario could indirectly relate is through the environment the person and the dishwasher share. For example, if the person on ventilation lives in an area where water or power supply is limited due to their medical condition, it might affect the efficiency of the dishwasher. However, even in such cases, the indirect effect seems rather negligible, as the dishwasher's performance is primarily determined by its internal design and mechanics, as well as the water pressure and power supply present in the individual household. These external factors would likely remain constant regardless of the person's presence or medical condition, as long as the necessary power and water supply are maintained. Therefore, based on this analysis, it appears that the perturbation hypothesis of the person on ventilation affecting the dishwasher's ability to clean better does not have a significant or substantial direct or indirect effect on the dishwasher's process. The cleaning process in a dishwasher is mostly determined by its internal mechanics and the resources available, such as water pressure, power supply, and detergent, which are largely independent of the person's medical condition."},{"instruction":"The Tories are to recruit members online rather than making people join the party through local associations.

The only omitted extant mammal group is the egg - laying monotremes . The earliest known therian mammal fossil is Juramaia , from the Middle Jurassic of China . However , molecular data suggests that therians may have originated even earlier , during the Early Jurassic . - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - An endotherm (from Greek \\"endon\\" \\"within\\" and \\"therm\\" \\"heat\\") is an organism that maintains its body at a metabolically favorable temperature, largely by the use of heat set free by its internal bodily functions instead of relying almost purely on ambient heat. Such internally generated heat is mainly an incidental product of the animal's routine metabolism, but under conditions of excessive cold or low activity an endotherm might apply special mechanisms adapted specifically to heat production. Examples include special-function muscular exertion such as shivering, and uncoupled oxidative metabolism such as within brown adipose tissue. Only birds and mammals are extant universally endothermic groups of animals. Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic. - A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur. - Theriiformes is a subclass of mammals. The term was coined in 1997 by McKenna & Bell in their classification of mammals. - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\". - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period. - Sparassodonta is an extinct order of carnivorous metatherian mammals native to South America. They were once considered to be true marsupials, but are now thought to be either a sister taxon to them, or considerably distantly related, part of a separate clade of Gondwanan metatherians. A number of these mammalian predators closely resemble placental predators that evolved separately on other continents, and are cited frequently as examples of convergent evolution. They were first described by Florentino Ameghino, from fossils found in the Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia. Sparassodonts were present throughout South America's long period of \\"splendid isolation\\" during the Cenozoic; during this time they shared the niches for large warm-blooded predators with the flightless terror birds. Previously, it was thought that these mammals died out in the face of competition from \\"more competitive\\" placental carnivorans during the Pliocene Great American Interchange, but more recent research has showed that sparassodonts died out long before eutherian carnivores arrived in South America (aside from procyonids). - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - The middle ear is the portion of the ear internal to the eardrum, and external to the oval window of the inner ear. Also the mammalian middle ear contains three ossicles, which transfer the vibrations of the eardrum into waves in the fluid and membranes of the inner ear. The hollow space of the middle ear is also known as the tympanic cavity. The auditory tube (also known as the Eustachian tube or the pharyngotympanic tube) joins the tympanic cavity with the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), allowing pressure to equalize between the middle ear and throat. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. - The neocortex, also called the neopallium and isocortex, is the part of the mammalian brain involved in higher-order brain functions such as sensory perception, cognition, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning and language. - Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis, or skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin. - Sauropsida (\\"lizard faces\\") is a group of amniotes that includes all existing birds and reptiles as well as their fossil ancestors and other extinct relatives. Large land animals are either in this group or in its sister group, Synapsida, which includes mammals and their fossil relatives. This clade includes Parareptilia and other extinct clades. All living sauropsids are members of the sub-group Diapsida, the Parareptilia clade having died out 200 million years ago. The term originated in 1864 with Thomas Henry Huxley, who grouped birds with reptiles based on fossil evidence. - Metatheria is a mammalian clade that includes all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals (such as sparassodontans). First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880, it is a slightly more inclusive group than the marsupials; it contains all of the living mammals with abdominal pouches (most female marsupials) as well as their more primitive ancestors and relatives. Metatherians are one of three main classes of extant mammals: monotremes (egg laying mammals like the platypus and the echidna), metatheria (or marsupials, which includes the three American orders (Didelphimorphia, Paucituberculata and Microbiotheria) and the four Australasian orders (Notoryctemorphia, Dasyuromorphia, Peramelemorphia and Diprotodontia)), and the eutherians (or placental mammals) consisting of twenty-one orders, divided into four superorders. Metatherians belong to a subgroup of the northern tribosphenic mammal clade or Boreosphenida. They differ from all other mammals in certain morphologies like their dental formula, which includes about five upper and four lower incisors, a canine, three premolars, and four molars. Other morphologies include skeletal and anterior dentition, such as wrist and ankle apomorphies; all metatherians share derived pedal characters and calcaneal features.

Intrigued by the discovery and its possible significance, Ryker contacts the military's cultural expert, Dr. Elizabeth Carter, to examine the artifact. Dr. Carter arrives at the site and discovers that the statue holds an enigmatic power: it possesses the ability to open a portal to the past. However, this power can only be unlocked by disassembling the statue using a weapon that bears the scars of war - an M-16. Realizing the enormous potential this discovery holds, Dr. Carter and Sergeant Ryker's squad cooperate to unlock the secret while keeping it out of enemy hands. As they work tirelessly to take apart the statue with precision and care, relationships between soldiers and Dr. Carter intensify. Among the squad members is a young soldier named Private Tyler Adams, who forms a close bond with Dr. Carter and shares a tragic backstory, having lost his brother in the ongoing conflict. Meanwhile, the rival faction, led by the vindictive and cunning General Khaled, uncovers the secret of the statue. Desperate to rewrite his troubled past, Khaled plots to steal the artifact and use it for his own twisted purposes. Ryker's squad and Dr. Carter manage to disassemble the statue and activate the portal just as General Khaled and his forces close in on them.

Smith and his wife Cornelia Caroline McTyeire. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Auburn University (then known as Alabama Polytechnic Institute) in 1901. He had already decided on a military career and had become first sergeant of a cavalry company in the Alabama National Guard. However, he obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Alabama in 1903 and practiced law in Montgomery, Alabama for a year. Returning to the United States in April 1919, Smith's assignments in the next four years included duty at Norfolk, Virginia, study at the Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island, and service in Washington, D.C., with the War Plans Section of the Office of Naval Operations. There, he was the first Marine officer to serve on the Joint Army-Navy Planning Committee. Leaving Washington in May 1923, he served aboard the battleships Wyoming and Arkansas as Fleet Marine Officer, U.S. Scouting Fleet, until September of that year. In February 1924, after serving at Marine Corps Headquarters and in the West Indies in connection with joint Army-Navy maneuvers, Smith joined the Marine Brigade on expeditionary duty in Haiti, serving as that unit's Chief of Staff and Officer in Charge of Operations and Training. He returned from that country in August 1925, to serve as chief of staff of the 1st Marine Brigade at Quantico, Virginia, until September 1926, as a student in the Marine Corps School, Quantico, from then until June 1927, and as Post Quartermaster of the Marine Barracks, Philadelphia Navy Yard, from July 1927 to March 1931.

Came here after Christmas. The hotel itself looks amazing on the outside with some arts here and there and a nice fountain located in the main entrance cul-de-sac. The layout inside is a different story though. The fitness center and spa/salon was on the \\"promenade\\" level where you had to walk through shops to get to. Personally, I would think the fitness and spa area should be more close and inclusive to the actual hotel rooms. Another layout flaw is that the main entrance is different from the main valet area. Now comes the worst part of this hotel: terrible customer service. Booked rooms through a third party site and when arrived they told me I had to pay more for a 2 bedroom queen b/c it was previously not listed on the website when I first booked it. (the excuse was that they thought the 2 bed queens were gonna sell out so the didn't list it on the site). Ok then are you assuming that any two person party coming to your hotel is a couple? Moving on, I requested a higher floor room and the guy at the front desk said \\"I'll let u know\\" and keeps typing away. Later doesn't even inform me which floor is available. He just makes me sign some papers and I find out he gave us the 10th floor. Great.. thanks for listening guy. The rooms are \\"technologically advanced\\" but the controls are not as smooth especially the temperature functions through the remote. Also, the bathroom was not stocked when arrived. Second day, housekeeping stocked the shampoo et al better. Gross part of the room: there was a piece of fried chicken underneath the entertainment center!!!! Is this really a 5 star hotel? Lastly, the jean phillipe pasterie (sp?) had horrible customer service as well. Waited for 15mins for food. Asked if they might have forgotten my ticket. They gave me a lame excuse saying they had to wait for the panini. Really? I just saw 5 ppl in front of me get the same thing I just ordered.

Here's a breakdown of the issues mentioned in the review: 1. While the reviewer appreciates the hotel's exterior appearance and the art and fountain located at the main entrance, they find the interior layout to be poorly designed. 2. Issues with the location of the fitness center and spa, making them difficult to access for hotel guests. 3. Inconvenient separation of the main entrance and valet area. 4. Terrible customer service experienced during the booking process, specifically mentioning the need to pay more for a different room type due to the information on the third-party listing. 5. Unsatisfactory interaction with the front desk staff member regarding room placement. 6.

Poor initial stocking of the bathroom and unhygienic conditions, including finding a piece of fried chicken underneath the entertainment center, which the reviewer uses to question the hotel's 5-star rating. 8. Negative experience at the in-hotel bakery due to poor customer service and long wait times.

A. Tittle, was a professional American football quarterback. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts, after spending two seasons with the Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Known for his competitiveness, leadership, and striking profile, Tittle was the centerpiece of several prolific offenses throughout his seventeen-year professional career from 1948 to 1964. Tittle played college football for Louisiana State University, where he was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) quarterback for the LSU Tigers football team. At the time of his retirement, Tittle held the following NFL records: Tittle was the fourth player to throw seven touchdown passes in a game, when he did so in 1962 against the Redskins. He followed Sid Luckman (1943), Adrian Burk (1954), and George Blanda (1961). The feat has since been equaled by four more players: Joe Kapp (1969), Peyton Manning (2013), Nick Foles (2013), and Drew Brees (2015). Tittle, Manning and Foles did it without an interception. His 36 touchdown passes in 1963 set a record which stood for over two decades until it was surpassed by Dan Marino in 1984; as of 2016 it remains a Giants franchise record. Despite record statistics and three straight championship game appearances, Tittle was never able to deliver a title to his team. His record as a starter in postseason games was 0-4. He threw four touchdown passes against 14 interceptions and had a passer rating of 33.8 in his postseason career, far below his regular season passer rating of 74.3. Seth Wickersham, writing for ESPN The Magazine in 2014, noted the dichotomy in the 1960s between two of New York's major sports franchises: \\"... Gifford, Huff and Tittle, a team of Hall of Famers known for losing championships as their peers on the Yankees--with whom they shared a stadium, a city, and many rounds of drinks--became renowned for winning them.\\" The Giants struggled after Tittle's retirement, posting only two winning seasons from 1964 to 1980. He made seven Pro Bowls, four first-team All-Pro teams, and four times was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player or Player of the Year: in 1957 and 1962 by the UPI; in 1961 by the NEA; and in 1963 by the AP and NEA. In a sports column in 1963, George Strickler for the Chicago Tribune remarked Tittle had \\"broken records that at one time appeared unassailable and he has been the hero of more second half rallies than Napoleon and the Harlem Globetrotters.\\" He was featured on four Sports Illustrated covers: three during his playing career and one shortly after retirement. His first was with the 49ers in 1954. With the Giants, he graced covers in November 1961, and he was on the season preview issue for 1964; a two-page fold-out photo from the 1963 title game. Tittle was on a fourth cover in August 1965. The trade of Tittle for Lou Cordileone is seen as one of the worst trades in 49ers history; it is considered one of the best trades in Giants franchise history. Cordileone played just one season in San Francisco. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Y.A. Tittle was a very good American football player who played as a quarterback. He played for three different teams: San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts. He also played college football at Louisiana State University. Y.A. Tittle was famous because he threw lots of touchdown passes, which means he helped his team score many points. Even though he was really good at football, his teams didn't win any championships with him. He was chosen for special awards and was on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine four times. But when he left his team, the 49ers, for the Giants, people later thought it was a bad trade for the 49ers since he played so well for the Giants."},{"instruction":"Please write a short summary for the following article: Don't misread Obama's handshake with Raul Castro Editor's note: Ruben Navarrette is a CNN contributor and a nationally syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group. Follow him on Twitter @rubennavarrette. (CNN) -- Make no mistake. A handshake is just a handshake. Fifty-year-old geopolitical conflicts don't turn on a dime. American foreign policy isn't an Etch A Sketch where you get to wipe the board clean in every news cycle. Between countries, as with people, grudges and hard feelings don't fade easily. These things are true no matter how eager some in the media are to give President Barack Obama's sagging job approval rating -- just 41% in a recent Gallup Poll -- a boost by likening him to Nelson Mandela. Seriously? There is far-fetched, and there is farcical. Comparing Obama to Mandela falls into the latter category. And all because of a simple handshake? Obama briefly shook hands with Cuban President Raul Castro at the memorial for the former South African president. Now everyone in the media wants to know if there is a thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations. The preferred narrative is that as Mandela healed the breach between white and black South Africans, perhaps Obama will now heal the relationship between the United States and Cuba. A columnist has to know his limitations. Whenever I write about Cuba, the first thing I have to overcome is my sense of ambivalence. I'm a Mexican-American living in Southern California, not a Cuban-American living in South Florida. The only Castro brothers I get worked up about -- Julian, the mayor, and Joaquin, the congressman -- live in San Antonio, not Havana. Not that I don't understand why my Cuban-American friends still hold a grudge and take a hard line against the Castro regime, just like their parents and grandparents before them. For instance, I wasn't at all surprised that Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- whose Cuban-born father was imprisoned and tortured in the years before Fidel Castro rose to power and who traveled to South Africa to pay his respects to Mandela as a champion of freedom -- walked out during Raul Castro's speech. Nor was I surprised when Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba, cross-examined Secretary of State John Kerry during a congressional hearing. \\"Mr. Secretary, sometimes a handshake is just a handshake, but when the leader of the free world shakes the bloody hand of a ruthless dictator like Raul Castro, it becomes a propaganda coup for the tyrant,\\" she said. \\"Raul Castro uses that hand to sign the orders to repress and jail democracy advocates.\\" Kerry insisted that there was no change in U.S. policy toward Cuba, and that Obama had been clear in his remarks at the memorial that all nations had the duty to uphold \\"the basic human rights of their people\\" and that Cuba isn't doing that. Cuban-Americans are right to keep up their efforts to draw the attention of the international community to the atrocious human rights record of the Cuban government and the systematic abuse that the regime inflicts upon its own people. Eventually, as I thought more about the handshake felt around the world, I finally put my finger on what was bothering me about the Obama-as-Reconciler-In-Chief storyline. First, aren't liberals and other Obama supporters -- the very people who are now advancing the idea that the handshake was an example of \\"Mandela-style\\" reconciliation -- the same folks who have spent the past few weeks focused on the botched rollout of Obamacare complaining that the expectations on Obama are too high? So now what do they do? They raise expectations even higher. This makes no sense. Next, I'm not even sure that Obama knows how to bring people together. In his five years in office, he has mastered the art of division. He pits the poor against the rich, the elderly who help run up staggering deficits against the young who will someday have to pay them off. Finally, I think of one other handshake between Obama and a Latin American leader that led, well, nowhere. In April 2009, just a few months into his presidency, Obama shook hands with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at the Summit of the Americas. Chavez clashed often with George W. Bush, and so he probably couldn't have been happier to be rid of him. But, just a little more than two years later, in December 2011, Chavez attacked Obama as a \\"clown\\" and an \\"embarrassment.\\" He also sent a message to Obama, telling him that he should \\"focus on governing your country, which you've turned into a disaster\\" and \\"leave us in peace ... Go after your votes by fulfilling that which you promised your people.\\" What set Chavez off were comments that Obama made during an interview with the Caracas-based El Universal newspaper in which he criticized Venezuelans' business and political ties to Iran and Cuba and raised concerns about the Venezuelan government, which had, Obama said, \\"restricted the universal rights of the Venezuelan people, threatened basic democratic values and failed to contribute to security in the region.\\" Obama was in the right. Everything he said in that interview was true. And, unlike handshakes that quickly fade from memory, the truth endures. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","output":"In this article, the author argues that President Barack Obama's handshake with Cuban President Raul Castro should not be overanalyzed and it does not signify a thaw in US-Cuba relations. The article highlights the media's tendency to exaggerate the importance of such gestures and provides an example of another handshake between Obama and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, which led to no significant improvement in their relationship. Ruben Navarrette emphasizes that geopolitical conflicts don't change overnight and that a handshake is just a handshake."},{"instruction":"Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Falcons, the Lions played their Week 2 home opener against their NFC North foe, the Green Bay Packers. In the first quarter, Detroit trailed as Packers QB Aaron Rodgers completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR James Jones. In the second quarter, the Lions continued to trail as Rodgers completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Donald Driver and a 29-yard TD pass to WR Jordy Nelson. Detroit closed out the first half when kicker Jason Hanson nailed a 38-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Lions continued to hack away at Green Bay's lead with Hanson kicking 49-yard and then 53-yard field goals. The Packers responded when kicker Mason Crosby nailed a 25-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Detroit clawed away at the Pack's lead when QB Jon Kitna completed a 38-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson. The Lions closed in as the snap to Packers punter Derrick Frost was high, causing it to go through the back of his end zone, giving Detroit a safety. The Lions took the lead on Kitna's 47-yard TD pass to Calvin Johnson. However, Green Bay rebounded with Crosby's 39-yard field goal, RB Brandon Jackson's 19-yard TD run, CB Charles Woodson's 41-yard interception return for a touchdown, and safety Nick Collins' 42-yard interception return for a touchdown.

As authorities continue their investigation, they've discovered that the missing doctor may have nurtured a deeply-rooted obsession with a famous singer, which could have played a role in their disappearance. Step 2: Introduce the details about the missing Michigan doctor. Dr. Jane Smith, a highly-regarded physician at a prominent Michigan hospital, was last seen on November 1st, leaving her clinic after a long day of work. Colleagues described her as dedicated and compassionate, leaving those who knew her perplexed about her sudden disappearance. As days turned into weeks with no sign of the good doctor, authorities have begun to investigate every possible lead. Step 3: Introduce the connection between the doctor and the famous singer. During their investigation, authorities found what appeared to be an extensive collection of memorabilia related to the internationally acclaimed singer, Angelica Martinez, in Dr. Smith's home. They also discovered that Dr. Smith had attended several of Martinez's concerts and had even taken time off work to travel to another state for a performance. Step 4: Explain the possible implications of the doctor's obsession. While attending concerts or collecting memorabilia may be considered ordinary fan behavior, the intensity of Dr. Smith's interest in Martinez has led investigators to ponder its potential connection to her disappearance. Did the doctor grow increasingly detached from reality and decide to start a new life pursuing her obsession? Or did her admiration for the singer land her in a precarious situation? Step 5: Address the famous singer's reaction and involvement in the case. Upon learning of Dr. Smith's disappearance and her evident obsession, Angelica Martinez took to social media to express her concern and urge anyone with information to come forward. The singer made it clear that she does not condone any unhealthy or dangerous behavior connected to her or her music. Step 6: Summarize the ongoing investigation. Authorities continue to interview family, friends, and colleagues of Dr. Smith in an effort to uncover any clues that may shed light on her whereabouts. Local residents have also been encouraged to stay vigilant, report any suspicious activity, and lend a helping hand in the search for the missing doctor. Step 7: Conclude the article with a call to action and some empathy. As the investigation into the mysterious disappearance of Dr. Jane Smith carries on, it is important to remember the incredible impact she has left on her community. Her dedication to healing and wellness will not be forgotten, and her loved ones deserve answers. Anyone who may have information regarding Dr. Smith's whereabouts is encouraged to contact their local authorities immediately. With each step, I aimed to cover all pertinent information about the missing Michigan doctor while tying in her alleged obsession with the famous singer. This helped to present a thorough and well-rounded article that informs readers and encourages them to participate in the ongoing search for Dr. Jane Smith."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence in English.","output":"The sun is shining brightly in the sky.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Mount Vesuvius ( also \\"Vesevus\\" or \\"Vesaevus\\" in some Roman sources) is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about east of Naples and a short distance from the shore. It is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure. - A multi-sport event is an organized sports event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation states.

Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - International mostly means something (a company, language, or organization) involving more than a single country. The term international as a word means involvement of, interaction between or encompassing more than one nation, or generally beyond national boundaries. For example, international law, which is applied by more than one country and usually everywhere on Earth, and international language which is a language spoken by residents of more than one country. - The 1908 Summer Olympics, officially the Games of the IV Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event which was held in 1908 in London, England from 27 April to 31 October 1908. These games were originally scheduled to be held in Rome, but were re-located on financial grounds following a disastrous eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906. They were the fourth chronological modern Olympic Games in keeping with the now-accepted four-year cycle as opposed to the proposed Intercalated Games alternate four-year cycle. The IOC president for these Games was Baron Pierre de Coubertin. Lasting a total of 187 days, or 6 months and 4 days, these games were the longest in modern Olympics history. - The Free State of Saxony is a landlocked federal state of Germany, bordering the federal states of Brandenburg, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia, and Bavaria, as well as the countries of Poland (Lower Silesian and Lubusz Voivodeships) and the Czech Republic (Karlovy Vary, Liberec and Ústí nad Labem Regions). Its capital is Dresden, and its largest city is Leipzig. - The Intercalated Olympic Games were to be a series of \\"International Olympic Games\\" halfway between what is now known as the Games of the Olympiad. This proposed series of games, intercalated in the Olympic Games cycle, was to always be held in Athens, and were to have equal status with the international games. However, the only such games were held in 1906. - Karl Neumer ( 23 February 1887 in Reinhardtsgrimma -- 16 May 1984 ) was a German track cycling racer who competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics . He won two medals - bronze in the individual sprint and silver , together with his teammates Max Götze , Rudolf Katzer , and Hermann Martens , in the team pursuit .

The Creed family—Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage—move from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled \\"sematary\\") in the forest behind the Creed's new home. On his first day at work, Louis encounters Victor Pascow, a jogger who has been mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. That night, Pascow comes to Louis as a ghost and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \\"sour\\". Louis awakens, assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient Micmac burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns to the house, a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that as a boy he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, the young Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated, and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death.","output":"In the story mentioned in the article, the Creed family, consisting of Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage, befriends their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall after moving from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine. Louis has been offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine, and the family moves into a new home that is located near an isolated pet cemetery—misspelled \\"sematary\\"—in the forest. Jud Crandall, as the elderly neighbor, plays a significant role in the story as he introduces the Creed family to the mysterious pet cemetery and the ancient Micmac burial ground located deep in the woods beyond the cemetery. He helps Louis bury Ellie's cat, Church, in the burial ground after it is killed on the highway, and it returns to the house reanimated, albeit with a changed, vicious demeanor. As the story unfolds, tragedy strikes the Creed family again when young Gage is killed by a truck on the very same highway. Jud, who has grown close to the family, anticipates that Louis might be considering burying his son in the Micmac burial ground, even though Louis denies it. It is Jud's belief that his introduction of Louis to the ritual ground has unintentionally aroused the malevolent forces present there, thus playing a part in causing Gage's death. In conclusion, the elderly neighbor who befriends the Creed family in the story is Jud Crandall, an important character who acts as a guide and confidant to Louis Creed. He plays a pivotal role in unveiling the mysteries of the pet cemetery and the ancient Micmac burial ground while attempting to help the family cope with their tragic losses."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who recognises the woman in the painting as the Marchesa Attavanti? , can you please find it?

The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the \\"hidden harmony\\" (\\"Recondita armonia\\") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving. Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place. Tosca enters and suspiciously asks Cavaradossi what he has been doing – she thinks that he has been talking to another woman. Cavaradossi reassures her and Tosca tries to persuade him to take her to his villa that evening: \\"Non la sospiri, la nostra casetta\\" (\\"Do you not long for our little cottage\\"). She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she recognises as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi explains the likeness; he has merely observed the Marchesa at prayer in the church. He reassures Tosca of his fidelity and asks her what eyes could be more beautiful than her own: \\"Qual'occhio al mondo\\" (\\"What eyes in the world\\").

Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. In 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related — for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts, and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors. In fact, prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant — the elevator operator. However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged. This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by Elisha Graves Otis. In addition, a oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact. However, In Thailand, in November 2012, a woman was killed in free falling elevator, in what was reported as the \\"first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift\\".","output":"Title: \\"The Unparalleled Safety Record of Cable-Borne Elevators: A Look at Their Safety Mechanisms and Rare Accidents\\""},{"instruction":"Question: \\"Billy Fury\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

The City of London Corporation confirmed it had suspended legal action against demonstrators until the morning, when the situation will be reviewed. A spokesman said: 'We have not handed them (the protesters) a letter this afternoon.' Earlier a spokesman for St Paul's said the cathedral was not taking joint action with the City of London Corporation. Men (and women) at work: Protesters on the steps of St Paul's unfurled a banner on the steps of St Paul's Cathedral painting their action as essential improvements. Reprieve: Protesters were due to be served with legal notices today by the City of London Corporation, but it is now scheduled to happen in the morning. 'Members of Chapter met yesterday following the resignation of the Dean and are due to meet with the Bishop of London today,' the spokesman said. 'The Chapter have not yet sought an injunction, nor are they serving notices on the protesters today. 'They are committed to a peaceful resolution at all costs.' There were fears today that a split among senior Church of England figures on how to deal with the protest could lead to the camp remaining on the steps of St Paul's during next year's Olympic Games and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Concerns that legal action could lead to violent evictions has led to the Church's liberal wing - led by Archbishop Rowan Williams - to oppose moves to support the City of London Corporation's plans. The split could mean that some protesters would be moved from the City's land but could be allowed to remain in the shadow of St Paul's indefinitely. Authorities were given a possible foretaste of any eviction they may be forced to carry out in the early hours of this morning when police arrested 12 protesters outside Parliament Square. They were among a group of up to 200 demonstrators who are opposed plans to criminalise the act of squatting homes and other building. A protester lies before three policemen in Parliament Square during the demonstration against plans to criminalise squatting. Last night the Archbishop of Canterbury broke his silence on the protesters camped outside St Paul's Cathedral, saying he sympathised with the 'urgent larger issues' they raised. In a sign of the panic within the Church of England high command since the arrival of the activists, Dr Rowan Williams intervened yesterday after the dean of the cathedral became the third member of staff to resign. Indicating his support for the anti-capitalists' aims, the Archbishop said: 'The urgent larger issues raised by the protesters at St Paul's remain very much on the table. Archbishop: Dr Rowan Williams has kept his counsel since the protest began but, after the resignation of Dean of St Paul's Cathedral, Graeme Knowles, he has spoken and backed the demonstrators. 'We need – as a Church and as society as a whole – to work to make sure that they are properly addressed.' The Archbishop's intervention was sparked by the resignation yesterday of the Dean of St Paul's, the Right Reverend Graeme Knowles. The dean caused controversy when he closed the historic building's doors last month for the first time since the Second World War, citing 'health and safety concerns' over the tents. The cathedral reopened last week but the dean said yesterday his position had become 'untenable' amid the ongoing row. The Archbishop's endorsement of the right of the protesters to campaign showed just how confused the Church of England remains in its response to the encampment on its doorstep. His remarks came as the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, confirmed yesterday that legal efforts to persuade the activists to leave have begun. Stepping down: The Dean of St Paul's, the Rt Rev Graeme Knowles, pictured yesterday speaking to demonstrators camped outside the Cathedral, has resigned. 'Untenable': Rt Rev Knowles became the second of the cathedral's senior clergy to resign in less than a week. Trouble brewing: The Bishop of London (centre) and a protestor in the tea tent yesterday. The bishop stressed that cathedral officials did not want a violent eviction. The. dean's departure followed Canon Chancellor of St Paul's, Giles Fraser –. who had told police to leave the activists alone after their arrival on. October 15 – and part-time chaplain Fraser Dyer. The Occupy London protesters were showing no signs of leaving despite the cathedral's requests. Dr Williams said the dean's departure was 'very sad news'. He. added: 'The events of the last couple of weeks have shown very clearly. how decisions made in good faith by good people under unusual pressure. can have utterly unforeseen and unwelcome consequences, and the clergy. of St Paul's deserve our understanding. Graeme Knowles will be much. missed.' 'Move beyond slogans': The Bishop of London has criticised demonstrators' methods. An unlikely crowd: A demonstrator directs questions to Rt Rev Knowles (second from right), and the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres (right) at the weekend. Crowd: The bishop and dean addressed a crowd of hundreds by the steps of St Paul's. Yesterday a. significant protester splinter group refused even to support the. cathedral's requests for drink, drugs and loud music to be banned from. the protest camp. They. appeared largely bemused by the resignation of the dean – which he had. to yesterday submit to the Queen, since his job is a crown appointment. Their. reluctance to leave was indicated by placards saying 'Hell no we won't. go' and 'Jesus did not quit – he drove the money lenders from the. temple'. The Government is considering whether the law needs to be tightened to deal with protests such as that being held outside St Paul's Cathedral. Justice minister Nick Herbert said everyone had a right to 'make their views known'. But he insisted it was not right to 'disrupt the life of the community' by setting up encampments. 'Everybody agrees there should be a right of peaceful protest in our country,' Mr Herbert told the BBC's Politics Show. 'People have an entitlement to make their view known. It's fundamental to our democracy and the coalition is committed to protect that. 'But we saw - for instance in Parliament Square, where there was a permanent encampment which had gone on for years there and was very disruptive to the enjoyment of Parliament Square by others. 'You cannot protest peacefully at Parliament Square because it is closed off to others. We are taking action to deal with that. 'And if necessary we will take action to deal with other invasions of private property that involved permanent encampments.' He went on: 'We want to protect peaceful protest. We do not think that it's right to disrupt the life of the community, and trespass, and permanently to set up and live somewhere - just as travellers do - which invades private property.' In a statement Mr. Knowles, the dean for four years, said: 'Since the arrival of the. protesters' camp outside the cathedral, we have all been put under a. great deal of strain and have faced what would appear to be some. insurmountable issues. 'It. has become increasingly clear to me that, as criticism of the cathedral. has mounted in the press, media and in public opinion, my position as. dean of St Paul's was becoming untenable. 'In. order to give the opportunity for a fresh approach to the complex and. vital questions facing St Paul's, I have thought it best to stand down. as dean, to allow new leadership to be exercised.' St. Paul's spokesman the Right Reverend Michael Colclough said: 'We are. committed to doing all we can to find a way ahead that ensures the main. message of the protest is not only heard but properly attended to, and. in such a way that people in the local community, as well as our own. team, can do their work peacefully for the good of everyone.' The. Bishop of London explained that due to the 'great mystery' of the. Church of England's organisation, the cathedral made its own decisions. without control from him. But he said St Paul's officials had asked him. to help out in the protesters' row. He. went on: 'There are many diverse voices in the camp outside St Paul's,. but among them, serious issues are being articulated which the cathedral. has always sought to address.' The. bishop stressed that all in the church wanted a peaceful resolution,. but added said that any responsible organisation had to investigate its. legal powers. Outside, the. camp still numbers about 200 tents – but barely 50 protesters attended a. meeting yesterday afternoon to decide tactics. About. a quarter of those present indicated that they were reluctant to accept. basic requests from the cathedral for drink and drugs to be barred from. the site and the camp to be kept tidy. In. a statement, the group, whose official name is Occupy London Stock. Exchange, said: 'The management of St Paul's Cathedral is obviously. deeply divided over the position they have taken in response to our. cause – but our cause has never been directed at the staff of the. cathedral.' The real issue was 'challenging the unsustainable financial system that punishes the many and privileges the few', it added. Highlights:","output":"1.

The region became known as Portucale, Portugale, and simultaneously Portugália — the County of Portugal. Later the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of Christian Kingdoms in Northern Spain due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the kings offspring. With the forced abdication of Alfonso III \\"the Great\\" of Asturias by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms of León, Galicia and Asturias. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 (León and Galicia in 914, Asturias later) under the crown of León.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"The region that became known as Portugale is the County of Portugal, which was originally known as Portus Cale or Portucale."},{"instruction":"Test for natural language inference.

The law applies to sticks using Bluetooth to remotely trigger a phone to take a picture. The agency said unregistered sticks might interfere with other devices using the same radio frequencies. Selfie sticks into which smartphones can be slotted to take snaps of their owners beyond arm's length have proved hugely popular and the most sophisticated versions use the Bluetooth short-range radio technology to trigger a handset's shutter. Because they use Bluetooth, the devices are considered to be a \\"telecommunication device\\" and must be tested and registered with the South Korean agency that oversees such gadgets, an official at the Central Radio Management Office told the AFP newswire. \\"The announcement last Friday was really just to let people know that they need to be careful about what they sell,\\" said the official. The regulations published by the Office can impose fines or jail terms on those making and selling unregistered sticks. \\"We've had a lot of calls from vendors who think they might have been unknowingly selling uncertified products,\\" added the radio management office's spokesman. So far, the new regulations are not being rigorously enforced and there are no reports of the sellers of selfie sticks at attractions in South Korea being targeted by police. Even the official at the radio frequency watchdog wondered if the new regulation was going to make a difference to the sale of the sticks - whether or not they are registered. \\"It's not going to affect anything in any meaningful way, but it is nonetheless a telecommunication device subject to regulation, and that means we are obligated to crack down on uncertified ones,\\" said the spokesman. A summary of the above article is?","output":"South Korea's radio management agency has recently issued guidelines prohibiting the sale of unregistered selfie sticks that use Bluetooth technology to remotely trigger a phone to take a picture. The reason for this action is that unregistered sticks may interfere with other devices that operate on the same radio frequencies. Popularized by their utility in extending a phone's camera reach beyond arm's length, selfie sticks with Bluetooth capabilities are considered telecommunication devices. As a result, they must be tested and registered with the South Korean agency responsible for overseeing such gadgets. The Central Radio Management Office wants to ensure consumers and vendors alike are aware of the regulations to avoid legal penalties. Those found making and selling unregistered selfie sticks can face fines or even jail terms. Despite the new guidelines that have been published, there has not been strict enforcement or reports of vendors being targeted by the police so far. However, some vendors have expressed concern that they may have unintentionally sold uncertified products. While an official from the Central Radio Registration Office acknowledges the regulations may not immediately change the sale of selfie sticks, the office is still obligated to crack down on uncertified devices as part of their regulatory responsibility."},{"instruction":"I heard that Sasha named another cat after she got a new one.

Label the instances as \\"Original\\" or \\"Inversion\\" based on your judgment. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: His whole dream had become a nightmare and he wanted to get his dream back . Student:","output":"Part #1: Identifying the coordinating conjunction in a given sentence. Usage: In the sample sentence \\"His whole dream had become a nightmare and he wanted to get his dream back\\", the coordinating conjunction is 'and'. We know this because 'and' is one of the seven coordinating conjunctions listed in the task description ('for', 'and', 'nor', 'but', 'or', 'yet', 'so'). Part #2: Identifying the two coordinated clausal conjoints before and after the conjunction. Usage: The two coordinated clausal conjoints in the sentence are: \\"His whole dream had become a nightmare\\" and \\"he wanted to get his dream back\\". I deduced this because these two parts of the sentence can stand alone as individual sentences, which is a key characteristic of clausal conjoints. Part #3: Judging whether the order of two coordinated clausal conjoints have been inverted. Usage: The order of the two clauses has not been inverted in the given sentence. That's because the natural, logical flow of actions or events is followed in the sentence, i.e., his dream became a nightmare first, followed by his desire to get his dream back. This makes the sentence sound normal and natural. Part #4: Labeling the instances as \\"Original\\" or \\"Inversion\\" based on your judgment. Usage: Based on the judgment, the given sentence can be labeled as \\"Original\\". Here, \\"Original\\" indicates a normal, natural sentence where the order of actions makes logical sense and \\"Inversion\\" would mean that the order of the clauses makes the sentence sound unnatural."},{"instruction":"What is the answer to this question? when did the south china sea conflict start?","output":"The South China Sea conflict started many years ago, but it became more noticeable around the 1970s.

It was published from 1963 until 1982; since then, a number of one-shot issues have appeared without regularity. A second series, set in the New Riverdale universe, launched in September 2016. The series was adapted into a Saturday morning cartoon by Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1970 and a live-action motion picture by Universal Studios and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 2001. In March 2005, Archie Comics announced that a manga version of the title would be published, with art by Tania del Rio, who was also responsible for the manga makeover of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. The first such \\"Josie and the Pussycasts\\" story, \\"Opening Act\\" ran in Tales from Riverdale Digest #3 (August 2005) The band had previously appeared in manga form in issue Sabrina, The Teenage Witch #67 (August 2005). In Archie & Friends #96 (January 2006) the origin of the Pussycats was retconned. The manga version implies that none of the characters previously knew each other. Josie Jones was cut from the school choir, but met Valerie Smith and the two founded the band. They recruited Melody, whose idea it was to wear cat outfits. The band was not doing well at first, but Alex liked the group, though Alexandra could tell he was more interested in Josie. Alex's father let him be the manager as long as he did not use his wealth to help make them stars. In Sabrina the Teenage Witch #72 (February 2006), a stranger named Alan helped carry their equipment. Josie, already attracted to Alan, jealously thought there was an attraction between Alan and Melody. Alex hired him as their stagehand. The manga focused on the group's attempt to reach fame rather than on their career after they have already achieved it. It featured characters not seen in other comics, including Alan's younger sister Alison and the rival group the Vixens. The manga version was not popular among readers, who preferred the traditional style. Its final appearance was in Archie & Friends #104 (December 2006). A Katy Keene revival replaced it (both featured alongside each other in the latter part of the manga's run), though it, too, did not last. was the manga version different than the first version?","output":"Yes, the manga version of Josie and the Pussycats was different from the first version.

Answer the above question based on the context below: During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all.

Let's solve this math problem together step by step: So we have: 34789 = -3931*f - 33018 - 73709 First, let's add 33018 and 73709 to both sides of the equation to simplify it. We'll get: 34789 + 33018 + 73709 = -3931*f Now, let's add those big numbers: 140516 = -3931*f We're almost there! Now, we just need to find out what times -3931 equals 140516. So we'll divide 140516 by -3931: 140516 ÷ -3931 = f And if we do that division, we get: f = -35.753 So there you have it! The value of 'f' is around -35.753.

Question 2: If President Obama said he'd nuke Russia if they didn't provide 1T in 48 hours, what would happen? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"To answer these questions, I will take the following steps: Step 1: Identify the main difference between the two questions. Step 2: Analyze the potential political and global consequences for each hypothetical situation. Step 3: Determine if the questions are asking the same thing based on the analysis. Step 1: The main difference between the two questions is that in Question 1, President Putin threatens to nuke the US, while in Question 2, President Obama threatens to nuke Russia. Step 2: Question 1: If President Putin said he'd nuke the US if we didn't provide 1T in 48 hours, what would happen? Given the severity of the threat, there would likely be a series of urgent diplomatic negotiations and discussions between the US, Russia, and other global powers. Since the threat of a nuclear attack is extreme, the US might be forced to consider both economic and military options (sanctions, alliances, or even a potential preemptive strike). Question 2: If President Obama said he'd nuke Russia if they didn't provide 1T in 48 hours, what would happen? Similar to Question 1, this scenario would result in a series of urgent diplomatic negotiations and discussions involving multiple countries. The US might face potential global backlash for making such an aggressive threat, particularly from the allied countries of Russia. Russia would consider its own set of military and economic options to respond to the situation. Step 3: Although both questions involve the threat of a nuclear attack and a monetary demand, they are not asking the same thing. The main difference lies in which country is making the threat, which could alter the magnitude of potential consequences. Therefore, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

He cryptically promises his father he will \\"bring him home.\\" Rama joins a heavily armed 20-man elite police squad, including Officers Bowo and Dagu, Sergeant Jaka, and Lieutenant Wahyu, for a raid on a high-rise apartment block in Jakarta's slums. The team intends to capture crime lord Tama Riyadi, who, along with his two lieutenants Andi and Mad Dog, owns the block and lets criminals around the city rent rooms under his protection. Arriving undetected, the team sweeps the first floors and subdues various criminal tenants; they also temporarily detain an innocent, law-abiding tenant delivering medicine to his sick wife in apartment #726. Continuing undetected to the sixth floor, the team is spotted by a young lookout, who passes on the message to another adolescent lookout just before he is shot dead by Wahyu; but the latter youth raises the alarm. Tama calls down reinforcements and the SWAT team are brutally attacked. Thugs snipe two officers guarding the perimeter, eliminate two more in the SWAT van, and ambush several officers patrolling the first five floors. Cutting the lights, Tama announces over the PA system that the police are trapped on the sixth-floor stairwell, and he will grant free permanent residence to those who kill the intruders. In the darkness, the remaining team members are ambushed by shooters from above and behind, and the team is almost completely wiped out. Prior to the gunfight, Wahyu confesses to Jaka he has staged the mission so he can eliminate Tama, who is in league with many corrupt police officers, including himself. The mission is not officially sanctioned by the police command; nobody at HQ knows their location and thus there is no hope for reinforcements.

We get that anxious feeling that our precious life is slipping away while we're doing something so meaningless. But it's not always the length of the wait we find so unbearable. Some people camp outside Apple stores for an entire night just to get their hands on the latest product. But waiting 10 minutes in a grocery store just to buy a drink? Forget it. Our behavior when waiting is only partly decided by the length of the wait. \\"Often the psychology of queuing is more important than the statistics of the wait itself,\\" notes the MIT researcher Richard Larson. One apparent aspect of queuing psychology is that we get bored when we wait in line. This issue is solved in many ways, from magazines in hospital waiting rooms to mirrors in elevators so that we can check our appearance. We really hate it when we expect a short wait and then get a long one. But studies show that we are much more patient when we are given an idea of how long we'll be waiting. Walt Disney Co knows this better than anyone else. It posts estimated waiting times for attractions in its theme parks. But according to Larson, these times are overestimated so that visitors get to the front of the queue more quickly than they expect. It keeps them happy. But perhaps the biggest influence on our feelings about waiting in a line has to do with our sense of fairness. When it comes to queues, the universally acknowledged standard is first come, first served. Any departure from this principle is regarded as unfair and can lead to violent queue anger. You've probably experienced mild queue anger yourself in fast food restaurants, watching people in the other line zoom ahead of you, cursing yourself for having chosen the \\"wrong\\" line. In order to solve this problem, the serpentine line was invented. The serpentine line guides all customers into one big snaking queue, separated by ropes or barriers. When you reach the head of the queue, you are directed to the next available server, or teller, or customs official. The... Question: Walt Disney Co makes people queuing happily by _ .

By having his dad rape his mom next to his corpse. But while that first shocker drew cheers, this one is drawing fire. Here's what people are saying: In the book version, Cersei Lannister resists her brother Jaime's advances at first, but soon shifts to egging him on in almost porn-worthy fashion: \\"Hurry, quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now. Jaime Jaime Jaime. … Yes, my brother, sweet brother, yes, like that, yes, I have you, you're home now.\\" This is the second time the show has inserted a rape that wasn't in the books, making it \\"hard to shake the idea that Game of Thrones, the show, doesn't see a problem with pushing a scene from complicated, consensual sex to outright rape,\\" writes Sonia Saraiya at the A.V. Club. Since it's hard to see what statement is being made here, it looks like the show is \\"falling into the same trap that so much television does—exploitation for shock value. And, in particular, the exploitation of women's bodies.\\" \\"I couldn't help wonder if it was yet another instance of rape-as-a-plot-device,\\" writes Hayley Krischer at Salon. The writers appear to be using the scene to sever the characters' relationship forever, but \\"I can’t help but wonder if there could have been another way Jaime could crush Cersei, emotionally and physically, without having to overpower her sexually with his massive Kingsguard armor.\\" It may just be a badly shot scene; the episode's director, Alex Graves, tells Alan Sepinwall at HitFix that the sex \\"becomes consensual by the end, because anything for them ultimately results in a turn-on.\\" Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Jaime, echoes that sentiment. \\"I think that, for some people, it’s just going to look like rape. The intention is that it’s not just that,\\" he tells the Daily Beast. \\"It’s about two people who’ve had this connection for so many years, and much of it is physical .... It’s him trying to force her back and make him whole again.\\" If that's the intention, the show \\"completely failed,\\" writes Amanda Marcotte at Slate. \\"It's as straightforward a rape scene as you'll get on TV. … Graves' inability to see what he's put out there compromises Jaime's character, and, frankly, makes a joke of a very serious, very violent act.\\" Margaret Lyons agrees. Her headline on Vulture: \\"Yes, Of Course That Was Rape on Last Night’s Game of Thrones.\\" And anyway, \\"the [director's] idea that a rape could be 'consensual by the end' is grotesque and dangerous.\\" \\"For the first time, I'm concerned that Game of Thrones has made a mistake it can't take back—and one that sets a troubling precedent for the show's future,\\" writes Scott Meslow for The Week.

Critics argue that the show has inserted a rape scene that wasn't in the original books and might be exploiting the scene for shock value. Some have suggested that the writers may be using rape as a plot device to sever the characters' relationship. The episode's director, Alex Graves, and actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau defended the scene, stating that it becomes consensual by the end.

But there's another sport on campus that, although it doesn't grab as many headlines, is just as well respected in its circles.","output":"The topic of this discussion is sports at the University of Connecticut, primarily focusing on basketball and another well-respected sport on campus. The University of Connecticut, or UConn, is a well-known institution with a strong reputation in sports, particularly basketball. The men's and women's basketball teams are frequently the subject of conversation among sports enthusiasts, as they both have strong records and notable successes. They have both managed to garner national and international attention, particularly when they win national championships. UConn's men's basketball team has enjoyed an illustrious history, with four national championships under their belt, many appearances in the NCAA Tournament, and numerous successful seasons. Many of their players have gone on to enjoy successful professional careers in the NBA and internationally. The team has also produced several esteemed coaches, including the legendary Jim Calhoun, who led the team to three of its national championships. The women's basketball team has been no less impressive, led by the legendary coach Geno Auriemma, who took over in 1985. The UConn women's team has become a dominant force in college basketball, boasting eleven national championships, nineteen Final Four appearances, and a record-breaking 111-game winning streak. Geno Auriemma himself has been named the Naismith College Coach of the Year a record eight times and has been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. While basketball holds a prominent place in UConn's athletic department, it is not the only sport that has earned respect and recognition. One such sport that, despite not garnering as many headlines, has been highly successful at UConn is soccer. Both the men's and women's soccer teams have earned accolades for their strong performances on the field and impact on campus. The UConn men's soccer team, established in 1920, has built a strong tradition of success in both the regular season and championship play. They have won three NCAA national championships and boast numerous conference titles and tournament appearances. UConn's soccer program has seen many of its players go on to professional careers in Major League Soccer (MLS) and Europe. The team's passionate fan base, known as \\"The Goal Patrol,\\" creates a lively and intimidating atmosphere at home games in the school's Morrone Stadium. The women's soccer team, while not as storied as the men's, has also found success and respect on and off the field. They have made multiple appearances in the NCAA tournament and earned consistent recognition within their conference. The women's team has helped produce several professional players, national team members, and dedicated coaches who continue to grow the sport. In conclusion, the University of Connecticut is not just limited to its success in basketball but also excels in other well-respected sports such as soccer. While UConn basketball tends to dominate the conversation in sports circles, it is essential to recognize and appreciate the achievements of other athletic teams on campus. These athletes and their respective sports contribute to the overall spirit and reputation of the university and help foster a diverse and vibrant sports culture for students, faculty, and fans alike."},{"instruction":"Le Gouvernement appelle aussi à une situation plus équitable entre les sexes dans la monarchie espagnole.

The predicate is 'met'. The objects are 'several young students'. Step 3: Analyze the structure of the sentence: The sentence begins with an 'it'-cleft, which is a common sentence structure in English used for emphasis. The words \\"It was last night\\" emphasize when the described event occurred. Step 4: Look at the tense of the sentence: The tense of the sentence is past, which is indicated by 'met', the past tense of 'meet'. This is consistent with the use of 'last night' in the sentence, which also denotes a past event. Step 5: Check for subject-verb agreement: The subject 'policeman' is singular, and the verb 'met' agrees with this singular subject. Step 6: Check for proper sentence ending: The sentence correctly ends with a period, following English grammatical rules. Step 7: Consider overall coherency: The sentence is coherent, making a logical statement that the policeman met several young students in the park last night.

Surprisingly, since modern PR was largely an American invention, America's relations is being threatened by PR efforts in other countries. Ten years ago, for example, the world's top five public relations agencies were American-owned. In 1991, only one was. The British in particular are becoming more sophisticated and creative. A recent survey found that more than half of all British companies include PR as part of their corporate planning activities, compared to about one-third of U.S. companies.It may not be long before London replaces New York as the capital of PR. Why is America lagging behind in the global PR race? Firstly, Americans as a whole tend to be fairly provincial and take more of an interest in local affairs. Knowledge of world geography, for example, has never been strong in this country. Secondly, Americans lag behind their European and Asian counterparts in knowing a second language. Less than 5 percent of Burson--Marshall's U.S.employees know two languages. Ogilvy and Mather have about the same percentage. Conversely, some European firms have half or more of their employees fluent in a second language. Finally, people involved in PR abroad tend to keep a closer eye on international affairs. In the financial PR area, for instance, most Americans read the Wall Street Journal. Overseas, their counterparts read the Journal as well as the Financial Times of London and The Economist, publications not often read in this country. Perhaps the PR industry might take a lesson from Ted Turner of CNN (Cable News Network). Turner recently announced that the word \\"foreign\\" would no longer be used on CNN news broadcasts. According to Turner, global communications have made the nations of the world so interdependent that there is no longer any such thing as foreign. It could be inferred that the author of the passage is _ . A) an American B) a Briton C) Ted Turner D) an Asian A:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the given information: - The passage discusses the rise of global PR and mentions that America's influence in public relations is being threatened. - The passage states that Americans are lagging behind in global PR due to reasons such as being more focused on local affairs, not knowing a second language, and not keeping an eye on international affairs. - The passage doesn't provide any personal opinion or indication of the author's nationality directly. Given this information, it is not possible to accurately determine the author's nationality. However, the passage seems to be written from an American perspective, mentioning the issues that Americans face in PR, so the best inference would be: A) an American"},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to count the number of vowels (letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') / consonants (all letters other than vowels) in the given sentence.

Step 2: Introduce the movie and give a brief overview \\"The Imminent Fall\\" is a sci-fi thriller directed by John Doe Jones and starring famous actor, Tom Timbleton, as the lead character, Jake Walters. The movie follows Jake's attempts to save the world from an impending disaster, as he uncovers an international conspiracy. Step 3: List and analyze negative aspects of the movie Starting with the plot, \\"The Imminent Fall\\" suffers from a clichéd and predictable storyline. Despite its promising premise, it fails to deliver any surprises or originality. The movie seems to rely solely on the popularity of its leading actor and high-budget special effects, rather than exploring the unique concept of its plot. The character development is also lacking, leaving the audience with cardboard cutouts whose motivations remain vague and unrelatable. Tom Timbleton, usually a phenomenal actor, is wasted in a poorly written role. His character, Jake Walters, is often seen making questionable decisions, which the audience can hardly justify. Moreover, the weak supporting cast adds nothing of value to the story. The dialogue is another area where \\"The Imminent Fall\\" painfully disappoints. Most lines sound forced and unrealistic, further distancing the audience from feeling any connection or empathy towards the characters. This issue is compounded by the film's jarring pacing. Important moments are glossed over in favor of long, incoherent action sequences, leading to a disjointed viewing experience. Step 4: Strong concluding paragraph In conclusion, \\"The Imminent Fall\\" is a disappointing movie that squanders its potential with poor writing, lackluster character development, and unconvincing dialogue. Moviegoers expecting an entertaining experience will leave the theater feeling underwhelmed and unsatisfied. It's a disservice to its talented lead actor, Tom Timbleton, and a stark reminder that big budgets and special effects cannot make up for a lack of depth and substance in storytelling."},{"instruction":"Write a title for this article: Tuesday, September 21st 2010, 4:00 AM The Bronx congregation that lost its bishop along with the bishop's wife and four other members in an out-of-town traffic accident was consoled last night by one person who can fully understand its loss. David Wright's church in Brooklyn lost its own spiritual leader and the leader's wife in an out-of-town accident two years ago. His grief was all the more searing because the victims were also his father and mother. The third fatality was his 14-year-old nephew. \\"I know what those people are feeling right now,\\" Wright said before his visit. One marked difference between the two tragedies was that the Rev. Timothy Wright of the Grace Tabernacle Christian Center initially survived after a drunken driver drove into his car, killing his wife and grandson. The elder Wright was paralyzed, and among those who reached out to offer comfort and counsel was the family of the late actor Christopher Reeve, who had been consigned to a wheelchair by a horse-riding accident. \\"He used to be Superman,\\" David Wright noted. The son would not forget the super strength the Reeve family gave him and his family over the nine months before the elder Wright succumbed to his injures. \\"To have somebody step forward who knows. ...\\" David Wright said. After hearing of last week's tragedy at the Joy Fellowship Christian Assemblies, Wright resolved to bring them the comfort of somebody who knows. \\"It brought back memories of my mom and my dad's accident,\\" he said Monday. He also would be going as his father's 32-year-old successor as pastor of their Brooklyn church. The Rev. David Wright was heartened to see news reports of a service at the Bronx church. The faithful there were still able to praise and even thank the Almighty. \\"That's exactly what they need to do now,\\" he said. \\"That's the same thing that got us through. Their faith in God is what's going to get them through.\\" He knows all too well that keeping your faith can become a struggle when you are struck by ungodly tragedy. \\"Why do bad things happen to good people? That's the big question,\\" he said. \\"My mom and my dad, they never did any wrong to anybody.\\" The same is being said about Bishop Simon White and his wife, Zelda White, in the Bronx. The big question looms as large there as it did in Brooklyn. Yet heartbreak and hardship are what gave rise to faith in the first place, what have kept it going even while presenting it with a perpetual challenge. \\"If everything was peachy cream every day, there would be no need for faith,\\" Wright said. \\"When you go through hard times is when you need faith.\\" Without it, hard times just get even harder. \\"If you lose your faith, it just destroys you in the inside,\\" Wright said. \\"As long as you keep your faith, you know you'll be okay.\\" Wright was traveling from his church to the Bronx to offer proof that faith can indeed prevail. His father's Grammy-nominated choir is about to release a new CD. The Grace Tabernacle itself is thriving. The older members are adjusting to having the son as a pastor after two decades with the father. \\"It took a little bit of getting used to,\\" Wright said. \\"You actually watched your pastor grow up. People that used to baby-sit me, now I'm leading them spiritually.\\" He hoped his presence at Monday night's prayer meeting would bring the congregation hope. \\"Just let them know there is somebody there that went through that,\\" he said. \\"If I got through it, then they can.\\" When his turn came to speak, his words were as simple as his message. \\"God never says 'Oops,'\\" he told the packed church. \\"God would not have allowed this to happen if we could not handle it.\\" Title:","output":"United by Faith: Spiritual Leaders' Families Offer Comfort and Hope Amid Tragedy"},{"instruction":"Select from the following.

One was in which the planets differed was that the first one (Planet X) had 10% more mass than the other (Planet Z). If a particular boulder weighs 800 pounds on Planet X, then it will weigh _____ on planet Z. (A) less (B) more Answer:","output":"Let's break down the problem step-by-step: 1. Identify the given information: Planet X has 10% more mass than Planet Z. A boulder weighs 800 pounds on Planet X. 2. Identify the unknown: The weight of the boulder on Planet Z. 3. Use the given information to find a relationship between the two planets: If the boulder weighs 800 pounds on Planet X, this means that the weight on the boulder is influenced by the mass of the planet. As we know that mass influences gravity, we can assume that the greater mass of Planet X generates more gravity than planet Z. 4. Establish a connection between the mass and weight: Since Planet X has 10% more mass than Planet Z, it can be inferred that the gravity on Planet X is also more than on Planet Z due to the greater mass. 5. Calculate the weight of the boulder on Planet Z: If the mass of Planet Z is 10% less than Planet X, we can calculate the effect on the boulder's weight by reducing the weight on Planet X by 10%. To do this, multiply the weight on Planet X by (1 - 0.10) or 0.90. Weight on Planet Z = 800 pounds * 0.90 = 720 pounds 6. Compare the weights: The boulder weighs 800 pounds on Planet X and 720 pounds on Planet Z. 7. Conclude the answer: Since the boulder weighs less on Planet Z, the correct answer for the test is (A) less."},{"instruction":"Lizzy: At Rainbow Preschool, there are 80 students. 25% of them are half-day students and get picked up at noon, while the rest are full-day students.

Step 1: First, let's find the number of half-day students. We know that 25% of the students are half-day students. Step 2: To calculate the number of half-day students, multiply the total number of students by the percentage of half-day students: Number of half-day students = (Total number of students) x (Percentage of half-day students) Number of half-day students = 80 x (25%) Step 3: Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 25% = 25 / 100 = 0.25 Step 4: Now, multiply the total number of students by the decimal: Number of half-day students = 80 x 0.25 = 20 So, there are 20 half-day students at Rainbow Preschool. Step 5: Now, to find the number of full-day students, subtract the number of half-day students from the total number of students: Number of full-day students = Total number of students - Number of half-day students Number of full-day students = 80 - 20 = 60 Therefore, there are 60 full-day students at Rainbow Preschool."},{"instruction":"Question: Mr. Gregory Gale is one of the few people in England who are 100 years old.

It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats.

Under pressure from the mayor, Brigadier-General Treillard (Robert Stephens) sends a member of his staff, Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert (Keith Carradine) of the 3rd Hussars, to put Feraud under house arrest. As the arrest takes place in the house of Madame de Lionne (Jenny Runacre), a prominent local lady, Feraud takes it as a personal insult from d'Hubert. Matters are made worse when Feraud asks d'Hubert if he would \\"let them spit on Napoleon\\" and d'Hubert doesn't immediately reply. Upon reaching his quarters, Feraud challenges d'Hubert to a duel. The duel is inconclusive; d'Hubert slashes Feraud's forearm but is unable to finish him off, because he is attacked by Feraud's mistress. As a result of his part in the duel, d'Hubert is dismissed from the General's staff and returned to active duty with his unit. The war interrupts the men's quarrel and they do not meet again until six months later in Augsburg in 1801. Feraud immediately challenges d'Hubert to another duel and seriously wounds him. Recovering, d'Hubert takes lessons from a fencing master and in the next duel (held in a cellar with heavy sabres), the two men fight each other to a bloody standstill. Soon afterwards, d'Hubert is relieved to learn he has been promoted to captain. Military discipline forbids officers of different ranks from duelling. The action moves to 1806 when d'Hubert is serving in LÃ¼beck. He is shocked to hear that the 7th Hussars have arrived in the city and that Feraud is now also a captain. Aware that in two weeks time he is to be promoted to major, d'Hubert attempts to slip away but is spotted by Feraud's perpetual second. Feraud challenges him to another duel, which is to be fought on horseback with sabres.

It's like a saloon inside, with red velvet and beveled glass. It's got miles of wood paneling. Hell, there may still be a stash in that wood paneling that's worth 36 grand! Via the Village Voice, some dude on Craigslist in East Texas wants to sell his bus, which was built for the red-headed stranger in the '80s. Interior by Florida Coach, and lots of marijuana. It could be converted into, like, an Uber for working class heroes: If you're interested, the damn thing runs just fine, thank you very much. But act fast: Due to the extremely high demand and the amount of offers being thrown at us for this bus. We have decided to take offers all the way to 12:00 AM Central 5/3/2014 for this bus. We are planning to sell this bus this weekend. Also, no checks or loans, man: \\"Cash is the preferred method of payment.\\" ||||| The beaut above is a 1983 Eagle that gets an eco-friendly seven miles per gallon when the generator is running. It's got crushed velvet curtains, and -- just a guess here -- a few dozen places to hide your weed. Because, oh yeah, it's Willie Nelson's old tour bus, and it's hard to look at without daydreaming about living a life on the open road in all the glorious comfort she no-doubt offers. If you want it, you should act now, because the guy behind the ad says his phone hasn't stopped ringing since he listed it on easttexas.craigslist.com Sunday night. \\"It's been non-stop,\\" he says. \\"I've gotten calls from as far as Washington state and New York,\\" he told us when we called him ourselves. His name is Alan. He was very polite (naturally -- Texas). Here's the story he gave us about this treasure. [UPDATE: The bid for the bus is up to 36,000, and the seller will field offers until 12 a.m. Central, 5/3/2014. \\"We are planning to sell this bus this weekend.\\"] [UPDATE II: The bus ultimately sold for a whopping 86,000. Alan works in IT and listed the bus for an older friend who isn't quite so tech savvy. That friend does lots of business in and around Texas and its neighboring states, and so when he was tipped off to something rumored to be Willie Nelson's old tour bus being sold in Alabama, he checked it out. He bought it \\"three or four\\" years ago, and has used it frequently ever since. He's \\"giving up the hobby\\" and is ready to unload it. He owns \\"several other vehicles\\" according to Alan. Alan says the frequent calls he's fielding from curious buyers are 75-percent serious cash-in-hand offers. Some, like us, just have questions. The bus is one of two identical custom-made for Willie, and it had three owners before the fella Alan is selling it for got hold of it. The interior is in excellent condition (as you can see below) and the only problem with the exterior is a couple spots of peeling clear coat. The generator was serviced three years ago and electrical in the bus has been well maintained over the years. Alan says, based on the volume of calls, they probably priced Willie's bus too low. They have no plans to raise the price now, though, because sometimes people aren't terrible. It'll stay at 29,999, a figure they arrived at by comparing it to other buses of the same make and year already on the market. \\"The owner doesn't really need the money,\\" says Alan. Enough talk.

On the other hand, the scenario mentioned about less fault lines rubbing against rocks refers to tectonic activity, which is unrelated to the respiratory system or the delivery of oxygen to the body by biological processes. However, to provide a comprehensive answer, let's consider if there could be an indirect relationship between these two phenomena. Fault lines rubbing against rocks are associated with earthquakes and other seismic activities. If there is a decrease in this tectonic activity, it may lead to fewer disturbances to the Earth's crust and surface features. Though this may not have a direct impact on oxygen delivery, it can indirectly affect the environmental conditions and air quality. One possible scenario is that with less tectonic activity, there might be fewer volcanic eruptions and other geological events that could release dust or ash particles into the atmosphere. This could potentially lead to cleaner air, which might make it easier for a person to breathe in oxygen, thereby improving the respiratory system's efficiency. In this particular case, the reduction in fault line movement could have a subtle 'more' effect on the amount of oxygen that is delivered to the system due to the indirect impact on air quality. As for the second effect mentioned, which involves the cells in the body exchanging oxygen with carbon dioxide, there may also be an indirect 'more' effect. Since cleaner air makes it easier for a person to breathe in oxygen, there could be a more substantial exchange between oxygen and carbon dioxide on a cellular level. This would lead to more effective oxygenation and the removal of waste products from the body's cells. In summary, although there is no direct connection between fault line movement and the respiratory process, a reduction in fault line movements could potentially result in cleaner air, which might have an indirect 'more' effect on both oxygen delivery to the body and the exchange of oxygen with carbon dioxide within the body's cells."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given triplets.

Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an overachieving junior with an insufferable air of self-importance. Earlier in the year, another teacher, Jim's best friend Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik) was fired from his job and divorced by his wife, Linda (Delaney Driscoll) after it came out that he and Tracy were having a sexual affair, while Tracy's reputation was unscathed. Against this backdrop, Tracy announces that she is running for student council president. Initially she is unopposed, as she is widely seen as the natural candidate for the job. When Tracy presents Mr. McAllister with her list of nominating signatures to qualify for the election ballot, she makes a remark about \\"working closely\\" together that he interprets as an indication she may try to seduce him. Perhaps annoyed by Tracy's presumptuousness, and/or concerned that he might give in to this seduction and share the same fate as his friend Dave, Mr. McAllister decides to persuade junior Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), a slow-witted, but affable and popular football player to enter the race. Paul is unable to play football as he is recovering from a ski injury that resulted in his left leg being broken, and Mr. McAllister suggests a new way to explore his talents through student council. Although Paul is ambivalent at first, he agrees to run, much to Tracy's consternation.

During the period 1558-1578, Russia dominated the region with early military successes at Dorpat and Narva. Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland-Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and Frederick II of Denmark bought the old Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek, which he placed under the control of his brother Magnus of Holstein. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian vassal state Kingdom of Livonia, which nominally existed until his defection in 1576. In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish-Polish-Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland-Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland-Lithuania.

There are many differences between having a freshwater aquarium versus having a saltwater aquarium. These differences include how you initially set up the aquarium and all ongoing care, maintenance, everyday chores, and costs requirements. There are several key issues you will need to consider while you choose: Saltwater aquariums cost more. Saltwater aquariums have specific water requirements that need extra tools and equipment to maintain it, as opposed to maintaining a freshwater aquarium. For example, most saltwater aquariums need protein skimmers or a foam fractionator in addition to the regular filter system that all aquariums need. Unlike a regular aquarium filter, protein skimmers completely remove dissolved organics from the water which is vitally important for saltwater aquariums where a buildup of nitrates can be deadly. Water changes are easier for freshwater tanks. All aquariums need weekly or bi-weekly partial water changes. For freshwater aquariums, simply doing a 10% to 20% water change with an aquarium vacuum and refilling the tank with dechlorinated tap or filtered water is enough. However, saltwater aquariums will require you to mix new saltwater days before your scheduled partial water change. There are more saltwater invertebrates and fish to choose from. In terms of aesthetic and choice, there are more options available if you are choosing to have a saltwater aquarium. You can find stunning saltwater fish like angelfish, clownfish, and lionfish and a vast array of invertebrates available like starfish, shrimps, worms, and corals. Saltwater fish may need special diets. In most cases, getting freshwater fish to eat flakes is not a problem. However, if you choose saltwater fish, especially those that need to be caught from the wild, they may need special diets or be weaned into eating conventional fish flakes and food. Giving fish an inadequate diet can lower their immune systems and cause diseases, which can eventually lead to death. A small fish tank set up is generally more economical than a large fish tank. There are several issues you should consider when choosing the size of your tank: Where will you put your aquarium? The best place to put a fish tank is away from direct sunlight and heater vents. Fluctuations in temperature and sunlight can cause green algae to form and dirty the water quality of your tank. In some cases, the best location for an aquarium can restrict the size of your tank. Your aquarium stand should be able to withhold the weight of the tank. For each gallon (4 litres) of water, there is approximately 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of weight. Obviously, smaller tank would hold less weight than a larger one. It’s harder to maintain the quality of water in a small fish tank. This means you will need to do more partial water changes than if you had a large fish tank. The size of your tank will determine what type of fish you can have. Most fish require at least 5 gallons (20 litres) of water with the exception of betta fish that don’t need as much water. However, being able to survive in a certain condition doesn’t necessarily mean the fish is thriving or living a happy life. There are three main saltwater aquarium types: Fish Only, Fish Only with Live Rock (FOWLR), and the Reef Tank. Fish Only Tanks: As the name suggests, this tank only houses saltwater fish. It is the least expensive way to set up a saltwater aquarium. However, it does have its disadvantages. Fish Only tanks take longer to set up, require more frequent tank maintenance and testing, and have a shorter shelf life than the other types of saltwater aquariums. Fish Only with Live Rock: FOWLR tanks are set up like Fish Only tanks but with the addition of live rock and better aquarium lighting. The live rock acts as a natural biological filter for saltwater and keeps your tank healthier than a Fish Only tank. A live rock has hundreds of tiny creatures and biological organisms living inside and on the surface of the rock. Reef Tank: If you choose this type of saltwater aquarium, you are most likely looking towards having invertebrates, corals, or anemones as the main focus of your aquarium and fish are just an afterthought. Reef tanks require daily water quality checks, high lighting levels, extra water supplements, heavy duty filtration systems and are generally the most expensive to maintain. Reef Tanks are recommended for more experienced aquarium hobbyists. The kind of lighting and the temperature of your aquarium depend on what kind of aquarium you have and who your tank inhabitants are. The type of light you choose also affects the overall temperature of your tank. Aquariums that are Fish Only: This means your freshwater tank will not have real or live plants in it. In this case, you will most likely be using fluorescent lights that are between 18 and 40 watts. Freshwater aquariums with plants: The type of lighting you’ll need will depend on the depth of your tank, the plant species you have, and the desired growth rate of the plant. Usually, you should provide 2 to 5 watts of light per gallon in a planted freshwater aquarium. Always research and consult with your aquarium expert when you plan to have plants in your tank. Saltwater Reef Tanks: These tanks need high levels of light that are characteristic of high output fluorescent and metal halide lamps. Some corals may even need more intense levels of light that can be achieved with T5-HO, Very High Output (VHO), and metal halide lights. All filters have three functions to them, which include mechanically filtering the water by trapping or removing free floating particles, biologically filtering the water by growing good bacteria, and chemically filtering the water by dissolving wastes. There are various types of filter: Mechanical Filter: The most popular type of filter is the corner filter that recycles water through the three-filtration stages. It usually sits at the top of the aquarium in the middle or in the corner and sucks up water through a tube and spits it out again. Undergravel Filter: This filter provides good mechanical filtration since it is located underneath the gravel in plates, which forces the water to filter through the rocks, trapping and taking any fallen particles in the water. Canister Filter: This high end filtration system operates by having multiple trays that mechanically, biologically, and chemically filter the water. It filters the water by pushing water from the bottom of the canister to the top. Protein Skimmer: This filter is necessary if you have a saltwater aquarium. Protein skimmers remove dissolved organic materials from the water as opposed to other filtration systems that only trap it until you change the filter.

One night they are intrigued by a young man who bursts into the brothel and is immediately tended to after snapping his fingers, despite the brothelkeeper's objections. The gentlemen are informed that he is Courtley, who was disinherited for celebrating a Black Mass. Hoping for more intense pleasures, Hargood meets Courtley outside the brothel. The younger man takes the three to the Cafe Royal and promises them experiences they will never forget but insists that they go to see Weller and purchase from him Dracula's ring, cloak and dried blood. Having done so, the three meet with Courtley at an abandoned Church for a ceremony during which he puts the dried blood into goblets and mixes it with drops of his own blood, telling the men to drink. They refuse, so he drinks the blood himself, screams and falls to the ground. As he grabs their legs, they kick and beat him, not stopping until Courtley dies, at which they flee. While the three return to their respective homes and return to their lives, Courtley's body, left in the abandoned church, transforms into Dracula, who vows that those who have destroyed his servant will be destroyed.

Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest “I was crying. I had tears coming out of my eyes,” Davis said in an exclusive interview with ABC News. “I'm just a nobody, so it was really humbling to think he would want to meet or know me.” Davis, who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, says the private meeting occurred during the pope’s historic trip to the United States. After receiving a surprise phone call from a church official, the Kentucky county clerk says she traveled to Washington, D.C., where she and her husband Joe met the pope Sept. 24 at the Vatican Embassy. “I put my hand out and he reached and he grabbed it, and I hugged him and he hugged me,” Davis said. “And he said, ‘thank you for your courage.’” Father Benedettini from the Vatican Press office released a statement after reports emerged that Davis and the pope had met. “The Holy See is aware of the reports of Kim Davis meeting with the Holy Father. The Vatican does not confirm the meeting, nor does it deny the meeting. There will be no further information given,“ the statement reads. Hours later, Father Benedettini said, in another statement, “I do not deny that the meeting took place, but I will not comment on it further.\\" The Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, D.C. would also not elaborate, echoing the Vatican's latest statement. Liberty Counsel Davis drew national attention -– and spent six days in jail -– after refusing a judge's order to issue marriage licenses in Rowan County, Kentucky, to same-sex and heterosexual couples, citing her religious beliefs. Davis, back at work, is still not issuing any marriage licenses. ABC News' Terry Moran asked Francis Sunday night if he supports individuals, including government officials, who claim religious liberty as a reason to disobey the law. Francis responded, \\"I can't have in mind all the cases that can exist about conscientious objection, but, yes, I can say that conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right. It is a right. And if a person does not allow others to be a conscientious objector, he denies a right.\\" When asked if that includes government officials, Francis said, \\"It is a human right and if a government official is a human person, he has that right.

Just knowing that the pope is on track with what we're doing, it kind of validates everything to have someone of that stature,” Davis said. Davis says she’s committed to her cause, even if it means more time behind bars. “I've weighed the cost and I'm prepared to do whatever it takes, even jail,” she said. “It's still the same battle, we just have some more fighting with us now.” ||||| Sep 29, 2015 Washington, DC – Media is buzzing about the Pope’s comments in support of conscientious objection and whether he knows about the Rowan County, Kentucky, Clerk of Court who was jailed for six days for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses. The Pope met privately with Kim Davis and her husband, Joe, at the Vatican Embassy in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, September 24, which was the birthday of Kim’s father. Pope Francis spoke with Kim and Joe Davis in English. During the meeting Pope Francis said, \\"Thank you for your courage.\\" Pope Francis also told Kim Davis, \\"Stay strong. He held out his hands and asked Kim to pray for him. Kim held his hands and said, \\"I will. Please pray for me,\\" and the Pope said he would. The two embraced. The Pontiff presented Kim and Joe Davis each with a Rosary that he personally blessed. Kim's mother and father are Catholic, and Kim and Joe will present the Rosaries to her parents. Kim's mother was the elected Clerk of Court for Rowan County for 37 years until her retirement in 2014. Kim Davis said, \\"I was humbled to meet Pope Francis. Of all people, why me?\\" Davis continued, \\"I never thought I would meet the Pope. Who am I to have this rare opportunity? I am just a County Clerk who loves Jesus and desires with all my heart to serve him.\\" Kim said, \\"Pope Francis was kind, genuinely caring, and very personable. He even asked me to pray for him. Pope Francis thanked me for my courage and told me to 'stay strong.'\\" \\"The challenges we face in America regarding the sanctity of human life, marriage, and religious freedom are the same universal challenges Christians face around the world. Religious freedom is a human right that comes from God. These values are shared in common by people of faith, and the threats to religious freedom are universal. Kim Davis has become a symbol of this worldwide conflict between Christian faith and recent cultural challenges regarding marriage,\\" said Mat Staver, Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel. Speaking with reporters on board the Papal plane to Rome, Pope Francis told Terry Moran of ABC News that conscientious objection is a human right, even for government officials: \\"Conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right. It is a right. And if a person does not allow others to be a conscientious objector, he denies a right. Conscientious objection must enter into every juridical structure because it is a right, a human right. Otherwise we would end up in a situation where we select what is a right, saying 'this right that has merit, this one does not.' It (conscientious objection) is a human right. It always moved me when I read, and I read it many times, when I read the \\"Chanson de Roland\\" when the people were all in line and before them was the baptismal font and they had to choose between the baptismal font or the sword. They had to choose. They weren't permitted conscientious objection. It is a right and if we want to make peace we have to respect all rights.\\" The ABC News Chief Foreign Correspondent asked if that includes government officials as well, and the Pope reiterated that conscientious objection is a human right: \\"It is a human right and if a government official is a human person, he has that right,\\" Pope Francis affirmed. After the above statement of Pope Francis was published, some in the media wondered if the Pontiff knew of Kim Davis. \\"Not only did Pope Francis know of Kim Davis, he personally met with her to express his support,\\" concluded Staver.

The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers.

They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour.

Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him. At the end of the lesson Jody was packing her stuff up and didn't know what to do with the bottle of white-out, so she tossed it out the window of the classroom. Dara had seen her do it, and thought it was just so cool. Jody had done it not in the hope of getting attention, because no one was paying attention, they were all packing up their own crap as fast as possible; she'd just done it.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"These two questions are inquiring about intelligence quotient (IQ) scores, specifically scores of 191 and 127, but they are not asking for the same information. Let's examine each question separately to understand what these IQ scores mean. Step 1: Understanding IQ IQ is a numerical measure that aims to assess human intelligence. The scores represent an individual's cognitive abilities compared to the average intelligence of the general population. The average IQ is usually set at 100, with a standard deviation of 15. Step 2: Interpreting the IQ scores Question 1: What does it mean if a person has an IQ of 191? An IQ of 191 is considered exceptionally rare and significantly higher than the average score of 100. It is in the \\"genius\\" or \\"near genius\\" range and represents a level of intelligence that is among the top 0.01% of the population. Question 2: What does it mean if a person has an IQ of 127? An IQ of 127 is above the average score of 100. It is considered to be in the \\"superior intelligence\\" range, which falls around the top 5% of the population. Individuals with this score are likely to have above-average cognitive abilities in problem-solving, logical reasoning, and abstract thinking. In conclusion, both questions are inquiring about the meaning of specific IQ scores, but they are not asking for the same information as the scores have different levels of intelligence. They compare an individual's cognitive abilities to the average cognitive abilities of the general population."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: Who is the can-can girl's sister?

Article: You might think I'd have little in common with a camel, but we do share one useful skill: both of us can go for a very long time without water. Usually I start my day with a cup of tea, and then I might have a glass of water with my lunch and one with dinner, that's about a liter of liquid in 24 hours. It feels like plenty, but apparently it's not nearly enough. After years of suffering headaches and poor digestion I spoke to a neurologist about my regular headaches and a nutritionist about my poor digestion, and both told me I should be drinking up to three liters of liquid a day for my body to function at its best. I decided to conduct an experiment. What would happen if I drank the recommended amount every day for a month? The photograph of me taken the day I started this trial demonstrates perfectly and rather frighteningly what a lack of hydration does to a face. I am 42, but have to admit I look more like 52 in this picture, which is shocking. There are dark shadows under and around my eyes, which make me look exhausted, a profusion of wrinkles and strange reddish blotches, and my skin lacks any luster . It looks dead. Even my lips look shriveled . This is all classic evidence of poor hydration, apparently. Every system and function in our body depends on water. It flushes toxins from the vital organs, carries nutrients to cells, provides a moist environment for ear, nose and throat tissues, and eliminates waste. Not drinking enough means all these functions becomes damaged. So I decided to see how I would look and feel if I drank three liters of water every day for 28 days. The results were astonishing.

A Chinese version of Mars One, a Dutch program to send people to Mars, blossomed in my mind. They could call it “Huoxing yi,” or Fire Star One, with Mars translating into Chinese as “fire star.” It would be a select group of second graders, future breeders in white jumpsuits, taking off from the Chinese desert in a Shenzhou, or Divine Land, spacecraft, abandoning their exhausted planet to build a new civilization as Earth slides into an abyss of climate change. China has a pretty good space program, after all. Yet we had been called in to hear about the school’s music band, not a mission to Mars. So what was Teacher Wang talking about? Eugenics for music, it turns out. Teacher Wang proceeded to describe a program by which a group of 8-year-olds, selected purely on the basis of physical characteristics rather than interest, would build the best band in the world that would travel overseas and wow audiences with the flower of Chinese youth. Freaky enough, without a one-way ticket to Mars. “For the best band, we’ve chosen the best students and the best teachers,” Teacher Wang continued. Mr. Wang, whom parents addressed only as “Teacher,” (a sign of respect common here) stood before a giant white screen on which he projected a power point full of instrument images. “I’ve chosen your kids, one by one, out of a thousand kids.” Mr. Wang was referring to band C, the third in the school which trained the youngest students, some of whom would eventually rise through the ranks to band B and on to A, at which point they would perform at overseas gigs. “I’ve looked at their teeth, at their arms, their height, everything, very carefully,” Teacher Wang said. “We don’t want anyone with asthma, or heart problems, or eye problems. And we want the smart kids; the quick learners.” “Your kids were chosen not because they want to play this or that instrument, but because they have long arms, or the right lips, or are the right height, say for the trumpet, or the drums,” he said. Seated across from me at a school desk, a father in China’s blue Public Security Uniform with silver-and-black insignia on his shoulder appeared to be listening carefully. Yet as he fiddled with a pen, took notes, leaned forward with his elbows on the desk, stared down, crossed his legs at the ankles, I wondered if he was entirely “there.” Chinese police attend a lot of ideological meetings at which matters such as the rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation or control of ethnic minorities are freely discussed. Likely he was proud his child had been selected for Band C. But perhaps he was also a bit bored, I thought. I, however, was spellbound. During my years in China I’d learned about ideas on a person’s “quality,” or “suzhi,” — concepts that are widely accepted here but would probably discomfort liberal parents elsewhere. At our school, the children are separated into two sections — a so-called “international department” and a “Chinese department” — depending on their citizenship. Though both sections use similar Chinese-language teaching materials, they are treated differently and rarely mingle. The majority of students in the international department are of Chinese origin too, but have with overseas passports. The international department is more laid-back than the Chinese department which, according to my daughter, gets fewer breaks, more homework and is subject to harsher discipline. For the purposes of the school band, however, the two groups were one. Two other non-Chinese, 8-year-old friends of my daughter were among the chosen. The Italian mother of one said her daughter had been chosen for saxophone because the girl was strongly built. “The other girl playing the sax is a Russian, and she’s also pretty built up and strong,” said my friend. (I have omitted their names out of respect for their privacy and that of their children.) My friend recalled that some of the parents had asked Teacher Wang why he was choosing children in grade 2 now, rather than earlier when they were in grade 1. Teacher Wang’s reply: “Because in grade 1 their teeth are falling out,” she said. My friend said that Teacher Wang had personally inspected each child’s teeth, as if, she said, “they were horses in the market.” There was discussion of what kind of lips worked best for the trumpet. And in a statement that shocked both of us profoundly, Teacher Wang said something about how Africans had long arms and so would be good at particular instruments, such as the cello. The American father of the third girl said a dentist had visited the school to see which students’ teeth were best suited to play wind instruments. His daughter, braces-free, passed and is learning to play the clarinet. My daughter, who has some wonky teeth and braces, is a drummer. Apart from the teeth, I can see why; she has the mad energy of Animal in The Muppets and loves what the Chinese call “renao,” or “hot noise,” excitement. As a parent who found the eugenics of it disturbing, what was Ito do? Everyone, including the parents of “long-armed” children, seemed O.K. with it. My daughter was pushing hard to be part of it. I gave in. And she loves it. Summary:","output":"In China, a school band music program selects students based on their physical attributes, such as the length of their arms, the shape of their lips, and their height, instead of their musical interest or talent. The teacher behind this program, Teacher Wang, believes such physical characteristics can determine who may excel at playing different musical instruments. He also excludes students with certain health conditions like asthma or heart problems. This method of selection is somewhat similar to eugenics, which is a belief in improving human species by selective breeding based on desirable traits. While this may seem unusual to some, it is generally accepted in this Chinese school community."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

President Snow visits Katniss at her home. The two make an agreement to not lie to one another, and Snow explains that her actions in the Games have inspired rebellions across the districts. He orders her to use the upcoming victory tour to convince him that her actions were out of genuine love for Peeta, not defiance against the Capitol, otherwise Katniss's loved ones will be killed. He shows her the clip where Gale kisses her as a warning that they are watching her. As the tour begins, Haymitch Abernathy, Katniss and Peeta's mentor, warns them that the \\"show\\" of their relationship must continue for the rest of their lives. Katniss suggests a public engagement between herself and Peeta, which is carried out and approved by Snow at his mansion in the Capitol. Returning home, Katniss warns her friend Gale Hawthorne of Snow's threat to kill both their families. Peacekeepers crack down on District 12, and Gale is publicly whipped after attacking new Head Peacekeeper Romulus Thread. Snow announces that the upcoming 75th Hunger Games, the Third Quarter Quell, will feature tributes selected from previous victors. Katniss immediately devotes herself to ensuring Peeta's survival, and recruits Haymitch's help to do so. At the reaping, Effie Trinket draws Katniss and Haymitch's names, but Peeta immediately volunteers to take Haymitch's place. As they prepare, Haymitch reveals that all the tributes are angry about being returned to the Games and advises a reluctant Katniss to make allies. In the pre-Games interviews, Katniss wears a wedding dress, as ordered by President Snow, but her stylist Cinna rigs it to transform into a representation of a mockingjay. Peeta announces that he and Katniss have secretly married and are expecting a baby, which causes outrage, and the audience of Capitol citizens begins shouting for the Games to be stopped, to no avail.

Choose your answer from: * spray the top of the stick with oil to absorb some of the heat.; * place a coozie over the top of the stick when driving the car.;","output":"To accomplish the goal of preventing your hand from getting burned when driving an automatic car on a hot day, I would recommend a slightly modified version of the second option: placing a protective cover over the top of the gear stick when the car is parked, rather than while driving. In addition, there are several other precautionary measures you can take. The first option, spraying the top of the stick with oil, is not advisable. Oil may indeed absorb some of the heat, but it can also make the gear stick slippery and difficult to hold, potentially compromising your control of the vehicle. Moreover, oil could damage the gear stick or the surrounding interior of the car. As for placing a coozie over the top of the stick, this can be a useful strategy, but I suggest you modify it slightly. Instead, place a protective cover (such as a coozie or a small towel) over the gear stick when the car is parked under the sun. This will prevent the gear stick from becoming too hot to handle once you get back in the car. Apart from the above, here are some additional tips to keep your gear stick cool and avoid burning your hand: 1. Park in the shade: Whenever possible, park your car in a shaded area to minimize direct sunlight exposure and to keep the interior cool. 2. Use a sunshade: Invest in a car sunshade for your windshield to reflect sunlight and reduce the temperature inside your vehicle. 3. Ventilate your car: Before getting into the car on a hot day, open the doors and windows for a minute or two to let the hot air escape. This will cool down the interior, including the gear stick. 4. Use a steering wheel cover: A steering wheel cover made of insulating material will not only keep the steering wheel cool but also the surrounding components, like the gear stick. 5. Air conditioning: Once you start the car, turn on the air conditioning and let it run for a few minutes before driving. This will cool the inside of the car, making it more comfortable to drive and protecting your hand from burns. 6. Avoid driving during peak heat hours: If possible, avoid driving during the hottest hours of the day to minimize the risk of burns. 7. Insulated gear stick cover: You can purchase an insulated gear stick cover specifically designed to keep it cool on hot days. In conclusion, the best way to prevent getting your hand burned when driving an automatic car on a hot day is by parking in the shade, using sunshades and protective covers, ventilating the car, and utilizing various techniques to keep the car's interior cool. Placing a coozie or a small towel over the gear stick when parked is also a practical approach, rather than while driving. By taking these steps, you can ensure a comfortable driving experience on hot days."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task you will be given some text dialogue and you need to infer the underlying emotion of the text.

A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds 55% hold a positive view of the pope, compared to just 7% who hold a negative view. About a quarter of Americans didn’t have an opinion. His popularity has held steady in recent months, but has skyrocketed since last July, when 35% said they viewed the pope positively. Pope Francis has fared far better than his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who had a 30% approval rating when he left office in February. The pope consistently ranks better among more educated Americans, with 66% of people who had received a postgraduate degree saying they viewed him positively, compared with 48% of those who had completed some or all of high school. Democrats are also fonder of the pope than Republicans or independents are. Some 62% of Democrats said they viewed Pope Francis positively, compared with 53% of Republicans and 41% of independents. Since his election, the pope has drawn significant media attention with his personal warmth and his efforts to set a new tone for the Catholic Church. Last week, a media firestorm ensued when, in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, the pope said the church must evaluate gay civil unions, though he maintained that marriage is between a man and a woman. Last September, he remarked that the church had grown “obsessed” with abortion, gay marriage and contraception and called for a “new balance” in the church. A strong majority of Catholics have also responded positively to Pope Francis, with 60% saying they agreed with the statement, “Pope Francis has renewed and strengthened my religious faith and commitment to the Catholic Church”—compared to 31% who said they disagreed. Women were far more likely than men to agree with that statement, with 70% reporting they did, compared with 50% of men. Older Catholics were also more likely to feel renewed faith than younger ones, with 61% of Catholics over the age of 61 saying they agreed with the statement, compared to 51% of Catholics aged 18 to 34.

His predecessor, Benedict XVI, had resigned the month before, citing a decline in his physical and mental strength, leading to an almost unprecedented handover of power. After the remote, intellectual German theologian came the church's first Jesuit leader, its first Latin American pontiff – and the first pope to take the name of Francis. The pope was elected with a mandate to shake up the church in Rome and help turn the page on an increasingly fraught and scandal-bedevilled papacy. His many fans argue he has vigorously pursued a reformist agenda within the Vatican while radically improving the church's image outside it. But, as Rome marks his first anniversary, just how successful has this peculiarly popular pontiff been? Good works Image management Pope Francis blesses Vinicio Riva in November. Photograph: Claudio Peri/EPA Talk of the \\"Pope Francis effect\\" is ubiquitous for a reason: since stepping out on to the balcony of St Peter's on the evening of 13 March 2013 to joke that the cardinal-electors had been forced to cast their nets to \\"the end of the Earth\\" to find a successor to Benedict, Jorge Mario Bergoglio has scarcely put a humbly shod foot wrong PR-wise. Despite adhering to church teaching as closely as his predecessor, Francis has, through a mixture of charm, humour and openness, turned many preconceptions – and prejudices – on their heads. His decision to abjure the splendour of the apostolic palace in favour of the modest Casa Santa Marta guesthouse has offered proof of his personal commitment to a humbler church, while his tender embracing of Vinicio Riva, a man terribly disfigured by tumours, underlined his hands-on pastoral approach. Such actions saw him voted person of the year by both Time magazine and the US gay and lesbian magazine The Advocate, while his Twitter account - @pontifex – has almost 3.8 million followers. Church governance Francis's decision to appoint eight \\"outsider\\" cardinals to advise him on church reform was described by one observer as the \\"most important step in the history of the church for the past 10 centuries\\". The council, which includes cardinals from the US, Australia, India, Honduras and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has inevitably been dubbed the papal G8. \\"[They are] not courtiers but wise people who share my feelings,\\" said Francis, who has often been scathing about the \\"introspective and Vatican-centric\\" nature of the Holy See. \\"This is the start of a church with not just a vertical but horizontal organisation.\\" Jesuits, who have had to wait almost 500 years to see one of their number sit on the papal throne, proudly point out that consultation is one of the foundations of their order. Overhaul of the Congregation for Bishops Pope Francis meets bishops at the end of his weekly general audience, in St Peter's Square last month. Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP As well as assembling his own G8, Francis has revamped the powerful Congregation for Bishops, the Vatican department responsible for selecting bishops. By appointing 12 new members and not confirming 14 existing members, he rebalanced the department to make it more moderate and progressive. Among those who were not confirmed was the highly influential conservative US cardinal Raymond Burke, who has been an outspoken critic of US presidential candidates who are in favour of abortion, embryonic stem-cell research, euthanasia, human cloning and same-sex marriage. New members include Vincent Nichols, the leader of Catholics in England and Wales praised for his pastoral and inclusive style, whom Francis made a cardinal last month. The papal historian Michael Walsh described the overhaul of the congregation as a \\"tectonic shift\\" in governance. Inclusivity On Maundy Thursday 2013, a fortnight after becoming pope, Francis exhorted his priests to abandon introspection and to get out \\"to the outskirts where there is suffering, bloodshed, blindness that longs for sight and prisoners in thrall to many evil masters\\". He washed and kissed the feet of two Muslims – one a woman – at a youth detention centre near Rome. It was the first time a pontiff had included women in the ceremony. For many, the greatest proof of the pope's commitment to inclusivity and his desire to appeal to those who have long felt ignored or criticised by the church came during an impromptu press conference on a flight back from Brazil in July. \\"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to judge?\\" he asked journalists. Anglican relations Francis's determination to \\"intensify dialogue among the various religions\\" has not been confined to reaching out to Jews and Muslims. Last June, he had lunch with the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the pair chatted for four hours. Despite frosty relations that have existed between the churches in recent years – caused mainly by the C of E's decision to ordain women and Pope Benedict's creation of an ordinariate to bring disaffected Anglicans into the embrace of Rome – Francis and Welby appear to have a genuine rapport. According to Sir David Moxon, the archbishop of Canterbury's representative to the Holy See and director of the Anglican centre in Rome, there was an \\"immediate chemistry\\" between the two leaders, whom Moxon describes as \\"men of action\\" equally committed to tackling poverty and social injustice. It has not hurt that Welby's personal spiritual director is a Benedictine monk; nor that the archbishop recently signalled a further rapprochement by inviting members of a Roman Catholic ecumenical community to take up residence in Lambeth Palace. Political player Pope Francis (kissing the feet of a young offender during a mass at the church of the Casal del Marmo youth prison on the outskirts of Rome in 2013. Photograph: AFP It was no accident that Francis chose a career Vatican diplomat, Pietro Parolin, as his secretary of state, a position often likened to the papal prime minister. The pope has shown a desire to put the Vatican back on the international stage as a key player in external – not just messy, internal – affairs, and his stance on Syria has been the clearest sign that under him the Catholic church's voice will be loud and clear. With an open letter to the leaders of the G20, repeated exhortations for a non-violent, mediated solution, and a day-long fast and mass prayer vigil, he provided a moral counterweight to the Obama administration and its proposed air strikes. His powerful criticisms of capitalist excesses have seen the church regain relevance in the contemporary debate on social justice. And his decision to make Lampedusa the location of his first trip outside Rome, slamming a \\"globalisation of indifference\\" that allowed migrants to die in the Mediterranean, he focused the eyes of the world on an often-overlooked problem.\\" The jury's out Curia reform The \\"outsider\\" pope was elected with a mandate to come to Rome and bang heads together. In the fading light of Benedict's papacy, infighting and corruption within the Curia – the Vatican's central bureaucracy – had dominated amid the so-called Vatileaks affair. Francis has announced measures to engender reform, most notably the creation of a secretariat of the economy – a kind of finance ministry – to centralise the handling of business and administrative affairs. That will be led by the outspoken Australian Cardinal George Pell. The other key staffing decision was to replace the widely discredited Tarcisio Bertone as secretary of state –a symbolic and practical move Francis must hope will draw a line under an era of scandal and incompetence. Core teachings The pope appearing in a selfie taken by young pilgrims in St Peter's, Rome. Photograph: AP Liberals who would like to see significant doctrinal shifts from Francis should alter their expectations. The pope has made clear his commitment to core church teachings on issues such as abortion and women's ordination. But that doesn't mean there will be no change at all. For one thing, Francis has said the church needs a \\"new balance\\" and a less condemnatory attitude to sexual morality. For another, he has shown himself to be a pragmatic conservative, committed to doctrine but concerned with how the church responds to pastoral realities. In concrete terms, speculation centres on whether he will see fit to announce a shift on the treatment of remarried divorcees, now banned from receiving holy communion. Walter Kasper, the cardinal Francis chose to speak on the subject at a consistory earlier this year, told La Repubblica newspaper this week that the church should try to find a \\"realistic application of doctrine\\", adding: \\"The church must never judge as though it had a guillotine in its hands.\\" Vatican Bank All too often the cause of embarrassment for the papacy, the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR) is at the heart of Francis's reform – and ethical finance – agenda. He has set up a commission of lay experts and clerics to investigate the bank's running, and has replaced four of five cardinals appointed under Benedict on an oversight body. Under German president Ernst von Freyberg, the bank is trying to improve transparency and has hired an outside firm of accountants to help it meet international standards. But an Italian investigation into allegations of money laundering – which the bank denies – continues and a report by a Council of Europe body, Moneyval, in December said the IOR still had some way to go. Francis has made it clear that, if the bank cannot be adequately reformed, he would have no compunction about closing it for good. Must try harder Clerical sex abuse There are growing suspicions that this, more than any other issue, is emerging as Francis's blind spot. Critics say he has done little to ramp up the church's response to the scandal. Though he has said officials must \\"act decisively\\" on the problem – and in December announced a new commission to examine ways of better protecting children and helping victims – most advocates for abuse victims say another commission is not what is needed and criticise him for not making the deep changes they, and the UN, say are necessary. They have been left despondent by Francis's occasional comments on the issue, in which he has generally defended the church while condemning the abuse. An interview published this month in which he claimed that no other institution had acted with the same \\"transparency and responsibility\\" elicited particular anger. \\"His comments about clerical sex abuse [in the interview] make it clear that he is using the same tired and irrelevant playbook the bishops have worn out over the past few years,\\" wrote priest and victims' supporter Tom Doyle in the National Catholic Reporter. ||||| Pope Francis is celebrating his first year in office. The Argentinean-born pontiff is currently on a week-long spiritual retreat with cardinals and bishops in the Alban Hills near Rome. Italian opinion polls give Pope Francis the highest popularity rating of any recent pontiff. However, the BBC's David Willey in Rome says that Francis's papacy so far has shown a change of style rather than of substance. Pope Francis is the first Latin American - and the first Jesuit - to lead the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Francis eschews the superstar status he has been accorded by the world's media Pope marks one year at Vatican Since taking office, pilgrims have been arriving in Rome in unprecedented numbers. He is also riding high on social media, with 11 million following him in nine languages on Twitter. Our correspondent says Francis's approval rating has remained high despite a recent UN report accusing the Catholic Church of systematically covering up for tens of thousands of child-abusing priests reported to the Vatican. The Pope himself has denounced any cult of personality. He recently told Corriere della Sera: \\"Portraying the pope as a kind of superman, a type of star, it seems offensive.\\" Pope Francis's reforms are not popular with some conservative Catholics Pope Francis travelled by bus to spend the first anniversary of his election in a spiritual retreat In Argentina artefacts to mark the anniversary are widely on display Italian opinion polls give Pope Francis the highest popularity rating of any recent pontiff Francis, 77, has appointed new advisers to help him run the Church and is planning major reforms of Vatican finances and of the scandal-hit Vatican bank. But our correspondent adds that for the moment there is no sign of a change in official Catholic teaching on artificial contraception or on the celibacy rule for priests. However the Pope's compassionate attitude - especially his outreach to believers who have abandoned going to Mass and to divorced Catholics banned from receiving communion - is not universally admired by traditionalist cardinals. Likewise his attitude towards gay people - he says that he is not going to judge them - contrasts strongly with that of his predecessor Pope Benedict, who called homosexuality \\"intrinsically evil\\". Thursday's anniversary is not being marked in any official way, a move that Vatican-watchers say is in keeping with the Pope's tendency to eschew pomp and ceremony. The decision to celebrate the anniversary quietly is a sound alternative to what almost certainly would have been a media frenzy if Pope Francis had decided to mark the anniversary in public, correspondents say. ||||| Religion makes a lot of mistakes. Faith traditions can be so harsh that they drive away everyone but the self-righteous scolds. Or they can so indulge in therapeutic comfort and manufactured joy that they come to seem like a charlatan’s game. E.J. Dionne writes about politics in a twice-weekly column and on the PostPartisan blog. He is also a senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution, a government professor at Georgetown University and a frequent commentator on politics for National Public Radio, ABC’s “This Week” and NBC’s “Meet the Press.” View Archive They can be so otherworldly that they offer no guidance to those living in this one on matters of justice, freedom and how we should live together. Or they are so captive to the here-and-now that it becomes hard to distinguish between a congregation and a party headquarters. And for many in the wealthy nations and among the young, religion has no relevance to their lives whatsoever. It’s seen by some as a charming throwback and by others as one more insidious force focused on power, money and self-preservation. When Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected pope a year ago, only a few expected that the new Catholic leader would confront all of these challenges simultaneously. 1 of 27 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Pope Francis: Acts of humility View Photos The new prelate, who has been named Time magazine’s Person of the Year, is rewriting the rules in his first year at the Vatican.

Yes, his choice of the name Francis was a promising sign that he would emulate a saint devoted to the poor and to simplicity. Yes, he was already on record with searing criticisms of the injustices of global capitalism. From the beginning, he stressed his more humble role as the “Bishop of Rome,” suggesting an anti-imperial papacy. And then it continued. He disdained the trappings of piety and might, including the ornate regalia that appeal to so many prelates. The Roman joke was that as priests got with his program, one could find many lacy surplices on sale at steep discounts on eBay. On his first Holy Thursday, Francis washed the feet not of the usual group of priests but rather of a dozen young people being held at a juvenile detention center, including two women and two Muslims. He has not altered church doctrine, but his shift in emphasis has been breathtaking. “We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods,” he has said. “This is not possible.” He thus declared that the church’s main mission would no longer be as a lead combatant in the culture wars. It would stand primarily with and for the neediest. The most important aspect of a Pew survey released this month was not its finding that 68 percent of U.S. Catholics thought Francis was changing the church for the better, or that 76 percent said he was doing a good or excellent job of addressing the needs and concerns of the poor. No, the truly revealing fact about this study is that it did not even occur to Pew’s pollsters to ask in their benchmark poll a year ago whether poverty should be a priority of the new pope. This is no knock on Pew; the fact that its researchers had to include a new question about poverty this year shows how much Francis has transformed the church. The pope said recently that he was uncomfortable with being seen as a “superman,” and indeed, he is not. Francis expressed his unease in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera during which he made the most troubling misstep of the year. Speaking of the pedophilia scandal that has shaken the faith of so many Catholics, particularly in the United States and in Ireland, Francis was uncharacteristically defensive and aggressive, insisting that the Catholic Church “is perhaps the only public institution that has moved with transparency and responsibility.” “No one has done more,” he added, “and yet the church is the only one that has been attacked.” Pope Francis had a noteworthy first year as head of the Catholic church. PostTV reviews a few of the pope's memorable photo ops that seem to parallel with common Bible passages. We used The New American Bible. (Jonathan Elker, Gillian Brockell and Kate M. Tobey/The Washington Post) In fact, the church is not “the only one that has been attacked.” Even if it were, a pope who has emphasized the urgency of seeing the world from the perspective of the vulnerable and the wounded should have been the first to hear how his words might sound to the victims of abuse. A leader who has criticized a “psychology of princes” and the “spirit of careerism” should have known better. But the keen disappointment felt over this is a mark of how high Francis has lifted expectations. He has shown that the spiritual life is also a life of social commitment. He demands a lot while preaching about a God of mercy, confounding scolds and religious therapists alike. By engaging joyfully with nonbelievers and those who believe differently, he speaks to those skeptical that Christianity has anything left to say. He called for a church that is “bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets” and has proved that such a church is hard to ignore. Read more from E.J.

Immunity can also come about by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop immunity to them. In vaccination, the pathogens are usually injected under the skin. Only part of the pathogens are injected, or else weakened or dead pathogens are used. This causes an immune response without causing the disease. Diseases you are likely to have been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox. Paragraph: In Colorado, everyone makes sure they get vaccinated for measles. However in Ontario they don't like to get vaccines so most of the population skips them. One year a major measles outbreak occurs. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Given the people of Ontario are now required to get vaccinated for measles, will the infection rate in Ontario increase or decrease? Answer:","output":"Given the new requirement in Ontario for people to get vaccinated for measles, the infection rate in Ontario is likely to decrease significantly. Vaccination is a proven method of reducing the spread of infectious diseases by boosting an individual's immune system and helping them develop immunity to specific pathogens, such as the measles virus. By introducing a mandatory measles vaccination program, the Ontario government aims to increase the overall immunization coverage in the population. This increase in the number of vaccinated individuals will help limit the potential for measles outbreaks and protect those who cannot be vaccinated, such as infants or individuals with certain medical conditions, through a concept called herd immunity. Herd immunity occurs when a large percentage of the population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or previous exposure, making it difficult for the disease to spread within the community. In the case of measles, it is estimated that at least 95% of the population must be immune in order to maintain herd immunity and prevent major outbreaks. The decreased infection rate in Ontario due to the mandatory measles vaccination will not only protect the health and well-being of the residents but also lessen the burden on the healthcare system from treating those infected with the disease. Furthermore, reducing the infection rate through vaccination can result in the eventual elimination of measles, as has been the case in several countries where robust immunization programs are in place. In conclusion, given the new requirement for people in Ontario to get vaccinated for measles, the infection rate in Ontario is expected to decrease significantly, in turn protecting the overall health of the community and preventing future outbreaks of the disease."},{"instruction":"Please briefly summarize this news article: Arsenal 3-2 Hull City (aet) Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger lifts the FA Cup after the 3-2 extra-time win over Hull City. Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images The FA Cup final is on a roll. This was another engrossing game and enthralling occasion, and if there was no fairytale ending this time at least the less fancied side gave a great account of themselves. Arsenal's nine-year trophy drought is at an end while Hull's 110-year wait for major silverware goes on, though you would never have guessed watching a memorable final that there was such a disparity between the aspirations and achievements of the two sides. Strictly speaking Arsène Wenger is no longer a specialist in failure, though his team still look a long way short of the Arsenal of old and it is debatable whether being pushed all the way by Wigan in the semi and now Hull in the final amounts to the sort of success that can be crowed about. There are still questions that need to be answered, though as Yaya Sanogo tweeted before the game Arsenal have at least managed to win more than Chelsea, even if it was the 19th minute of extra time before Aaron Ramsey finally put the Gunners in front, applying a snappy first-time finish to Olivier Giroud's clever back-heel pass. Giroud had hit the bar from Ramsey's cross in the first period of extra time so Hull probably knew they had it coming. They had defended doggedly for much of the game to give themselves a chance of a penalty shootout, but had no answer to the fresh legs Wenger was able to introduce for the final 15 minutes of extra time. By astutely keeping back Jack Wilshere and Tomas Rosicky until the break in extra time, Wenger added some much-needed energy and invention and, though the pair were not directly involved in the winning goal, their arrival seemed to daunt their opponents. For all that, penalties might still have been needed had not Arsenal survived a last-gasp scare when Lukasz Fabianski came out of his area and failed to stop a run from Sone Aluko, whose shot from a narrow angle missed only by inches. With the same player bringing a save from Fabianski right at the death the drama at the end was intense. Some two and a half hours earlier the game had got off to the brightest of starts, with Hull taking the lead from virtually their first attack. Ahmed Elmohamady won a corner on the right, Stephen Quinn hit it long to pick out Tom Huddlestone loitering just outside the area for a volley and, though the execution was imperfect and the shot was missing the target, James Chester managed a back-heel deflection on the way through to leave Fabianski wrong-footed. If that was encouraging for Steve Bruce's side, the Tigers were in dreamland four minutes later when Hull doubled their lead. This time Fabianski was not quite so blameless. He should have dealt better with a tame header from Alex Bruce from a Quinn cross rather than letting it bounce off his left post, allowing Curtis Davies to joyfully snaffle the rebound. The reason so many Hull defenders were in forward positions was that they had just come up for a free-kick that Arsenal only half-cleared. As one of the major questions about Hull's ability to contest this final was whether they would score a goal at all, with Shane Long injured and Nikica Jelavic ineligible, scoring twice in the opening eight minutes was an entirely unexpected boost. The only nagging doubt at the back of Hull minds would have been whether the goals had come too early. They had caught Arsenal off guard but Wenger's side did have recognised goalscorers and as long as they did not panic still had more than 80 minutes to play themselves back into the match. Those fears began to take shape when Santi Cazorla arrowed a shot direct from a free-kick into Allan McGregor's top-left corner after Bruce had fouled him a couple of yards outside the area. Sumptuous as the strike was, there was not much bend or dip on the shot, and the goalkeeper had a clear enough sight of it to be disappointed when it flew past him. Arsenal were dominating the game by the end of the first half, rarely allowing Hull the opportunity to cross the halfway line, and could have been level had Ramsey been able to supply a finish when Mesut Özil rolled a ball invitingly across the Hull goal. Bruce had seen a header cleared off the line by Kieran Gibbs from a corner, but if Hull were only threatening from set pieces and Arsenal were pinning them in their own half, McGregor's goal was always likely to be the one under threat. When Matty Fryatt managed a rare breakaway just past the half-hour, he looked up from an advanced position on the left and found precisely no one in the middle awaiting a cross or a pass. Huddlestone sent a shot over Fabianski's bar a couple of minutes later to raise an optimistic cheer from the Hull end, though it was from 30 yards out and Arsenal were comfortable with goal attempts from that sort of distance. Özil pulled another inviting ball back across the Hull goal at the start of the second half but found Lukas Podolski unable to take advantage, before Huddlestone sent another harmless shot over Fabianski's bar merely as a more elegant way of time-wasting than some of his team-mates had already been managing. By the hour stage, with Arsenal coming no closer to a goal than a desperately hopeful tumble by Giroud in the hope of a penalty after the slightest of touches by Huddlestone, Wenger sent on Yaya Sanogo to show his pre-match tweet was not merely wishful thinking. With Laurent Koscielny putting a header wide from a corner, however, Arsenal needed a goal to make history and make José Mourinho reconsider his words. As the game entered its final 20 minutes, with the Hull goal far from under siege, Arsenal looked the team under pressure and hopes of a Tiger feat began to grow. So it was slightly cruel when Arsenal equalised, not with a flash of brilliance from Özil or Ramsey but through a scruffy goal at a set piece. Cazorla's corner was played back towards McGregor's goal by a couple of ricochets from Hull defenders, to allow Koscielny, standing in front of the goalkeeper, to turn and scuff the ball across the line. For the Arsenal fans at that end the goal was a thing of beauty. For the Hull support at the other end of the pitch the disappointment will only increase when they see on television that McGregor was correct in protesting that the corner should never have been awarded in the first place. Gibbs had the best chance of securing a result in normal time when he produced one of the great Wembley misses from the six-yard line but Ramsey was more deadly when his extra-time opportunity arrived. Arsenal's celebrations at the end were almost as heartfelt and joyous as Wigan's 12 months ago but, even as Wenger soaked up the champagne, the bookies were quoting his side as odds-on to win no trophies next year. For Arsenal this was a huge relief but not quite a fairy tale. Summary:","output":"In a very exciting soccer game, Arsenal and Hull City played against each other. Arsenal won 3-2 and their manager Arsène Wenger was very happy. Hull City played really well too, but they couldn't win this time.

Researchers have traced this water back to the Moon's early developmental stages, suggesting that it originated from asteroid impacts during its infancy, a time when the celestial body comprised mainly of magma oceans. This discovery provides crucial insight into our understanding of the Earth's oldest and closest neighbor, and it has far-reaching implications for future space missions and potential lunar inhabitation. The Moon's Early History: A Sea of Magma The Moon's story began nearly 4.5 billion years ago, shortly after the formation of the Solar System. It is believed that a Mars-sized object named Theia collided with Earth, leading to the ejection of various debris, which eventually coalesced to create the Moon. During the Moon's early years, its surface was covered by a molten \\"magma ocean\\" reaching depths of up to 200 kilometers. The ocean eventually cooled and solidified, forming the Moon's crust and mantle. Scientists have been able to study this process through lunar materials brought back by the Apollo missions and remote sensing data from orbital spacecraft. This window into the past helps unravel mysteries surrounding the Moon's formation and evolution. Asteroids: The Source of Lunar Water It was long assumed that the Moon was bone-dry, as any water it inherited during its formation would have presumably evaporated due to the high temperatures and lack of atmosphere. However, recent findings have challenged this notion, indicating that water is, indeed, present deep within the lunar interior. The study posits that some 4.3 to 4.5 billion years ago, water-rich asteroids were attracted by the Moon's gravitational pull and collided with the lunar magma ocean. Contrary to previously held theories, the impacts did not boil off the water from the asteroids, instead, it was integrated into the magma itself. The water eventually found a way to become part of the minerals that formed during the crystallization of the magma ocean. Upon the solidification of these minerals, water became trapped in their lattice-like atomic structure. This occurrence is the reason behind the traces of water deep within the Moon's mantle and its relative scarcity on the surface. These revelations have paved the way for a deeper understanding of the Moon's composition and its evolution over billions of years. Implications of the Lunar Water Discovery The discovery of water on the Moon has broad implications, most notably for future space exploration and lunar inhabitation. The presence of water holds the potential of sustaining human life on the Moon, providing life support resources, and aiding in the production of rocket fuel. Furthermore, this may bolster NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024 and establish a sustainable lunar presence by the end of the decade. Additionally, understanding the Moon's water content and distribution will inevitablely contribute to a more comprehensive grasp of its geological processes. As our knowledge of its complex history expands, so does our understanding of the vast universe we inhabit. Conclusion The presence of water on Earth's closest neighbor, the Moon, has long been a subject of debate and interest. As our knowledge expands through significant advancements in the field of lunar science, we are beginning to unveil the secrets hidden deep beneath the Moon's surface. The finding that water was delivered to the Moon through asteroid impacts during its early, magma-rich years has provided valuable insights into the Moon's past and its potential future role in human space exploration. The ongoing quest for lunar knowledge continues, with every discovery taking us one step closer to unlocking the mysteries of the cosmos."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: \\"Which infectious disease is characterised by ulceration and inflammation of the bowel with generalised toxaemia and \\"\\"wasting\\"\\", usually caused via infection of food contaminated by flies?\\"","output":"Oh, ok!

When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called crevasses develop in the fracture zone. Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity. If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, shear forces cause them to break apart, opening a crevasse. Crevasses are seldom more than 46 m (150 ft) deep but in some cases can be 300 m (1,000 ft) or even deeper. Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form.

Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population. The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors. Why were alternative energy sources judged uneconomical in 2001?","output":"In 2001, alternative energy sources like wind and hydroelectric power in Alaska were judged as uneconomical due to various factors. The main reasons include: 1. Low fuel prices: At the time, fuel prices were less than 50¢ per gallon, which made the traditional diesel fuel a cheaper and more economically viable option than investing in new alternative energy infrastructures. The low costs of diesel fuel reduced the incentives to pursue and develop alternative energy options. 2. Long distances: Alaska is a vast territory, and creating a statewide energy system would require substantial infrastructure development to connect and distribute power from alternative energy sources to different regions. The long distances between communities and power generation sites would result in high costs of constructing and maintaining such systems. 3. Low population: Alaska has a sparse population, concentrated mainly in urban areas. A statewide energy infrastructure would need to cater to a relatively small number of consumers, which diminishes the economies of scale that usually benefit energy production and distribution systems. This factor reduces the financial feasibility of large-scale alternative energy projects. 4. High transportation costs: In addition to distance-related expenses, Alaska's unique geographical makeup presents challenges in transporting necessary infrastructure, materials, and personnel to remote locations. The state's rugged terrain, harsh weather conditions, and limited access to roadways contribute to increased transportation costs, making alternative energy projects more expensive to execute. 5. Seasonal usage peaks: The demand for energy varies throughout the year, with peaks during winter months when heating is required. These seasonal fluctuations would make it difficult for reliable alternative energy sources to match the consistent energy output of diesel fuel-based systems. In addition, some renewable sources like wind and hydroelectric power can be affected by seasonal weather patterns, leading to periods of reduced power generation. 6. Existing petroleum development infrastructure: Finally, at the time of the report, the state's economy was heavily dependent on the petroleum industry, which provided both jobs and infrastructure. Investing in alternative energy would require significant resources and may have faced resistance from entrenched interests who had an economic stake in preserving the existing energy setup. In summary, alternative energy sources were judged uneconomical in 2001 due to low fuel prices, long distances, low population, high transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, and existing petroleum development infrastructure. These factors combined made diesel fuel a more attractive and financially viable option for Alaska at that time."},{"instruction":"How is \\"Here the spotlight will naturally fall on the employees of seed producing companies, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has repeatedly pointed out.\\" said in Finnish?","output":"The sentence \\"Here the spotlight will naturally fall on the employees of seed producing companies, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has repeatedly pointed out.\\" can be translated into Finnish as follows: \\"Tässä luonnollisesti kiinnitetään huomiota siemenyritysten työntekijöihin, kuten herra Graefe zu Baringdorf on toistuvasti korostanut.\\" Here are the translations of each individual part of the sentence to make the translation process clear: 1. \\"Here the spotlight will naturally fall on\\" - \\"Tässä luonnollisesti kiinnitetään huomiota\\" 2. \\"the employees of seed producing companies\\" - \\"siemenyritysten työntekijöihin\\" 3. \\"as\\" - \\"kuten\\" 4. \\"Mr. Graefe zu Baringdorf\\" - \\"herra Graefe zu Baringdorf\\" 5. \\"has repeatedly pointed out\\" - \\"on toistuvasti korostanut\\" As for the terms, in Finnish, \\"employees\\" is translated as \\"työntekijät\\", and \\"seed producing companies\\" is translated as \\"siemenyritykset\\", and the whole phrase is combined as \\"siemenyritysten työntekijöihin\\", where \\"siemenyritysten\\" is the genitive plural form of \\"siemenyritykset\\", meaning \\"of seed companies\\", and \\"työntekijöihin\\" is the illative plural form of \\"työntekijä\\", meaning \\"into the workers\\".

The Texans began their season with a home game against the Indianapolis Colts, a division rival in which they had only beaten once ever. However, Houston got off to an early 13-0 lead after 30 and 49-yard field goals from Neil Rackers (who had recently replaced Kris Brown as the team's kicker) and a 22-yard touchdown pass from Matt Schaub, leading passer in the league a year ago, to Kevin Walter. As expected, the Colts wouldn't go down without a fight as Indy scored ten unanswered points to close out the half on a 14-yard touchdown pass from Peyton Manning to Reggie Wayne and a 20-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri. With the momentum seemingly shifting to Indianapolis, Houston took nearly eight minutes off the third-quarter clock with a 15-play drive (13 rushes) out of the locker room, as Arian Foster scored from a yard out, his first of three touchdowns on the day. Going into the fourth with Houston leading 20-10, the Texans continued to run, and the Colts continued to pass, as Peyton Manning attempted 57 passes that day, completing 40, a career-high. However, it wouldn't be enough; even though the Colts scored two touchdowns on a 10-yard pass to Dallas Clark and a 73-yard pass to Austin Collie, the Texans would score two of their own: 25 and 8-yard runs from Arian Foster en route to a 34-24 Houston win at Reliant Stadium.

The postwar period began, however, with millions of displaced people homeless and starving. To counter a perceived communist threat from the Soviet Union, the US quickly set to work reconstructing the economy by transforming Japan's institutions and devising a new pacifist constitution. Article 9 renounced Japan's right to maintain armed forces, although the ambiguous wording was later taken to permit the creati on of a \\"self-defense\\" force. The zaibatsu conglomerates that had proved so instrumental in boosting Japan's militarism were disbanded, later to re-emerge as the keiretsu trading conglomerates that dominated the economy once again. The entire economy received a massive jump-start with the outbreak of the Korean War, with Japan ironically becoming the chief local supplier for an army it had battled so furiously just a few years earlier. The occupation lasted until 1952, having already planted the seeds for Japan's future stunning economic success. Economic output was back to prewar levels, and British auto companies provided the support needed to get Japan's auto industry back on its feet. Japanese companies then enthusiastically imported any Western technologies they could get their hands on. This included transistor technology — invented in the US but then considered to have only limited applications — for the surreal sum of 25,000. It was Japan that produced the world's first transistor radio. The electronic technology spurt that followed is now legendary. Parliamentary democracy finally came into its own, albeit with distinctly Japanese characteristics reflecting the dislike of debate and confrontation and the group-oriented preference for maintaining the appearance of harmony at all times. The government, through the powerful Finance Ministry and Ministry of International Trade and Industry, generously supported favored private corporations: first shipping, then cars, then electronics firms basked in the warmth of the government's loving attentions. Japan overtook Britain economically in 1964. By the end of the decade, Japan's was the third largest economy in the world — less then two decades after the war had left the country in ruins. Prosperity was not without its own problems: pollution caused by \\"dirty\\" industries, a high incidence of stomach ulcers (even suicides) among schoolchildren pressured by over-ambitious parents, and the awkward questions of what to do about nuclear energy. The famous coziness among politicians, bureaucrats, and private companies, together with the strong cultural emphasis on relationship-building and a lack of transparency and accountability, eventually led to corrupt practices of endemic proportions. Do you have any questions?","output":"It is evident that Japan experienced a remarkable journey towards peace and prosperity after the devastation of World War II. The country's transformation was driven by a combination of factors, including the influence and support from the United States, the government's facilitation of industry success, and the willingness of Japanese companies to quickly implement new technologies. You have mentioned several events and outcomes related to Japan's post-war recovery and growth, such as the introduction of a pacifist constitution, the re-emergence of zaibatsu conglomerates as keiretsu trading conglomerates, and the successful implementation of western technologies like transistor radio. Additionally, you noted some challenges faced by Japan during its rise to economic prominence, including pollution, societal pressures, and corruption. Based on your detailed response, I would like to follow up with a few further questions: 1. What measures, if any, did Japan take to mitigate the environmental impacts of their rapid industrialization, particularly concerning pollution? 2. How has Japan's educational system evolved since the post-war period to address issues like high pressure on students and the high incidence of stomach ulcers and suicides among schoolchildren? 3. In recent years, has Japan made any significant progress in addressing the endemic corruption stemming from the close relationships among politicians, bureaucrats, and private companies? 4. How did the Japanese government ensure a balance between the preservation of traditional cultural values and the adoption of western practices during the post-war period as they initiated their rapid economic growth?"},{"instruction":"Choose your answer.

Petr Cech wants assurances over his Chelsea future as Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco manoeuvre themselves into position to strike for the goalkeeper. The Czech Republic’s future at Stamford Bridge has been called into question following Jose Mourinho’s decision to start with Thibaut Courtois against Burnley on Monday night. Cech feels he has been left in the dark over his first-team prospects following the return of Courtois from Atletico Madrid earlier this summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho say he wants Petr Cech to stay at Chelsea Not happy with the bench life: Petr Cech wants assurances over his Chelsea future this summer A loan move with away from Stamford Bridge with a recall option could suit both Chelsea and","output":"Cech perfectly, allowing the talented goalkeeper to continue playing regularly while maintaining the possibility of bringing him back to the club if needed. This would provide the Blues with the security of having a world-class option on standby while ensuring Cech does not grow frustrated with a lack of playing time. Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco have both expressed an interest in securing Cech's services, with the Ligue 1 giants keen to strengthen their squads as they challenge for domestic and European honors. A move to either French side would give the Czech star an opportunity to play in the Champions League, compete for prestigious titles, and maintain his excellent form ahead of international competitions. It is believed that Jose Mourinho wants to keep Cech at Chelsea, recognizing the valuable experience and leadership the veteran goalkeeper brings both on and off the field. The Portuguese manager has been offering Cech the role of \\"mentor\\" for the young Thibaut Courtois, hoping that this might encourage the 38-year-old to stay at the club and help Courtois develop into one of the world's best goalkeepers. Moreover, Chelsea's board is acutely aware of Cech's legendary status at the club, where he has won four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Champions League, and one Europa League during his 16-year-long illustrious career. There may also be fears that selling Cech could lead to dressing-room discontent, particularly among the club's senior players, who may see it as an indication that loyalty is not valued at Stamford Bridge. However, Cech's desire for regular first-team football is understandable, given his age and continued high-quality performances. In recent years, he has demonstrated his reliability, professionalism, and elite shot-stopping skills, leading many to consider him one of the best goalkeepers in the world, despite being surpassed in the pecking order by Courtois at Chelsea. As such, Chelsea faces a difficult decision with regards to keeping or selling Petr Cech. A loan move could prove to be an ideal compromise, but it may also hurt the club's relationship with the goalkeeper in the long run. Amid this uncertainty, Cech will want to know precisely where he stands, keen to avoid wasting any time in securing his future at a club that values his talents and can offer him the first-team opportunities he craves. In conclusion, Petr Cech's Chelsea future remains in the balance as Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco circle, eager to add the experienced shot-stopper to their ranks. While Chelsea would prefer to keep their legendary goalkeeper, Cech's desire for guaranteed playing time may force the club's hand in making a decision. A loan move with a recall option could benefit both parties, but only time will tell if such a compromise can be reached and satisfy all those involved."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given two sentences.

It's obviously not going to work unless it has some power. If you have the original tv/game switchbox that came with the atari console, you can try to hook this up.","output":"After plugging the Atari into an outlet and gathering the original TV/Game switchbox that came with the Atari console, the next step is to connect the Atari to your modern television set by following these steps: 1. Locate the RF Cable: The process primarily begins by finding the RF cable that usually comes with the Atari console. This cable is responsible for transmitting the audio and video signal from the console to the television. 2. Connect the Switchbox: Attach the RF cable's RCA plug (the plug with a single pin) to the designated RCA port on the TV/Game switchbox. This switchbox has two main functions: one is to facilitate the connection between the Atari console and the television, and the other acts as a toggle switch between regular TV and the gaming console. 3. Modification for Modern TVs: Many modern TVs no longer possess an RF input, so you will need to use an RF to Coaxial adapter. You can easily find these adapters online or at local electronics stores. If using an adapter, connect the RF cable to the adapter's input and the adapter to the coaxial port (also known as the antenna or cable port) on the back of your television. 4. TV Settings: Once everything is connected, switch on the television and the Atari console. Set your TV to either channel 3 or 4 (some Atari models may have a switch specifying which channel should be used). If you have difficulties with receiving the signal, navigate to the television's settings menu and set it to analog or antenna mode to receive the RF signal. 5. Adjusting the TV/Game Switchbox: Toggle the switch on the switchbox to enable the Atari console connection. If you still don't see the game, try adjusting the antennas or fine-tuning the TV to improve reception. 6. Calibration: Once the signal is received properly, you can calibrate the gameplay to ensure smooth and efficient functioning. Precautions, like repositioning the Atari console at a comfortable distance from the player, may be taken to avoid any accidents due to entangled cords. 7. Enjoy the Game: After completing the setup process, you can now enjoy playing your favorite Atari games on a modern television set. 8. Troubleshooting: If you continue to face issues with the Atari's connectivity to your television, try double-checking the connections, removing and reinserting the game cartridge, cleaning the connectors on both the console and cartridge with a gentle cleaner, or referring to online forums for guidance. Remember that the Atari system is a vintage gaming console, and as such, there may sometimes be compatibility issues or limitations with modern television sets. You might need to experiment with different settings or connections to find what works best for your specific Atari model and TV. However, once everything is properly connected and calibrated, you can enjoy the nostalgic experience of playing Atari games on your modern television."},{"instruction":"Is the question \\"What condiment do the Dutch dip their French fries in ?\\" asking about an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric entity?","output":"The question \\"What condiment do the Dutch dip their French fries in?\\" is asking about an entity, specifically a condiment that is popular in the Netherlands for dipping French fries.

Here's a question for you: Question: What were the main causes of World War I and what event triggered its outbreak? Detailed Answer: World War I had multiple, complex causes, but four main factors contributed to the tensions that ultimately led to the conflict. These factors include: 1. Mutual Defense Alliances: Many countries in Europe formed alliances to bolster their protection and ensure mutual support in case of an attack. The major alliances during this time were the Triple Entente, consisting of France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, and the Triple Alliance with Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. These alliances turned local disputes into larger, international confrontations as countries were obligated to defend their allies. 2. Imperialism: European powers competed for territory, wealth, and influence around the globe, particularly in Africa and Asia. This competition fueled rivalries, distrust, and a scramble for resources, contributing to an atmosphere of uncertainty and tension. 3. Militarism: The countries involved in WWI built up their military power, embracing the idea that a strong military force was crucial to a nation's well-being. This arms race, combined with aggressive military strategies, made the nations more likely to resort to war to settle disputes or conflicts. 4. Nationalism: Intense pride in one's country and the belief that one's nation is superior to others led to the further escalation of tensions. This idea was particularly potent in the Balkans, where multiple ethnic groups desired independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The event that ultimately triggered the outbreak of World War I was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on June 28, 1914. The assassination took place in Sarajevo during the Archduke's visit to the city. Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Serbian nationalist secret society called the Black Hand, carried out the assassination. Following the assassination, a complex web of diplomatic maneuvering and ultimatums ensued, culminating in Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Serbia on July 28, 1914. Due to the mutual defense alliances in place, other European powers were drawn into the conflict, leading to a full-scale war that lasted until November 11, 1918."},{"instruction":"This is some data: 200 Public Square, location, Cleveland; Cleveland, isPartOf, Cuyahoga County, Ohio; Cleveland, isPartOf, Ohio; Cleveland, country, United States; Cleveland, governingBody, Cleveland City Council.

The series originally aired for five seasons between June 3, 2013, and June 6, 2018, on ABC Family (later renamed Freeform). The show was created by Peter Paige and Bradley Bredeweg and follows the lives of the Foster family, led by a lesbian couple, Stef and Lena. They are the parents of a complex and diverse group of children, some biological and others adopted. The series explores various themes, such as foster care, adoption, LGBTQ+ issues, and family dynamics. After the series concluded in 2018, a spin-off show titled \\"Good Trouble\\" was developed. The spin-off follows the lives of Callie and Mariana, two characters from The Fosters, as they navigate life in their early 20s in Los Angeles. \\"Good Trouble\\" premiered on January 8, 2019, and has since aired multiple seasons. In terms of the original series, there are no immediate plans for a new episode or a revival. Although the show remains popular with dedicated fans and has garnered a loyal following, the creators and producers have moved on to other projects. However, fans can hold onto hope for possible reunions or special events surrounding the series in the future, as it's not unusual for beloved series to make a comeback in some form.

Answer:","output":"The New York stadium that was home to the New York Mets from 1964-2008 is Shea Stadium, located in the Flushing neighborhood of the Queens borough in New York City. It was officially opened on April 17, 1964, as part of the Flushing Meadow Park project, which also included the construction of nearby facilities for the 1964-1965 World's Fair. Named after attorney William A. Shea, who was instrumental in the efforts to bring National League baseball back to New York City after the Dodgers and Giants left for California, Shea Stadium served as a vital part of the city's sports history for more than four decades. During its tenure as the home of the New York Mets, Shea Stadium witnessed many memorable moments in the franchise's history. One of the most notable events was the Mets' World Series championship win in the 1969 season, which saw the team dubbed the \\"Miracle Mets\\" because of their unexpected success. The stadium also hosted the All-Star Game in 1964 and witnessed additional Mets playoff runs, including another World Series win in 1986 and National League Championship Series appearances in 1999 and 2000. Aside from its primary role as a baseball stadium, Shea Stadium served many other purposes throughout its existence. As a multi-purpose venue, it hosted NFL games for the New York Jets from 1964-1983, numerous concerts, including appearances from legendary musicians such as The Beatles, and various other sporting and non-sporting events. The Beatles' performance at Shea Stadium on August 15, 1965, is regarded as a pivotal moment in rock history and helped to cement the band's international fame. The stadium's versatility was a testament to its design, which allowed for easy conversion between different event configurations. As the years went on, Shea Stadium began to show its age and lag behind newer, more modern stadiums in terms of amenities and facilities. In response to this, plans were developed for a new ballpark to replace the aging stadium. In 2006, construction began on Citi Field, located in the adjacent parking lot. The New York Mets played their final season at Shea Stadium in 2008, with the final game taking place on September 28, 2008, against the Florida Marlins. Demolition work began on Shea Stadium in October 2008, shortly after the conclusion of the 2008 baseball season. The demolition process took several months to complete, with the majority of the stadium structure being dismantled by March 2009. A formal ceremony to mark the demolition's end was held on May 13, 2009. Today, Citi Field stands proudly as the home of the New York Mets, continuing the team's storied history in a state-of-the-art facility that offers fans an unparalleled baseball experience. Shea Stadium, while no longer standing, remains a cherished memory for many Mets fans and an essential part of New York City's sports history. The site where Shea Stadium once stood is now used as a parking lot for Citi Field, serving as a reminder of the past while looking forward to the future of the franchise."},{"instruction":"Translate to Czech: Krasohoria Lemesou - Afames Wine with a protected designation of origin (PDO)","output":"Krasohoria Lemesou - Víno Afames s chráněným označením původu (CHOP) Step-by-step: 1.

Q: Post: @RealCandaceO But those are illegal immigrants children Candace. They have more rights than our American children.#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #BuildThatWall #AmericaFirst A:","output":"To analyze the content of the post, we can see that it voices a strong political viewpoint concerning immigration and policy in the United States. The user utilizes hashtags such as #BuildThatWall and #AmericaFirst that reflect support for stronger immigration control and a nationalist perspective. In terms of classifying the target being harassed in the post, it can be interpreted that there are essentially two groups being discussed here. The first is 'illegal immigrants children', and the second one would be 'our American children'. However, the post does not appear to single out one specific individual for harassment. Instead, it criticizes or targets groups in general: children of illegal immigrants and American children. Therefore, the harassed target in this post would be categorized as 'generic' because the user’s language targets groups (children of illegal immigrants and American children), not a specific individual. Furthermore, the account '@RealCandaceO' appears to be addressed in the post's context, but this username does not necessarily denote the target of harassment; it might merely be a part of conversation. This post criticizes general policy issues and groups, whereas harassment would typically involve aiming personal attacks at a specific person.

This car stinks. Available choices: a). unacceptable b). acceptable","output":"b). acceptable The sentence \\"This car stinks.\\" can be considered correct by the strictest standards of a linguist for several reasons. 1. Grammatical correctness: The sentence follows the basic structure of a declarative sentence in the English language, which consists of a subject, a verb, and sometimes an object or complement. In this case, \\"this car\\" is the subject, \\"stinks\\" is the verb, and there is no object or complement. The subject and the verb agree in terms of number, which is another important aspect of grammatical correctness. 2. Word choice: The words used in the sentence are appropriate and convey meaning effectively. \\"This car\\" is a specific reference to a particular car, while \\"stinks\\" is an informal but commonly used verb that indicates something has an unpleasant smell, is of poor quality, or is disagreeable. Although \\"stinks\\" can be considered informal or colloquial, it does not affect the grammatical correctness of the sentence. 3. Clarity: The sentence is clear and easily understood by the reader. It communicates a message effectively, expressing that the speaker or writer has a negative opinion about the car, most likely regarding its smell or overall quality. 4. Idiomatic usage: The phrase \\"stinks\\" is idiomatic and widely recognized in the English language. It is a metaphorical way of expressing dissatisfaction with something or someone, and is commonly used in a variety of contexts. In this sentence, the usage of \\"stinks\\" clearly conveys the speaker's negative opinion about the car. Although the sentence \\"This car stinks.\\" can be considered informal or colloquial, it is still grammatically correct and acceptable from a linguistic standpoint. Therefore, the best answer is b) acceptable."},{"instruction":"Q:In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Two groups of soldiers started different training programs. Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group. Which group didn't increase the efficiency of their cardiac muscle as much as the other group? A:","output":"The Blue group, which participated in weight training for 3 months, didn't increase the efficiency of their cardiac muscle as much as the Brown group, which ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Brown group's exercise regimen focused on cardiovascular activities, leading to a stronger and more efficient cardiac muscle due to the increased heart rate and blood flow experienced while running. In contrast, weight training primarily targets the development of skeletal muscles and does not have the same impact on the efficiency of cardiac muscles as cardiovascular exercises like running."},{"instruction":"Definition: Given news headlines, an edited word and funniness labels.

However, it still depends on the wind direction and strength. b. post office - The post office is where the mail comes from and is not likely where the scattered mail landed. Therefore, it can be ruled out as a possible location. c. usps - USPS usually refers to the United States Postal Service, which is responsible for delivering the mail.

And I was wondering Why did Bailey do this? Choose from: [I] speak full sentences [II] mumble [III] communicate A:","output":"Bailey, the baby who was learning to speak, turned a phrase to communicate. As a developing child, Bailey is constantly absorbing information from the environment and the people around them. Language acquisition is an essential part of a child's growth and development, and it enables them to better understand and convey their needs, feelings, and ideas with others. Turning a phrase signifies that Bailey is making progress in learning and beginning to understand how to effectively communicate. There are several reasons why Bailey turned a phrase in order to communicate: 1. Cognitive development: As a baby, Bailey is undergoing significant cognitive development, particularly in terms of understanding language structure and syntax. By turning a phrase, Bailey demonstrates that they have started to assimilate and internalize the rules of their native language. 2. Imitation: Babies and young children learn language primarily through imitation. They listen to the people around them and start to mimic their words, gestures, and tone of voice. Bailey's ability to turn a phrase suggests that they have been exposed to a language-rich environment and are beginning to imitate the speech patterns of those around them. 3. Social interaction: Communication is the cornerstone of social interaction, and as a baby, Bailey is beginning to explore the world around them and engage with others. Turning a phrase allows Bailey to make their needs, wants, and emotions known to their caregivers and other people, helping to foster relationships and develop social skills. 4. Encouragement from caregivers: Children often need encouragement and guidance from their caregivers to develop language skills. It is likely that Bailey's family or caregivers have been actively supporting their language development by speaking to them consistently, responding to their attempts at communication, and providing positive feedback when they speak correctly. 5. Natural language milestone: Turning a phrase is a normal milestone in a child's linguistic development. It signifies that Bailey is progressing through the stages of language acquisition and is on their way to becoming a capable communicator. In this instance, Bailey did not choose to speak in full sentences or mumble, but instead opted for minimal verbal communication through turning a phrase. This can likely be attributed to their age and developmental stage. As Bailey continues to grow and develop, they will likely begin using full sentences and more complex language structures, allowing them to communicate even more effectively and with greater clarity."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

The pair met at the age of 15 at the Alabama School of Fine Arts. They fronted a band called Little Red Rocket, often compared to Veruca Salt, in their hometown of Birmingham, Alabama in the mid and late 1990s and released two albums with the band on Tim/Kerr records. - Art in Manila (formerly Art Bell) is an indie rock band consisting of Adrianne Verhoeven (The Anniversary), Dan McCarthy (McCarthy Trenching), Steve Bartolomei (Mal Madrigal), Ryan Fox (The Good Life), Corey Broman (Dance Me Pregnant), and Stefanie Drootin (The Good Life) led by a former member of Azure Ray, Orenda Fink. They are currently signed to Saddle Creek Records. - The Anniversary is an American band formed in Lawrence, Kansas in 1997 by Josh Berwanger, James David, Christian Jankowski, Adrianne Verhoeven and Justin Roelofs. The Anniversary was the solidification of a line-up that had been in flux for a year. After two years of playing shows across with the Midwest with bands that included The Get Up Kids, Braid and Superchunk, The Anniversary signed to Vagrant Records. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Britpop is a UK based music and culture movement in the mid 1990s which emphasised \\"Britishness\\", and produced bright, catchy pop music partly in reaction to the US led grunge music and the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The most successful bands associated with the movement are Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp; those groups would come to be known as its \\"big four\\". The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993-1997, with 1994-1995, and a chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \\"The Battle of Britpop\\", being the epicentre of activity. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with artists such as Damien Hirst being involved in creating videos for Blur, and being labelled as Britart or Britpop artists, and Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Set the Woods on Fire is the first full - length studio album from indie rock band Art in Manila . - Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals. - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop. - Orenda Fink (born September 18, 1975) is an American musician on Saddle Creek Records.

Output:","output":"The task here is to create a new but similar sentence in German by slightly tweaking the given sentence while maintaining its semantics and syntax. Additionally, the new sentence must be plausible, meaning it should make sense and could possibly be true. In the given German sentence \\"Ein Schiff kann auf dem d segeln\\" (A ship can sail on the d), however, there seems to be an error. Let's assume the correct sentence is \\"Ein Schiff kann auf dem Meer segeln\\" (A ship can sail on the sea). To respond to this task, you would: Step 1: Identify the most crucial parts of the sentence. In this example, it's the object \\"Schiff\\" (ship) and the action \\"segeln\\" (sail). Step 2: Think about what changes can be made to the sentence that maintain semantics (meaning) and syntax (structure). You could change the object, or change the action. For example, you can swap \\"Schiff\\" with \\"Boot\\" (boat), which is related and maintains the semantic meaning of a vehicle that traverses water. Step 3: Make sure the sentence remains grammatically correct. The sentence, after replacing \\"Schiff\\" with \\"Boot\\", becomes: \\"Ein Boot kann auf dem Meer segeln.\\" Remember, any changes you make should align with the guideline of the task and the sentence should still be plausible.

Eyes: The primary function of the eyes is to provide vision. Although they can produce tears, which may contain some waste products, they are not considered a main organ of excretion. 2. Lungs: The primary function of the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the body and the environment. When we exhale, we release carbon dioxide as a waste product from cellular respiration. Therefore, lungs can be considered a main organ of excretion. 3. Brains: The primary function of the brain is to control and coordinate bodily functions, process sensory information, and generate thoughts. It does not actively participate in the removal of waste products from the body. Therefore, it is not a main organ of excretion. 4. Kidneys: The primary function of the kidneys is to filter blood and remove waste products and excess water from the body, forming urine which is then excreted from the body.

At the same time, the general public doesn't seem to like or trust her all that much. In a deep dive to explore this \\"Gap,\\" Klein interviewed dozens of people who have known her for years and began with the same question: \\"What is true about the Hillary Clinton you’ve worked with that doesn’t come through on the campaign trail?\\" He kept getting the same answer, so much so that the responses \\"startled me in their consistency,\\" writes Klein. \\"Hillary Clinton, they said over and over again, listens.\\" If you must pause to roll your eyes, Klein acknowledges that he pretty much did the same, at least the first few times he heard the answer. After about the 15th time, though, it began to sink in and make sense to him. \\"Presidential campaigns are built to showcase the stereotypically male trait of standing in front of a room speaking confidently—and in ways that are pretty deep, that’s what we expect out of our presidential candidates,\\" writes Klein. Clinton, on the other hand, built her campaign on \\"deep relationships.\\" Contrast her wealth of Senate endorsements with those of Sanders, the better orator. Instead of praise for racking them up, however, she caught flak for being an establishment figure. \\"Thus was her core political strength reframed as a weakness.\\" And \\"here’s the thing about the particular skills Clinton used to capture the Democratic nomination: They are very, very relevant to the work of governing. And they are particularly relevant to the way Clinton governs.\\" Read Klein's full analysis. Or check out this reaction at MinnPost, which generally lauds the piece as insightful but suggests that Klein stretches the point too far in explaining Clinton's Iraq War vote. Expand this summary.","output":"Ezra Klein of Vox sets out to explore the seemingly paradoxical public perception of Hillary Clinton: while those who work closely with her express exceptional admiration for her as a person and a professional, the general public appears to dislike and distrust her. In an attempt to understand this \\"gap,\\" Klein interviewed numerous individuals who have known Clinton for years and discovered a surprising consistency in their responses when asked about the lesser-known qualities of Clinton they had worked with: \\"Hillary Clinton, they said over and over again, listens.\\" At first, Klein was skeptical of this answer but eventually began to understand that presidential campaigns are typically designed to highlight stereotypically male traits, like confidently speaking in front of a room. Clinton's campaign, however, has been built around deep relationships, as evidenced by her numerous Senate endorsements compared to Bernie Sanders' style of delivering powerful speeches. This focus on relationships and listening has caused her core political strength to be re-framed as a weakness, as evidenced in the criticism of her as an establishment figure. Klein argues that these relationship-building skills, which emphasize listening and understanding, are crucial for governance and, more specifically, for the way in which Clinton governs. Therefore, the public perception gap seems to highlight a disconnect in political expectations; while traditional campaigns showcase confident oratory skills, Clinton's campaign is constructed around a different set of skills. The point being that the listening and relationship-building skills Clinton consistently demonstrates may not reflect as clearly in her public perception, but are nevertheless integral to effective governance."},{"instruction":"Based on the sentence \\"A view of fireman at work on a residential street, standing around their yellow-colored fire engines, while some civilians stand by and watch.\\", is the sentence \\"No one is watching the firemen.\\" a true sentence?","output":"No, the sentence \\"No one is watching the firemen\\" is not true.

Record-breaking field goals are unforgettable and become a part of the rich history that defines the National Football League (NFL). In this article, we will explore the powerful kick that cemented Matt Prater as the player who achieved the second longest field goal in NFL history. Step 1: Researching the Current Record Holder To set the stage for discussing the second longest field goal, we need to recognize the current record holder. In 2013, Matt Prater, then playing for the Denver Broncos, set the NFL record for the longest field goal with a 64-yard kick. This historic feat occurred during a regular season game against the Tennessee Titans. Step 2: Identifying the Second Longest Field Goal Although Matt Prater currently holds the record for the longest field goal, our primary focus in this article is the second longest field goal. The player responsible for the second longest field goal in the NFL is indeed Matt Prater as well. The 62-yard field goal was kicked during a regular season game between the Detroit Lions and the Arizona Cardinals in 2021. Step 3: Providing Context and Details about the 62-yard Field Goal On November 21, 2021, the Detroit Lions faced the Arizona Cardinals in an exciting matchup. The game took place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, and the conditions were well-suited for a record-breaking kick. With 2:06 remaining in the third quarter, Prater stepped onto the field. Focusing his energy, he managed to achieve an astonishing 62-yard field goal, which became the second longest in NFL history. Step 4: Discussing the Significance of this Achievement In the world of professional football, every yard matters; and in the kicking game, even a single yard can make the difference between success and failure. That Matt Prater holds both the longest and second longest field goals marks a truly extraordinary achievement. With his powerful leg and precision, Prater continues to solidify his place among the greatest kickers in the history of the NFL. Step 5: Comparing Prater’s Record to Other Notable Field Goals While Matt Prater is undoubtedly a dominant force in the league, it is essential to acknowledge other notable field goal achievements. Tom Dempsey, who previously held the record with his 63-yard field goal in 1970, deserves recognition for maintaining the record for four decades. Additionally, Sebastian Janikowski, David Akers, and Graham Gano have each accomplished 63-yard field goals, showcasing their impressive talents. Conclusion In conclusion, Matt Prater's impressive 62-yard field goal ranks as the second longest in NFL history. This astonishing feat is a testament to Prater's skill, consistency, and remarkable physical prowess. Today, he remains a respected figure in the world of professional football, and his dual accomplishments of holding the longest and second longest field goals will not be forgotten soon."},{"instruction":"Skylar would always have all the latest video games ready.

In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

Sleep as much as possible — if you are having difficulty in getting to sleep, try drinking a glass of warm milk. The warm fluid will relax your body and help to induce sleep. Between resting periods, try stretching your arms and legs for ten minutes each. You can also take daily 20 minutes walks — the exercise is good for you and will help you to sleep better. Abdominal cramping is very common following a miscarriage and is usually accompanied by bleeding. The pain varies from person to person, and can depend on whether the fetus was expelled naturally, or removed surgically. Taking drugs like ibuprofen help to relieve the pain, while drugs like cyclopam and buscopan are antispasmodics which lessen pain by reducing the strength of the contractions in the muscles of the uterus. The pain of the cramping should reduce naturally over time. If the pain increases over time, it is advisable to seek medical attention, as there may be more tissue left in the uterus that will need to be removed. For the first five days following a miscarriage, it is recommended that you check your temperature everyday. Any temperature over 37.60 degrees C (99.7 degrees F) should be reported to your doctor, as a high temperature may be a sign of infection in your uterus or elsewhere. Heavy to moderate vaginal bleeding is expected following a miscarriage, as the uterus expels tissue leftover from the pregnancy. Sanitary towels should be used to absorb the heavier bleeding, but you can switch to tampons once it eases off a little. Both sanitary towels and tampons should be changed every 8 hours, at the very minimum. You should also make an effort to shower at least once a day (and preferably twice). This helps to maintain good hygiene and reduces your chances of developing an infection. Avoid douching and don't use any strong disinfectant soaps or chemicals around the vagina. This can irritate the area and cause an infection. Hot and cold compresses can be used to relieve the pain of headaches, along with abdominal cramps and back pain. Alternating between hot and cold compresses is a good idea, as heat helps to relax the muscles, while cold helps to numb any pain. You can buy special hot and cold packs for this very purpose, or you can make your own by soaking a washcloth in hot or cold water and wringing it out before using. You could also use a bag of frozen peas for a cold compress and a hot water bottle for a hot compress. Press the hot compress against the painful area for 20 to 25 minutes at a time, then switch to the cold one, or vice versa. It is advisable to avoid having sexual intercourse for the first 1 to 2 months following a miscarriage — this gives the vagina time to heal. Once you begin having sex again, it is recommended that you use contraceptives because there is an increased likelihood of becoming pregnant again before your normal period is due (usually one month to six weeks after the miscarriage). This is particularly important if you and your partner do not want to conceive again so soon.","output":"Rest and sleep are crucial in the first 24 hours after a miscarriage, as they help your body adjust and recover from the loss.

While driving on the freeway, Hunter accidentally rear ended Nelson's car so","output":"While driving on the freeway, Hunter accidentally rear-ended Nelson's car, consequently leading to an unfortunate series of events that would deeply impact their lives and evoke valuable life lessons. The collision occurred during the late afternoon rush hour, as the sun began to dip below the horizon and the city was painted with warm hues of orange and crimson. Despite being a relatively minor fender-bender, the impact on Nelson's car caused a chain reaction, disrupting the smooth flow of traffic. Within moments, drivers around them began honking their horns and cursing under their breath, annoyed and frustrated by the unexpected holdup. Hunter, feeling a mix of guilt and embarrassment, quickly exited his vehicle to examine the damage and apologized profusely to Nelson, who surprisingly appeared relatively unfazed by the situation. Remaining calm and collected, Nelson suggested they exchange insurance information and file a claim to resolve the matter. However, unbeknownst to both of them, this seemingly innocuous accident would have far-reaching consequences, far beyond the financial implications. As the weeks went on, Hunter and Nelson were contacted by their respective insurance companies, who attempted to settle the claim. While the general process was more tedious than they anticipated, it brought the two strangers into each other's lives – both of whom were facing their unique set of challenges at the time. Hunter, a young entrepreneur, was struggling to keep his fledgling business afloat amidst mounting debt, while Nelson, a recent divorcee, found himself juggling the joint custody of his children and coping with the emotional turmoil of his newfound singlehood. During this time, Hunter and Nelson crossed paths on several occasions, prompted by otherwise mundane matters related to their pending insurance claim. However, these interactions quickly evolved into something much more meaningful. Discovering they shared many common interests and held similar perspectives on life, what began as casual banter soon fostered a strong friendship between the two men – one that would act as a support system as they navigated their respective hardships. Through their bond, both Hunter and Nelson began to discover resilience they never knew they possessed. Hunter lent a listening ear to Nelson, helping him process the emotional weight he carried from his divorce, and encouraged him to embrace the possibilities that now lay before him. Nelson, in turn, acted as a sounding board for Hunter's business ideas, offering sage advice, and instilling in him the confidence he required to persevere in his entrepreneurial pursuits. As months turned into years, the friendship between Hunter and Nelson continued to flourish – the silver lining of their misfortunate encounter on the freeway. Their lives changed for the better, both personally and professionally, as they supported each other through thick and thin. Hunter's business eventually stabilized and began to prosper, while Nelson found peace in his new life, establishing a healthy co-parenting relationship with his ex-spouse. In retrospect, the day Hunter accidentally rear-ended Nelson's car on the freeway served as a turning point, unbeknownst to them at that moment. While it seemed like an unpleasant and unfortunate incident initially, it ultimately catalyzed an enduring connection that enriched both their lives in more ways than they could have ever imagined.

Answer choices: - Flowers - Embryo - Oxygen - seeds - Slate - food - fertile - Amoeba Answer:","output":"Fertilization of gametes produces something that becomes an Embryo. In the process of fertilization, two gametes, which represent the male and female reproductive cells, attempt to merge. Gametes contain half of the genetic information necessary for an organism's development. Therefore, when a male gamete (sperm) and a female gamete (egg) combine during fertilization, they create a zygote. This zygote is a single cell carrying the full set of genetic material (DNA), which is necessary for the formation of a new, unique organism. The zygote then starts to divide into many cells, a process known as cleavage. This multi-cellular entity—now termed an embryo—proceeds to develop further over time, eventually transforming into an organism. In human beings, for instance, this embryo will grow and develop over nine months to become a fully-formed baby. In plants, the fertilized gametes are usually enclosed in a seed coat and become a seed which, under the right conditions, will germinate and grow into a plant. So, if fertilization of gametes produces something, it is something that becomes an embryo. This embryo can develop into a complex organism, whether it's a human, an animal, or a plant, depending on the species from which the gametes originate. The other options such as flowers, oxygen, slate, food, fertile, and amoeba are not directly the result of the fertilization of gametes. Specifically: - Flowers: These are the reproductive parts of plants where gametes are produced, but they are not a result of fertilization itself. - Oxygen: Oxygen is a gas that organisms need to live; it's not produced by fertilization. - Slate: Slate is a type of rock. It is unrelated to biological reproduction and fertilization. - Food: While many food sources are the result of sexual reproduction in plants and animals, it's not correct to say that food is directly produced by the fertilization of gametes. - Fertile: Fertile refers to the ability to become pregnant or to make someone pregnant; it isn't a product of fertilization. - Amoeba: Amoeba is a type of single-celled organism. They reproduce through binary fission, a form of asexual reproduction, not through gamete fertilization. In conclusion, based on the options given, the accurate answer would be an \\"Embryo.\\" This process of fertilization leading to an embryo is an essential part of the biological life cycle and responsible for genetic diversity, which enables species to evolve and adapt over time."},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem?

Possible answers: - yes. - it is not possible to tell. - no.","output":"It is not possible to tell. While a winter storm blanketing the Midwest with heavy snow might suggest that residents could engage in activities like making snowmen or going sledding in the fluffy white snow, we cannot definitively conclude this just from the provided information. There are several factors that could influence whether or not residents would actually participate in these snow-related activities, which need to be taken into consideration. 1. Safety concerns: Weather experts described this snowstorm as one of the worst in decades, which might have dissuaded some residents from going outside due to potential hazards. Blizzards and heavy snowfalls can cause poor visibility and dangerous travel conditions. Many people may have opted to stay indoors to avoid potential accidents and injuries. 2. Individual preferences and interests: Even if the snowfall was picturesque and conducive to activities like making snowmen and sledding, it is important to acknowledge that not all residents may be interested in participating in these activities. People's interests and preferences vary, and some might prefer to stay indoors and watch movies or engage in other preferred hobbies. 3. Cold temperatures: Winter storms typically bring frigid temperatures, which could impact residents' willingness to engage in outdoor activities such as snowman-making and sledding. Extreme cold can be uncomfortable and dangerous if not properly prepared, so some residents may have chosen to stay warm and safe indoors. 4. Timing and duration: The duration and timing of the snowstorm might have impacted the residents' ability to enjoy snow-related activities. If the storm was short-lived or occurred at a time when most people were at work or sleeping, it might not have provided the opportunity for residents to participate in snow-play. In summary, while it is possible that some residents might have made snowmen and gone sledding in the fluffy white snow during the winter storm that blanketed the Midwest, we cannot definitively say that this occurred without more information about the specific circumstances and conditions in that region."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Facts: - death place: thiruvananthapuram , kerala , india - death date: april 3 , 1991 - birth date: 1926 - name: p. k. balakrishnan - nationality: indian - image: p. k. balakrishnan.gif - birth place: edavanakkad , ernakulam , kingdom of cochin - occupation: novelist fighter , historian , critic , essayist , freedom Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of p. k. balakrishnan .

The “Globe to Globe” tour will mark the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare’s birth, but its plans to perform in secretive North Korea has drawn skepticism from human rights activists. Amnesty Intentional urged the Globe Theatre to “read up on the reality of the country before they get there,” but stopped short of calling for the theatre to skip North Korea in its tour.

Question: suppose the cells release energy happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"B: less When cells release energy through the process of cellular respiration, it leads to a decrease in the amount of oxygen available to the body. This decrease in oxygen levels is due to the fact that oxygen is consumed during the process of breaking down glucose and oxidizing it. During cellular respiration, glucose and oxygen react to produce carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy in the process. The chemical equation for cellular respiration is: C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2 (oxygen) → 6 CO2 (carbon dioxide) + 6 H2O (water) + energy As this equation shows, the process of cellular respiration requires oxygen to be utilized, which means that the more cellular respiration that takes place, the less oxygen will be available to the body. When cells don't have enough oxygen to keep up with the pace of cellular respiration, the body must obtain more oxygen from the air. This can be achieved through increased respiration (breathing) or circulation of the blood. However, if the cells release energy and consume more oxygen, ultimately leading to less oxygen being available to the body, then this decreased oxygen availability can have a range of effects on bodily functions and overall health. Some potential impacts of a decrease in oxygen reaching the body include: 1. Reduced energy production: With less oxygen available for cellular respiration, fewer ATP molecules can be generated, which can result in decreased energy production and reduced overall body functions. 2. Fatigue and weakness: If there is not enough oxygen available to support the body's energy demands, individuals may experience a general sense of fatigue and weakness. 3. Impaired cognitive function and memory: Oxygen is vital for proper brain function, and a decrease in oxygen levels can lead to cognitive difficulties, such as problems with memory and concentration. 4. Poor circulation and cold extremities: A decrease in oxygen levels can lead to poor blood circulation, resulting in cold hands and feet, as well as potential issues with wound healing and tissue maintenance. 5. Shortness of breath and respiratory issues: When the body is not receiving enough oxygen, individuals may experience shortness of breath and potentially more serious respiratory issues. To conclude, if the cells release energy in the process of cellular respiration, consuming more oxygen, it will result in less oxygen reaching the body, which can have a variety of potential negative consequences on overall health and bodily function."},{"instruction":"Q:What key details about yuen tsun nam can be extracted from the following bio?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"the lung cant expand properly\\" happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation of \\"the lung not being able to expand properly\\" can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of delivering a greater amount of oxygen to the bloodstream. Direct effect: When the lungs are unable to expand properly, they cannot take in as much air as they normally would. The lung's primary function is to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air we breathe and our blood. The oxygen moves from the air in the lungs into the bloodstream through the alveoli – tiny air sacs where this exchange takes place. If the lungs cannot expand properly, there will be less surface area available for this gas exchange, leading to a reduced oxygen transfer into the bloodstream. Indirect effect: The reduced amount of oxygen in the bloodstream due to poor lung expansion can lead to hypoxia – a condition where the body is not receiving enough oxygen to meet its needs. This inadequate oxygen supply can have various cascading effects throughout the body, impacting various organs and systems, including the heart and brain. In severe cases, the lack of oxygen can lead to cell damage, organ failure, and ultimately death. Moreover, since talking involves the coordination of the lungs, vocal cords, and respiratory muscles, the impaired lung function might also affect a person's ability to talk. They may experience breathlessness, have a weak voice, or struggle to speak in complete sentences due to the lack of available air. In summary, the perturbation of the lung not being able to expand properly can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of delivering a greater amount of oxygen to the bloodstream, which subsequently influences a person's overall well-being and ability to talk."},{"instruction":"Context: The citys history is marked by numerous great fires.

Normal trip: Distance = 150 miles Time = 3 hours To find his normal speed, we can use the formula: Speed = Distance ÷ Time Plugging in the values, we get: Speed = 150 miles ÷ 3 hours Speed = 50 miles per hour Now, John gets lost and drives an extra 50 miles. So, the total distance he drove when he got lost is: Total distance = Normal distance + Extra distance Total distance = 150 miles + 50 miles Total distance = 200 miles We know that John's speed remained consistent at 50 miles per hour. To find the total trip time, we will use the same formula for speed but rearrange it to find time: Time = Distance ÷ Speed Plugging in the new values, we get: Time = 200 miles ÷ 50 miles per hour Time = 4 hours So, given that John kept the same speed, the trip took him 4 hours in total due to the additional 50 miles from getting lost."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which actor starred in both 1968's Academy Award-nominated ''Faces'' and 1984's ''The Glitter Dome''?

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no A step-by-step solution is:","output":"Step 1: Identify the subject of the sentence - \\"Mimes\\" Step 2: Understand the role of mimes - Mimes are performers who often use gestures, expressions, or actions to communicate without using speech. Step 3: Identify the action being performed - \\"playing tug-of-war\\" Step 4: Recognize the concept of tug-of-war - a sport that directly pits two teams against each other in a test of strength where each team pulls on opposite ends of a rope. Step 5: Apply the role of mimes to the action being performed - Mimes engaging in tug-of-war would likely be using their body language, facial expressions, and silent gestures to appear as though they are participating in the activity.

Sentence 2: We think this low rate makes our employees more dedicated. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The relationship between the two sentences can be analyzed by breaking them down into their key components and evaluating the logical connections between them. Let's first analyze each sentence individually. - Sentence 1 states two reasons behind the low rate (presumably speaking about employee turnover or retention issues) – (1) the quality and dedication of the employees themselves, and (2) the strength of the recent human capital management improvements. - Sentence 2 is more simplified, attributing the low rate directly to increased employee dedication. By comparing these two sentences, we can explore the validity of Sentence 2 given that Sentence 1 is true. In Sentence 1, employee dedication is mentioned as one of the reasons behind the low rate, which indicates that the company recognizes and values their employees' commitment, and it is considered a contributing factor to the positive outcome. Thus, Sentence 1 partially supports the claim made in Sentence 2 – dedicated employees play a role in the low rate. However, Sentence 1 also states that the recent improvements in human capital management significantly contribute to the low rate. This element is not mentioned in Sentence 2, which only connects the low rate to employee dedication. Consequently, Sentence 2 might be considered an oversimplified interpretation of the actual situation. It does not account for the company's effort to make changes to its human capital management strategies that led to the positive result. In conclusion, if Sentence 1 is true, then the second sentence is only partially true. Employee dedication is undeniably a crucial factor in maintaining a low rate in the given context, but it is not the sole contributor – the recent improvements in the company's human capital management also play an essential role. Therefore, giving credit to both factors would be a more accurate representation of the situation."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: While applying to college may seem easy, getting in can be tough! When you apply for college, you will have to be honest with yourself and do a bit of research to find the right fit. Here are three steps to take when applying to colleges for the best chances at getting into the best college for you. Step l: Making A List Of Colleges To Apply To With over 6,000 colleges in the United States, the first step in applying to college is to do some research and make a college list . This process will be different for everyone. The number of colleges you apply to can vary, from applying to 1 school (not recommended) to 30 schools (not recommended),each applicant can choose how many colleges they apply to. Many limit the number because applications are accompanied by a fee. . Step2: Splitting The List Into Target, Reach and Safety Schools In general, students will want to apply to three types of schools: Target, Reach and Safety schools. It is up to you how many applications you send, but a good mix would be more target than reach, and at least one safety. You will need to take your list, and now decide which are your top picks, which are attainable for you academically, which are affordable for you only with aid, and refine your broad list into a group of schools that gives you the best chance for success. Talk to an admissions counselor at your high school if you have questions about this. Step 3: Completing and Sending Applications to Colleges Once your list is complete you are ready to apply to college by completing and sending in applications! College applications take time to complete --you have to write essays, ask for recommendations and get test scores sent to schools--so stay organized! All colleges will require these types of application materials, so start thinking about these items well before October or December. Once you complete and send them, then you have successfully applied to college. Answer:","output":"Question: Which of the following steps is not part of the college application process as described in the article? A) Making a list of colleges to apply to B) Splitting the list into Target, Reach, and Safety schools C) Talking to a career counselor to find the ideal job before applying D) Completing and sending applications to colleges Answer: C) Talking to a career counselor to find the ideal job before applying"},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: The law provides for primary and secondary education in Albanian, Turkish, and Serbian.

One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—\\"Radio Free Europe\\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors.

Crusoe drifts on the ocean in an emergency life raft for several days and nights until landing on an uninhabited island. Crusoe builds a shelter for himself, fashions new clothing out of available materials, and begins to scout the island, discovering an abandoned Japanese submarine from World War II. Scouring the submarine, Crusoe also discovers a NASA astrochimp named Floyd, played by Dinky.Using tools and blueprints found in the submarine, Crusoe and Floyd construct a Japanese pavilion, a golf course, and a mail delivery system for sending bottles containing missives to his fiancee out to sea. Soon after, Crusoe finds that the island is not entirely uninhabited when he encounters a beautiful island girl, whom he names Wednesday. Wednesday recounts that due to her unwillingness to marry, her chieftain father, Tanamashuhi, plans to sacrifice her and her sisters to Kaboona, an immense effigy on the island with whom he pretends to communicate. The day Tanamashu arrives on the island, Crusoe uses paraphernalia from the submarine to combat him, culminating in the destruction of the Kaboona statue. After the battle, Crusoe and Tanamashu make peace. But when Crusoe makes it known that he does not wish to marry Wednesday, he is forced to flee to avoid her wrath. Pursued by a mob of irate island women, Crusoe is spotted by a U.S. Navy helicopter and he and Floyd narrowly escape with their lives.

In this task, you're given an article and an answer. Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article. Article: Some people surveyed tasted the sweet, salty, and crunchy together with other tastes of food as they listen to different noises. It shows that louder noises reduced the reported sweetness or saltiness of food while increasing the measure of crunchiness . It may go some way to explain why airline food is widely complained about by both the workers and passengers. Andy Woods, a researcher, said, \\"It's a general opinion that plane foods aren't fantastic, but I'm sure airlines do their best, so we wondered if there were other reasons. One thought was that perhaps the background noise may have an effect. NASA gives their space explorers very strong-tasting foods, because for some reason, they can't taste food that strongly--again, it may have something to do with the background noise.\\" In a study, 48 people were fed sweet foods or salty ones, while listening to nothing or noise through earphones. Meanwhile they rated the foods. In noisier settings, foods were rated less salty or sweet than they were when it was silent, but were rated crunchier. \\"The evidence shows that if the background noise is loud, your attention might be drawn to that, away from the food.\\" Dr. Woods said. \\"We are still at an early stage of progressing and this is a rather small study to really draw definitive conclusions from,\\" Dr Woods said, \\"but they suggest that restaurants could well adapt their choice of food for a given environment.\\" Also in the group's findings there is the suggestion that the overall satisfaction with the food is also related to the degree to which people like what they are hearing.

Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.
