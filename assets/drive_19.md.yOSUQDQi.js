Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","output":"Unflattering light. Step 1: Read and understand the review. In this review, the user expresses disappointment about the inaccurate song listings in the product description. They still enjoy the CD but mention the issue as a considerable downside. Step 2: Consider the complaints mentioned in the review. The main complaint in the review is the inaccurate song list on the CD, which caused the user to expect specific songs that were not included. The user did buy volumes 2, 3, and 4, where only volume 2 has listing mistakes, but volumes 3 and 4 are accurate. Step 3: Determine whether the complaints negatively or positively affect the product's perception. The inaccurate song list is a negative aspect in the user's experience, causing disappointment when they realized that their favorite song was not included. This complaint outweighs the fact that the user enjoyed the CD anyway and purchased additional volumes, making the overall tone of the review unflattering for the product."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: The temple is in the center of a walled enclosure, with a treasury of small sculptures and shrines dotted about. Sentence 2: There are small statues and shrines in and around the temple. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. In the first sentence, it is mentioned that the temple is in the center of a walled enclosure, with a treasury of small sculptures and shrines dotted about. This implies that there are various small sculptures and shrines located around the temple within the walled enclosure. The second sentence states that there are small statues and shrines in and around the temple. Since the first sentence established the presence of small sculptures and shrines around the temple, it confirms the second sentence's claim that there are indeed small statues and shrines in the vicinity of the temple. To sum up, if the first sentence is true, it provides enough information to conclude that the second sentence is also true, as both sentences refer to the presence of small sculptures and shrines scattered around or in close proximity to the temple."},{"instruction":"How is \\"What do they mean by a political debate?\\" said in Russian?","output":"When you want to ask \\"What do they mean by a political debate?\\" in Russian, you would say \\"Что они имеют в виду, говоря о политических дебатах?\\" Let me break it down for you: - Что (What) - is a question word, like when you ask about something. - они (they) - it's a word that tells us we are talking about more than one person. - имеют в виду (mean) - this phrase is used when asking about the meaning of something. - говоря о (talking about) - it shows that something is being discussed. - политических дебатах (political debates) - it's a topic people discuss where they share different opinions about politics.

In the late 1200s Marco Polo, the great explorer, is said to have seen rich Asians eating dishes of ice. Camels had brought the ice from distant mountains. Before it was served, the ice had been flavored with fruits. Marco Polo brought this new dish to Italy, In France cooks changed the ice recipe and made ice cream. At first, cooks tried to keep the recipe a secret. They wanted it to be a special dish for rich people. By the late 1700s, though, ice cream was sold throughout Europe and America. Some great Americans loved ice cream. George Washington was the first to buy a special machine for making it. When Thomas Jefferson returned from France, he brought an ice cream recipe home with him. Dolly Madison, wife of President James Madison, also liked ice cream, and she often served it at the White House. Actually, a famous brand of ice cream was even named after her. In the late 1800s, the ice cream industry began to grow. A way of keeping ice cream frozen had been found, so ice cream makers did not have to worry about ice cream melting anymore. Why can ice cream be sold everywhere today? A) Because people can afford to buy it. B) Because there are many recipes for it, C) Because it is easy to keep it frozen. D) Because many people like ice cream. A:","output":"Ice cream can be sold everywhere today primarily due to option C) Because it is easy to keep it frozen. Since ice cream is now more accessible, people from all around the world can enjoy it. Let's explore the factors that led to this widespread availability of ice cream today. Throughout the history of ice cream, its widespread popularity can be attributed to the technological advancements and innovations in storing and transporting ice cream. As mentioned in the question, around the late 1200s, Marco Polo discovered the concept of serving flavored ices while exploring Asia. During that time, ice was sourced from distant mountains and transported using camels. This limited the accessibility of ice treats to the rich who possessed the resources to bring ice from afar. When ice cream reached Europe, it went through several innovations in recipe and preparation. However, the initial lack of proper cooling and freezing technology hindered its widespread distribution. At this point, ice cream remained a luxury item for the wealthy due to the challenges of maintaining its texture and temperature during transportation. By the late 1800s, the ice cream industry began to grow rapidly due to the advent of refrigeration technology. With the development of modern cooling and freezing techniques, the ice cream could now be stored and transported much more efficiently, keeping it frozen and palatable to consumers. This development made it possible for ice cream to be mass-produced and stored without the risk of melting, which led to the establishment of ice cream parlors and its availability in local markets. Moreover, improvements in supply chain management, shipping, and storage have also contributed to ice cream's global availability. The development of insulated containers for transportation allowed ice cream to travel long distances without melting in transit, which consequently made it accessible to more people across the globe. In summary, ice cream can be sold everywhere today because it is easy to keep it frozen due to advancements in refrigeration technology, storage, and transportation methods. This has not only increased the accessibility of ice cream but has also contributed to its popularity, as a massive number of people around the world enjoy this delicious frozen treat. However, it is essential to note that the widespread popularity and affordability of ice cream (option A), the variety of recipes (option B), and the fact that many people like ice cream (option D) have also played significant roles in the global distribution and consumption of ice cream."},{"instruction":"7 Great Mobile Apps for Environmentally Friendly Eating The seemingly small eating choices that we all make every day can have a huge cumulative effect on the environment. Choosing in-season fruits and vegetables, local produce, less meat and foods that are grown with fewer pesticides can make your impact on the Earth a bit lighter. Keeping track of all the information you need to make the right choices can be a bit overwhelming, but these seven mobile apps store all you need to know in your pocket. Be sure to let us know in the comments which apps you found most helpful or what you plan to do start eating environmentally friendly. Nobody wants to destroy ecosystems when they go out for sushi, but trying to factor in where each species of fish was caught, what region it comes from, or how it was farmed can seem like a full-time job when picking where to eat. The people who do, in fact, dedicate themselves to full-time study of the planet’s water systems have mercifully created an iPhone app and mobile site to provide a guide for your seafood decisions. Search fish by name for the best choice (salmon, for instance, should be wild-caught in Alaska), good alternatives (wild-caught in Washington), and what to avoid (farmed, Atlantic-caught or wild-caught in California), and reference a best practice guide for your region. On Tuesday, the aquarium also added a new “Project FishMap” component to the app that helps you share restaurants and markets you’ve found that sell sustainable seafood. Eventually, the crowdsourced map will be a resource for finding ocean-friendly seafood wherever you are. The modern-day grocery store has created a problem that would have been absurd to our ancestors. With produce being shipped from all over the world, it’s difficult to tell what is actually in season near you. Locavore (2.99) tells you what is currently in season in your region so that you can make purchasing decisions that reduce your carbon footprint. It also provides recipes that use all in-season ingredients and shows you nearby farmers markets where you can buy those ingredients. If you connect the app to your FacebookFacebook account, you can share where you came across especially stellar local produce and read what other people near you have discovered. The jury is still out on the health and environmental impact of genetically modified food like the “botox apple,” but genetically modified (GMO) foods still go unlabeled and are difficult to avoid. The Center for Food Safety, which runs campaigns to halt the approval of GMO foods, has iPhoneiPhone and AndroidAndroid apps that help shoppers identify genetically modified food. The app gives the low-down on the approval statuses of GMO items in major food groups and highlights tips for avoiding GMO foods in general. As the title indicates, this app from the Pesticide Action Network helps you figure out what pesticides are on your food before you buy it. According to the app, an apple has a potential 42 residues, for instance. The app comes with a helpful chart if you want to know which ones are neurotoxins, hormone disruptors, carcinogens, or developmental or reproductive toxins. Though by that point, you might already be standing in the organic section. Like the Locavore app, Seasons (1.99) helps consumers buy products that are in-season in their region. In addition to fruits and vegetables, it also keeps track of herbs, nuts and mushrooms broken down by whether they’re in-season, at the start of their season, at the end of their season or produced year-round in your area. Each food includes a graph that shows both import and local seasons. Because many consumers prefer environmentally conscious options when available, companies are eager to label their products as such. In some cases, however, the labels are more indicative of greenwashing than of reduced environmental impact. Shoppers can use Label Lookup to understand what 169 different green labels mean and how reliable they are. “GMO-Free,” for instance, is too vague to be reliable. “American Grassfed,” however, is thirdy-party verified and meets detailed standards. Whether or not you’re a vegetarian, reducing the amount of meat that you eat can reduce the impact your diet has on the environment. And it doesn’t need to be painful; you can easily find great vegan, vegetarian and vegetarian-friendly restaurants using mobile app VegOut (2.99). The app is powered by happycow.net, a vegetarian-friendly restaurant search engine with more than 13,000 listings around the world. It uses your location to show you the restaurants nearest you, but you can also search by zipcode if you’re planning to dine elsewhere. - 10 Free iPhone Apps to Help You Go Green for Earth Day - 10 Great iPhone Apps for Growing a Garden - 6 Essential Android Apps for Business Travel - 5 Excellent E-Card iPhone Apps - 10 Mobile Apps for Movie Addicts Image courtesy of iStockphotoiStockphoto, Jasmina007 What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article talks about 7 mobile apps that can help you make environmentally friendly eating choices.

Article: Though there are about 400 languages from all over the world that are in danger of disappearing completely, Zoque-Ayapaneco, a native Mexican language is considered the most likely to become extinct, because the only two people in the world that speak it fluently do not talk to each other! And, it's not because they live in different countries, states or even villages. In fact, Manuel Segovia and Isidro Velazquez, both in their 70s, live within 500 yards of each other, in the village of Ayapa in the Southern Mexican State of Tabasco. They, however, refuse to communicate because they simply don't have much in common. Segovia is apparently a little flank in nature while Velazquez is described as shy. Segovia was at least able to talk in Zoque-Ayapanece with his brother until he passed away about 12 years ago, and still manages to practice it with his family, especially his son Manuel, who for the last five years has been trying to learn it and hopes to become fluent enough to teach it to the next generation. Velazquez on the other hand, has not been heard speaking in the language with anybody. The two men say the language used to be widely spoken in the village, but the younger generation _ it for fear of being laughed at, and it therefore began to die a slow death, as the elders passed away. Unless the two men get their acts together, the only way to hear the language will be to either listen to Manuel's not-so-fluent statement or see them talk in a documentary entitled \\"Lengua Muerta\\" (Dead Language) that is being filmed to capture Zoque Ayapaneco and 364 other native Mexican languages that are in a similar state. We sure hope Segovia and Velazquez soon find something common to talk about. Maybe the fact is that the language is dying and that they should start encouraging and teaching the next generation together. Question: The reason why Segovia and Velazquez don't talk to each other is that _ . Options: A: they both are too shy B: they live in different villages C: they are too familiar to talk D: they have no similarity in their character Answer:","output":"D: they have no similarity in their character"},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: All living things on the earth need other living things to live. Nothing lives alone. Most animals must live in a group, and even a plant grows close together with others of the same kind. Sometimes one living thing kills another, one eats and the other is eaten. Each kind of life eats another kind of life in order to live, and together they create a food chain . Some food chains are simple, while others are not. But all food chains begin with the sun, and all food chains become broken up if one of the links disappears. All life needs sunlight to live on. But only plants can use sunlight directly. Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals. Meat-eating animals are only eating plants indirectly. What about humans? We are members of many food chains. We eat rice, vegetables, and fruits and so on. We also eat meat and drink milk. But we often break up the food chains. We kill wild animals and also make rivers, lakes and seas polluted. When these rivers, lakes and seas are polluted, the fish in them can not be eaten. If we eat the fish, we will get strange illnesses. Each form of life is linked to all others. Breaking the links puts all life in danger.

Ethnic clashes last month left at least 300 people dead and threatened to revive a civil war that has killed tens of thousands. A 12,000-strong UN mission in South Sudan was unable to prevent attacks. The announcement was made by the East African regional body, Igad, and confirmed by South Sudan cabinet minister Dr Martin Elia Lomuro. President Salva Kiir had previously dismissed the idea of an additional force. The proposal for a new unit in South Sudan was backed by the African Union and discussed at a meeting in Ethiopia of Igad - the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. But much of the details of the force remain unclear. Igad sources have suggested a new force should have a more far-reaching mandate than the existing peacekeeping mission. But after the meeting, South Sudan's Minister of Cabinet Affairs Martin Elia Lomuro told the BBC further talks were needed to discuss the mandate, size and timeline for any force. Correspondents say the group of soldiers from different African countries is likely to be modelled on a similar unit deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo to combat rebels from the M23 group. Last week, President Kiir removed Riek Machar as first vice-president, two weeks after the rival leaders' forces clashed in the capital. The two had backed a peace deal signed in the wake of violence in recent years. In the wake of the latest fighting, Mr Machar's spokesman told AFP news agency that \\"the only hope is a protection force\\". The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza, reporting from the region, said it was also agreed at the Igad meeting that the newly appointed vice-president, Taban Deng, would step down from his position if Mr Machar agreed to return to Juba to rejoin the transitional government. Mr Machar had previously said he would stay away unless a neutral African force was deployed there. South Sudan became independent from Sudan in 2011 but its short history has been marred by civil war. Summary:","output":"The East African regional body, Igad, confirmed by South Sudan's cabinet minister, announced a proposal for a new peacekeeping force in South Sudan, necessitated by escalating ethnic conflict, despite previous dismissal of additional forces by President Salva Kiir, with details on the mandate, size, and timeline of the force yet to be finalized."},{"instruction":"How is \\"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, my political group.\\" said in Romanian?","output":"In order to translate the given sentence into Romanian, I will analyze the given text and perform the translation step by step. 1.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did the Republican National Committee set up the website lyincomey.com?

Energiakademiet.dk, an energy academy that focuses on renewable energy solutions, recognizes the importance of understanding and addressing these concerns for the future. As such, a detailed examination of the future commons and their implications is warranted, with key elements being the environmental impact, social equity, economic viability, political support, and technological advancements. 1. Environmental impact As we progress into an era dominated by climate change and dwindling natural resources, it is crucial to adopt sustainable approaches that focus on preserving the environment. The future commons need to be designed and managed in such a way that they reduce pollution, increase energy efficiency, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This involves shifting the dependency from non-renewable energy sources to renewables, such as solar, wind, and hydro, and incorporating eco-friendly practices for housing, transportation, and manufacturing, among others. 2. Social equity The management of future commons should take into account the varying needs of different communities. Accessibility and affordability are crucial factors to ensure that every individual benefits from the sustainability measures. This entails the reinforcement of social equity by implementing policies focused on reducing income disparities, promoting gender equality, and assuring equitable access to basic services, like clean water, sanitation, and housing. Empowering local communities to participate in decision-making processes is also essential for the successful management of the commons. 3. Economic viability Although developing and implementing sustainable solutions often comes with increased costs, it is vital to consider long-term gains, such as improved resource management, job creation, and overall economic growth. Investments in future commons should prioritize solutions that are financially feasible and economically viable. With this in mind, the implementation of innovative public-private partnerships can contribute significantly to driving the development and adoption of economically sustainable practices while ensuring wealth generation for all stakeholders. 4. Political support Strong political backing is essential to enforce policies and frameworks that foster the development of future commons. Public support for new, sustainable solutions can be leveraged by emphasizing the multitude of benefits, such as lower energy consumption, reduced carbon footprints, and better public health outcomes. Advocating for greater political commitment to global environmental goals, such as the Paris Agreement, underscores the importance of international cooperation in addressing climate change and resource management. 5. Technological advancements Fostering innovation in the technology sector is paramount to shaping the future commons. Groundbreaking technologies, from energy storage systems to electric vehicles, can radically transform resource management and contribute to mitigating environmental impacts. In addition, digital platforms such as blockchain can promote transparency and security in natural resource management. Encouraging research and development across relevant technologies, while supporting initiatives that share knowledge and expertise, can accelerate the transition to a more sustainable future. In conclusion, the future commons — as envisioned by Energiakademiet.dk — revolve around striking a balance between environmental considerations, social equity, economic viability, political support, and technological advancements. By thoughtfully addressing these core elements, stakeholders and societies worldwide can work towards building a sustainable future that benefits all."},{"instruction":"Question: Driving a car along a scenic highway can have what calming affect?

Options: - intense pleasure - period of rest - babies - conversation - skin irritation Explain why a human would choose \\"period of rest\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"period of rest\\" to answer the question above because it is the most logical and contextually appropriate option among the given choices, considering the information provided. The question describes a couple who had been copulating seemingly non-stop. Copulation is a physically demanding activity, requiring energy and stamina. As with any other continuous physical activity, the human body would eventually need a break to recover and restore its energy levels. Here's a brief explanation of why the other options may not be chosen as the most suitable answer: 1. Intense pleasure: While copulating may lead to intense pleasure, it does not necessarily occur after non-stop copulation. Pleasure can be experienced throughout the process, making it less likely to be the direct result of the non-stop copulation described in the question. 2. Babies: Although copulation may result in conception, it's important to note that it usually takes a significant amount of time (around 9 months in humans) for a baby to be born after conception. Furthermore, the question is mainly focused on the immediate scenario (non-stop copulation), so the most appropriate answer should relate to the consequences stemming directly from that situation. 3. Conversation: While it is possible for a couple to have a conversation after they have been copulating, it is not the most natural result of non-stop copulation. The human body would be physically exhausted after this intense activity, making a period of rest more logical. 4. Skin irritation: Repeated or prolonged skin contact during copulation might cause irritation; however, this is not innately connected with the activity and recovery cycle of the human body. Rest would be the most immediate need after non-stop copulation. Hence, a \\"period of rest\\" is the most appropriate answer in this context, as it indicates the natural response and requirement of the human body to recover from an exhausting physical activity."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

As his opponent bidder and henchman ambush him for the stone, he deftly defends it. Once Flynn has won the duel, he proceeds to his hotel lobby, hoping to repair his relationship with his girlfriend, only to find that she has abandoned him after a string of disappointments. Meanwhile, in Carpathia, a group of former KGB agents led by Sergei Kubichek (Dikran Tulaine), nostalgic for the defunct Soviet Union, have hatched a plot to resurrect the famous vampire, Prince Vlad Dracula, in order to create an army of invincible undead soldiers. Having secured the corpse in the tomb, they only need to secure a historical item, the \\"Judas Chalice\\", to ensure that they can resurrect and control him. To this effect, they travel to Bucharest and kidnap Professor Lazlo (Bruce Davison), a genius historian with a penchant for vampire lore, who has been searching for the chalice for years. The former agents cajole the crippled professor, who half-heartedly joins them. Using a handful of scrolls created by French monks, Professor Lazlo deduces that there is a marker that partially gives the location of the chalice in New Orleans.

Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which cousin learned more about predators with no natural predators? Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","output":"Answer: Liam learned more about predators with no natural predators since he was reading about apex predators which, by definition, do not have natural predators."},{"instruction":"Write some highlights for the following article: By. Martin Robinson. PUBLISHED:. 03:20 EST, 25 July 2012. |. UPDATED:. 04:36 EST, 25 July 2012. Peers seem to have forgotten Britain is suffering a deep double dip recession after splurging £175,000 on new artworks last year. Official House of Lords figures show that tens of thousands has been spent on sculptures, paintings and silverware during the spending spree. The £175,000 is almost ten times more than spent a year earlier because it includes a £108,000 blow out on fresh artwork for the peers' new offices in Millbank next to Parliament. Additions to the giant House of Lords art collection include a £7,500 portrait of suffragette Viscountess Rhondda, who fought for the rights of women to vote, by Alice Mary Burton. Splurge: A bust of Prince Philip, left, and a portrait of Lady Rhondda, right, have taken their places in the House of Lords giant art collection as part of a £175,000 spending spree. There was also £25,200 splashed out on a silver piece by British maker Brett Payne. Another £8,500 was laid out on a bust of Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, and a £5,000 painting of Queen Victoria's Jubilee procession by Robert Weir Allan. Peers get around £50,000 a year in grants from Government departments to add to the 8,000 pieces of Parliament art on display and in storage. But they can opt to save up the money over several years and go on a huge spending spree. The Lords has been able to build up artworks since the 17th century, and has bought up major pieces throughout the centuries to the present, with some art around 1,000 years old. 'The House of Lords works of art budget for purchases has been halved from £50,000 in 2010/11 to £25,000 in 2011/12. There will be no grant in 2012/13,' a House of Lords spokesman told MailOnline. 'In September 2011 the House of Lords opened a large new office block in Milbank House. A separate grant of £135,000 was provided to purchase works of art for the new building. 'This was a one-off expenditure which will not be repeated. Peers: The House of Lords and Parliament has a collection of at least 8,000 artworks worth millions. 'The House of Lords art collection is a public collection and much of it is on view to the public on tours of the Palace of Westminster. It can also be viewed online on the Parliament website.' But the spending pales in comparison to the Coalition's plans to reform the House of Lords, which will cost taxpayers nearly half a billion pounds, it has been claimed. Labour peer and economist Lord Lipsey put the estimated cost of running a fully-elected chamber over five years at £484million, enough to fund 15,000 nurses' salaries. It is £7million more than the previous estimates and more than five times the £91million cost of the existing House of Lords in the last five years, according to the peer. Highlights:","output":"1. Despite experiencing a deep double dip recession, the House of Lords spent £175,000 on new artworks last year. 2. The figure is nearly ten times more than the previous year largely due to a £108,000 expenditure on new artwork for peers' new offices in Millbank. 3.

Since no options were provided, I will evaluate two common ingredients: baby-safe soap and an essential oil. Option 1: Baby-safe soap Step 1: Assess the purpose of adding baby-safe soap to reusable baby wipes - Baby-safe soap is gentle on a baby's sensitive skin while providing a cleaning effect. - It helps remove dirt, grime, and any remnants on the baby's skin. Step 2: Evaluate safety concerns - Baby-safe soap is specially formulated with a mild balance of ingredients to make sure it doesn't cause any issues for the baby's skin. - It is typically free from harsh chemicals and fragrances, reducing the risk of irritation. Step 3: Consider the convenience - Baby-safe soap is readily available in stores and can be easily mixed with water. Option 2: Essential oil Step 1: Assess the purpose of adding essential oil to reusable baby wipes - Essential oils can provide a pleasant smell and have some known antibacterial properties. - However, not all essential oils are safe for use on baby's skin. Step 2: Evaluate safety concerns - Some essential oils can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in babies, even when diluted. - It is important to research and choose baby-safe oils and dilute them properly before adding them to the baby wipes. Step 3: Consider the convenience - Essential oils need to be used with caution, and care must be taken to acquire baby-safe oils and understand the proper dilution ratios. After evaluating both options: Option 1: Baby-safe soap appears to be the better solution because it is designed specifically for a baby's sensitive skin, provides a cleaning effect, and is readily available. Option 2: Essential oil might be a good addition for its scent and antibacterial properties; however, it requires more caution and research to ensure proper use and safety for the baby. In conclusion, adding baby-safe soap to your reusable baby wipes is a safer and more convenient solution to achieve your goal of providing a gentle cleaning effect for your baby's skin."},{"instruction":"Give the rationale and then the answer. Claim: \\"Freshly harvested vegetables are the best source for obtaining low fat Butter.\\" Is the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search? Options: - yes - no","output":"Rationale: The claim states that \\"Freshly harvested vegetables are the best source for obtaining low fat Butter.\\" Firstly, butter is a dairy product made from the fat and protein components of milk or cream. It does not come from vegetables. While vegetables are indeed a source of many nutrients and vitamins, they do not produce butter. Secondly, the term \\"low fat butter\\" refers to a product that has a reduced fat content compared to regular butter. This type of product is usually not derived from vegetables as well. Low-fat butter is typically made by reducing the fat content in regular butter or by adding other ingredients to mimic the consistency and taste of butter while containing less fat. Although there are plant-based substitutes for butter, such as margarine, these are not the same thing as low-fat butter.

Possible answers: -- unacceptable. -- acceptable....I think the answer is","output":"acceptable. A linguist would likely rate this sentence as linguistically acceptable. This is because, despite the presence of both a negative particle (\\"not\\") and an interrogative form (\\"Did\\"), the sentence follows standard rules of English grammar and syntax. When assessing the acceptability of a given sentence, linguists typically consider factors such as grammaticality, well-formedness, and communicative efficiency. In the sentence \\"Did Sue not pass her exam?\\", the subject (\\"Sue\\") is positioned between the auxiliary verb \\"did\\" and the negation \\"not.\\" Since the phrase \\"not pass\\" is a negated form of the verb \\"to pass,\\" it is syntactically correct to place this after the subject. The auxiliary verb \\"did\\" is used to form interrogative sentences in the past simple tense, further reinforcing the sentence's legitimacy according to standard English grammar rules. Additionally, the sentence is well-formed and efficiently communicates the intended meaning. A listener or reader can readily understand that the speaker is asking whether Sue failed her exam. While the sentence could be cast in an alternative format, such as \\"Didn't Sue pass her exam?\\", the version in question remains intelligible and adheres to the grammatical structure expected of a question in the English language. In conclusion, a linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"Did Sue not pass her exam?\\" as linguistically acceptable. It follows established grammar and syntax conventions and is both well-formed and communicative. Although negative and interrogative elements can sometimes lead to ambiguity or awkwardness, this sentence successfully conveys its intended meaning without compromising linguistic standards."},{"instruction":"Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What part of the church did Nikolova consider unsuitable for the baptism? The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda.

Running shoes are highly technical footwear. The provide stability while bearing up to three times the wearer's body weight. But it's not easy to find the right pair. Finding the right running shoes is something of an art, or a science and a feel. The science part begins with the shape of the arch of your foot, which anyone can find out at home with this quick experiment: Put your foot in water and place it on a piece of brown paper. If you see a \\"C\\" shape on the paper when you remove your foot, you have a rare high arch. If the shape looks more like a rectangle, that means you have flat feet. See something in between? That's a normal arch. Conveniently for shoppers, shoe companies nowadays divide their shoes in three categories: neutral ( for high arches), stability ( for normal or low arches) and motion control (for flat arches). So you'll know which type suits you. At this point, most people would just grab an appealing shoe and try it on, But professionals would do a few quality-control tests. First, you bend the shoe toe to heel to see where it bends. If it's not at the forefoot---where the foot actually be bends, be afraid. Then you grip both ends and twist in opposite directions. If you can twist it like a tower, it means there's zero support. Finally, you squeeze he heel in both directions. A stable heel won't _ . Now you need to check the mold that shapes the inside of the shoe: whether its wide or narrow in the mid-foot, how it sits on the heel and how roomy the toe box is. It's wise to make the shoe purchase in the late afternoon, to allow for any swelling that your feet do throughout the day. Toes also decide sizing choices. The rule is that you need a finger's width from your longest toe (whether that's your big one or not) to the end of the shoe. A:","output":"Based on the article, which of the following is the correct sequence to find the right pair of running shoes: A) Check the shape of your foot arch, determine the category of running shoe, perform quality-control tests, and analyze the shoe's mold and sizing B) Analyze the shoe's mold and sizing, determine the category of running shoe, check the shape of your foot arch, and perform quality-control tests C) Perform quality-control tests, determine the category of running shoe, analyze the shoe's mold and sizing, and check the shape of your foot arch D) Determine the category of running shoe, perform quality-control tests, check the shape of your foot arch, and analyze the shoe's mold and sizing"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - GloboNews is the news television channel of Grupo Globo , which is the first 24 - hour news channel on Brazilian television .

Options: - cabin in the woods - california - front yard - conservatory - tropical forest Let's think step by step:","output":"A personal Ficus, also known as a Ficus tree, can be adaptable to various environments as long as certain growth conditions are met. Here is an analysis of how well a Ficus could thrive in each of the options: 1. Cabin in the woods: A Ficus tree can grow here, provided it receives adequate light. Many Ficus species need bright, indirect sunlight to grow but can tolerate some shade. The cabin would need to have ample windows or skylights to meet this requirement. Additionally, you should consider the temperature and humidity of the woods. Most Ficus trees prefer a humid environment and a temperature range of 60-75°F (15-24°C). 2. California: California's diverse landscape would likely be suitable for a Ficus tree. Depending on the species, Ficus trees can be planted outdoors or kept as a houseplant. In temperate coastal areas, the Ficus tree can be planted outside, where it can receive full sun or partial shade. For inland regions where the climate is drier, you might need to provide extra humidity, such as by misting the leaves or placing a tray of water near the plant if grown indoors. 3. Front yard: As long as the climate and environmental conditions are suitable, a personal Ficus tree can be planted in the front yard. Many species can survive in a wide range of temperatures and sunlight exposure levels. However, you should consider potential temperature fluctuations in the winter months, as Ficus trees are sensitive to freezing temperatures. 4. Conservatory: A Ficus tree can thrive in a conservatory or greenhouse, as these spaces provide the humidity and consistent temperature that many Ficus species need. It is essential to monitor the sunlight exposure, opting for bright but indirect sunlight to avoid scorching the leaves. Proper air circulation is also crucial to prevent diseases and pests. 5. Tropical forest: Many Ficus species are native to tropical rainforests, so a tropical forest environment can be highly conducive to their growth. In this option, the plant would receive ample humidity, warmth, and natural sunlight. However, personal care and cultivation in such an environment may be more challenging due to the vastness and unpredictability of natural forests. In conclusion, the best environment for a personal Ficus would depend on the specific species and its environmental preferences. California or a conservatory would likely provide the most suitable and controlled environments for growing a Ficus tree while ensuring the plant receives proper care."},{"instruction":"Select your answer: Which is this about?

The series originated from \\"Frog Baseball\\", a 1992 short film by Judge originally aired on Liquid Television. After seeing the short, MTV signed Judge to develop the concept. The series first ran from March 8, 1993 to November 28, 1997. In 1996, the series was adapted into the animated feature film \\"Beavis and Butt-Head Do America\\". Over a decade later, the show was renewed for an eighth season which aired in late 2011. Mike Judge has stated that he wants to try to get \\"Beavis and Butt-Head\\" back on MTV or another network. - Cannibal Corpse is an American death metal band from Buffalo, New York. Formed in December 1988, the band has released thirteen studio albums, two box sets, four video albums and two live albums. The band has had little radio or television exposure throughout its career, although a cult following began to build after the release of the 1991 album \\"Butchered at Birth\\", and 1992 album \\"Tomb of the Mutilated\\". As of 2015, they had achieved worldwide sales of two million units for combined sales of all their albums, making them the top-selling death metal band of all time. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played. - Gateways to Annihilation is the sixth studio album by the death metal band Morbid Angel . This album saw a change in musical style as the speed - laden intensity of the previous album Formulas Fatal to the Flesh was abandoned for a slower , more droning style , reminiscent of Blessed Are the Sick . This is also the first album in which Steve Tucker contributed lyrics and music to the band . Dan Seagrave painted the album cover . This marks the first Morbid Angel album cover he had painted since Altars of Madness . - Morbid Angel is an American death metal band based in Tampa, Florida. The band was one of the original death metal bands signed to Earache Records, and was also influential in the transition of death metal from its thrash metal roots to its current form by incorporating guttural vocals, up-tempo blast beats, atonality in guitar soloing, and dark, chunky, mid-paced rhythms. They have been described as one of \\"the most influential and emulated bands in death metal\\", alongside Cannibal Corpse, and have been cited as an influence by many later bands. They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to Giant Records in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song \\"God of Emptiness\\" shown on an episode of \\"Beavis and Butt-head\\". Their first four albums are considered classics in the genre. - Earache Records is an independent record label based in Nottingham, England and New York, United States. It helped to pioneer extreme metal by releasing many of the earliest grindcore and death metal records between 1988 and 1994. - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk. - A blast beat is a drum beat that originated in hardcore punk and grindcore, and is often associated with extreme metal and more recently black metal and thrash. It is utilised by many different styles of metal. In Adam MacGregor's definition, \\"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the bass drum, snare, and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\\" Blast beats have been described as, \\"maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence\\". - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Torture (from the Latin \\"tortus\\", \\"twisted\\") is the act of deliberately inflicting physical or psychological pain on an organism in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or compel some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture. - Dissection (from Latin ' \\"to cut to pieces\\"; also called anatomization), is the dismembering of the body of a deceased animal or plant to study its anatomical structure. Autopsy is used in pathology and forensic medicine to determine the cause of death in humans. It is carried out by or demonstrated to biology and anatomy students in high school and medical school. Less advanced courses typically focus on smaller subjects, such as small formaldehyde-preserved animals, while the more advanced courses normally use cadavers. Consequently, dissection is typically conducted in a morgue or in an anatomy lab.

To begin with, the reservation process was an absolute mess. Despite having called a week in advance to book a table for six, when we arrived, the hostess couldn't find our reservation. We had to wait an additional 30 minutes before a table was available. Not a great start to our evening. Once seated, the ambiance left something to be desired. The lighting was far too bright, creating a harsh and overly exposed environment, while the music was so loud and discordant that we could barely hear one another converse. This made our dining experience incredibly uncomfortable and far from the relaxing evening we had anticipated. As we tried to place our order, we found our waiter to be inattentive, bordering on rude. It took him 15 minutes to bring us the menus, and he seemed oddly unfamiliar with the menu items, despite our basic questions about the dishes. His forgetfulness was frustrating as well, having to ask multiple times for simple things like refilling our water glasses or to bring more bread. It was evident that he was either poorly trained or completely disinterested in his job. Now, let's talk about the food. According to XYZ Restaurant's website and multiple reviews, their cuisine is \\"farm-to-table\\" and \\"innovatively fresh.\\" Well, my experience was quite the opposite. The Caesar salad we ordered as an appetizer was completely drowned in dressing which overpowered the taste of the lettuce and other ingredients. A real disappointment. Our main courses followed suit. My rib-eye steak was overcooked and tough, with the fat poorly trimmed. The accompanying asparagus was undercooked; the seasoning was nonexistent, and the presentation was unappealing, piled haphazardly onto the plate. My wife had the pan-seared salmon, which was equally disappointing. It was dry, overcooked, and served with a bland and watery lemon dill sauce. The accompanying garlic mashed potatoes tasted as if they came from a box – hardly the fresh, bursting flavors we had been promised. To top it all off, the final straw was the ridiculously high prices. It took a great deal of effort not to scoff when handed the bill. For the abysmal quality of food and service we received, it felt like a slap in the face to be charged such exorbitant prices. In summary, our experience at XYZ Restaurant was nothing short of a disaster, from the reservation mishap to the cacophonous ambiance, apathetic service, and subpar cuisine. We will most certainly not be returning, and I would strongly recommend that others avoid this establishment as well. It is truly a disgrace to have such a sad excuse for a restaurant tarnish an otherwise lovely evening out."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - In information theory , Shannon 's source coding theorem ( or noiseless coding theorem ) establishes the limits to possible data compression , and the operational meaning of the Shannon entropy . The source coding theorem shows that ( in the limit , as the length of a stream of independent and identically - distributed random variable ( i.i.d . ) data tends to infinity ) it is impossible to compress the data such that the code rate ( average number of bits per symbol ) is less than the Shannon entropy of the source , without it being virtually certain that information will be lost . However it is possible to get the code rate arbitrarily close to the Shannon entropy , with negligible probability of loss . The source coding theorem for symbol codes places an upper and a lower bound on the minimal possible expected length of codewords as a function of the entropy of the input word ( which is viewed as a random variable ) and of the size of the target alphabet . - Ecology (from , \\"house\\", or \\"environment\\"; -, \\"study of\\") is the scientific analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology, geography, and Earth science. Ecology includes the study of interactions organisms have with each other, other organisms, and with abiotic components of their environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), and number (population) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. Biodiversity, which refers to the varieties of species, genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem services. - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968. - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on or to heat the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton. - The Boltzmann constant (or ), which is named after Ludwig Boltzmann, is a physical constant relating the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the temperature of the gas. It is the gas constant divided by the Avogadro constant : - In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding. - A temperature is an objective comparative measurement of hot or cold. It is measured by a thermometer. Several scales and units exist for measuring temperature, the most common being Celsius (denoted °C; formerly called \\"centigrade\\"), Fahrenheit (denoted °F), and, especially in science, Kelvin (denoted K). - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - Natural language processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humancomputer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve: natural language understanding, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input; and others involve natural language generation. - In statistical thermodynamics, entropy (usual symbol ) (Greek:, + ) is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations that a thermodynamic system can have when in a state as specified by certain macroscopic variables. Specifically, assuming that each of the microscopic configurations is equally probable, the entropy of the system is the natural logarithm of that number of configurations, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant (which provides consistency with the original thermodynamic concept of entropy discussed below, and gives entropy the dimension of energy divided by temperature). Formally, - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Now this theory has found applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. - In data mining, anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset. Typically the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. - Signal processing is an enabling technology that encompasses the fundamental theory, applications, algorithms, and implementations of processing or transferring information contained in many different physical, symbolic, or abstract formats broadly designated as \\"signals\\". It uses mathematical, statistical, computational, heuristic, and linguistic representations, formalisms, and techniques for representation, modelling, analysis, synthesis, discovery, recovery, sensing, acquisition, extraction, learning, security, or forensics. - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.

KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family.

The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. Where will Trump send the National Guard to protect the US from drug smuggling?

Let's add 162 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 162 = i - 162 + 165 + 162 Now, 0 + 162 equals 162, and -162 + 162 equals 0, so the equation becomes: 162 = i + 0 + 165 Since we have a 0 in there, it doesn't change anything.

(Supplied) An imprisoned Belgian serial rapist and murderer whose wish to die was previously granted by doctors, will not be euthanised following a fresh medical decision. Frank Van Den Bleeken, who has spent 26 years in jail for repeated rapes and a rape-murder, will be moved from his prison in the northwestern city of Bruges to a new psychiatric treatment centre in Ghent, Justice Minister Koen Geens said in a statement on Tuesday. Geens \\"takes note of the decision of doctors treating Mr Frank Van Den Bleeken to no longer continue the euthanasia procedure,\\" the minister said in a statement. He gave no reason for the decision, citing medical privacy. The Flemish-language newspaper De Morgen reported at the weekend that Van Den Bleeken would be euthanised in Bruges prison on January 11. Van Den Bleeken had for years requested that the state help him end his life due to what his lawyer Jos Vander Velpen called \\"unbearable\\" psychological suffering. He won approval in September.

The question asks where one could purchase an old pie safe with decorative tin. The options provided are shopping bag, trash, antique store, landfill, and cupboard. Step 2: Eliminate clearly irrelevant options. Shopping bags are used to carry items after purchase and not a place to buy items, while trash and landfill are places to discard unwanted items. These three options are not suitable for purchasing an old pie safe with decorative tin. Step 3: Consider the remaining options relative to the question. Between the remaining options, antique store and cupboard, it's important to consider which place is more likely to sell an old pie safe with decorative tin. Step 4: Identify the more appropriate option. An antique store is a place where people buy and sell vintage, unique, and often valuable items. Antique stores specialize in older items that have historical or sentimental value. An old pie safe with decorative tin would fit well within this category, making it the most logical option to find and purchase one. On the other hand, a cupboard is a type of storage furniture, usually used within a household setting for storing items like dishes, glassware, and sometimes food.

It just has a lot less to show for it. According to a CNN analysis of congressional records that looked at bills that became law and the number of days lawmakers worked, members of the House have spent more than 150 days and Senate just over 140 days in session so far, comparable to previous Congresses at this point in the term. But of the thousands of measures introduced, only 132 passed both. About one-fifth of those measures were to approve official names for post offices.

To date, members of the House have spent more than 150 days in session, while the Senate has spent just over 140 days. These numbers are comparable to the amount of time that previous Congresses have worked at this point in their terms. However, the productivity of this Congress has been notably lower, with only 132 measures passed by both chambers out of the thousands that were introduced. In contrast, during a previous Congress, the House worked for a total of 286 days, while the Senate was in session for 349 days. This indicates that the current Congress is on a similar trajectory with respect to the number of working days. Despite this similarity in time spent working, the number of bills that have become law is much lower for the current Congress. Furthermore, it is worth noting that about one-fifth of the measures passed by this Congress were only to approve official names for post offices, which points to a focus on less significant legislation. There are several potential reasons for the current Congress' lower legislative productivity compared to its predecessors. One contributing factor could be the increased polarization and partisanship in the U.S. political landscape, which can make it more challenging for lawmakers to reach consensus on important legislation. Additionally, external factors, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may have affected Congress' ability to focus on and pass a wider array of bills. Lastly, a focus on impeachment proceedings or other high-profile investigations may have consumed both time and attention, further reducing legislative productivity. In conclusion, CNN's analysis of congressional records demonstrates that the current Congress has worked a similar number of days as previous Congresses at this point in their terms, but has passed far fewer measures. This reduction in legislative productivity could be due to a variety of factors, ranging from the increased polarization in American politics to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is important to recognize that comparing the number of days worked between Congresses does not provide a full picture of their varying levels of efficiency and effectiveness, it is clear that the current Congress stands out for its lower legislative accomplishments."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A large black man with a beard and a smaller framed white male with a receding hair line are professionally dressed and having a conversation while a woman stands looking away in the background.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The men are on the phone with each other.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Modern generations tend to believe there is something wrong with them if they rent. However, is high home-ownership really as rosy as people imagine? Staring at data first, we realize that the most successful, stable, attractive country in the Western world is Switzerland. It has tiny unemployment; wealth; high happiness and mental-health scores. Does it have high home-ownership rates? Absolutely not. In Switzerland, about seven in ten of the population are renters. Yet, with Europe's lowest home-ownership rate, the nation thrives. Now go to the other end of the misery distribution. Spain has approximately the highest home-ownership rate in Europe (at more than 80%). But one-quarter of its population are unemployed. A likely reason is that high levels of home-ownership mess up the labour market. In a sensibly functioning economy it is easy for people to move around to drop into the vibrant job slots thrown up by technological change. With a high degree of owner-occupation, everything slows. Folk get stuck. Renters can go to new jobs. In that way they do the economy a favour. As Friedman said, the rate of unemployment depends on the flexibility of the housing market. Next we come to economic breakdown. Most analysts accept that at heart it was the housing market--obsessive pursuit of homes, the engendered mortgage lending and an unavoidable house-price crash--that sank the Western world. Germany, say, with its more efficient rental market, had a far smoother ride through trouble. As for the monetary system, in the past few decades, in the hope of getting untaxed capital gains way above their true labour earnings, many people threw their spare cash into buying larger houses or building extra bedrooms.

Let's begin with Venezuela. Step 1: Find the main imports and exports of Venezuela After researching, I found that Venezuela's main exports are petroleum, refined petroleum products, and gold. Its main imports include medicine, vehicles, machinery, electronics, and food. Now let's compare Venezuela's industry with Haiti's and Peru's: Step 2: Compare the industries of Venezuela and Haiti Venezuela has vast oil reserves and relies heavily on its oil exports. In contrast, Haiti has a weaker economy and limited natural resources. Haiti's main industries include agriculture, textiles, and construction materials. Thus, there is a significant difference between the industries of Venezuela and Haiti. Step 3: Compare the industries of Venezuela and Peru Peru's main industries include mining (such as copper, silver, gold, and zinc), agriculture, and textiles. Although both Venezuela and Peru have natural resources, their industries differ since Peru has a more varied economy and does not rely solely on oil exports.

Question 2: What are the main imports and exports of Venezuela, and how does Venezuela's industry compare to Peru's? These questions are similar, as they both ask about Venezuela's main imports and exports and compare its industry with another country.

The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. - Boulogne-sur-Mer (Latin: \\"Gesoriacum\\" or \\"Bononia\\"), often called Boulogne, is a city in Northern France.

The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic. Sparkeion flirts with his former fiancée, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis. In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back. Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter. All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis. Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods. Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them. They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth.

Your task is to generate label \\"yes\\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \\"no\\". Q: Abstract: Diverse epidemiological factors are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prevalence in different populations. However, the global landscape of the genetic changes in HCC genomes underpinning different epidemiological and ancestral backgrounds still remains uncharted. Here a collection of data from 503 liver cancer genomes from different populations uncovered 30 candidate driver genes and 11 core pathway modules. Furthermore, a collaboration of two large-scale cancer genome projects comparatively analyzed the trans-ancestry substitution signatures in 608 liver cancer cases and identified unique mutational signatures that predominantly contribute to Asian cases. This work elucidates previously unexplored ancestry-associated mutational processes in HCC development. A combination of hotspot TERT promoter mutation, TERT focal amplification and viral genome integration occurs in more than 68% of cases, implicating TERT as a central and ancestry-independent node of hepatocarcinogenesis. Newly identified alterations in genes encoding metabolic enzymes, chromatin remodelers and a high proportion of mTOR pathway activations offer potential therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities..

The film features an extraordinary ensemble cast and is visually stunning. However, it falls short in engaging the audience emotionally, leaving them craving more depth in the storyline. The costumes and sets are beautifully designed, but the film's narrative structure leaves a lot to be desired. Review 2: Star-Studded Cast Can't Save a Flat Story Boasting an all-star cast led by Daniel Day-Lewis as the troubled filmmaker Guido Contini, \\"Nine\\" showcases impressive performances by Marion Cotillard, Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman, Judi Dench, Kate Hudson, and Sophia Loren. However, despite the stellar cast and some standout musical numbers, the film suffers from a disjointed narrative and an underdeveloped storyline that fails to captivate the viewer. Review 3: Between the Extravagant Musical Numbers, \\"Nine\\" Falls Short \\"Nine\\" is a visual treat, with extravagant musical numbers and lavish sets transporting the viewer to the glamour of Italy in the early '60s. It excels in showcasing the lavish world of Italian film. Yet, for a film that is supposed to explore the complex inner workings of a struggling artist, \\"Nine\\" falls short in connecting the audience to the emotional turmoil behind all the glitz and glam on the screen. Review 4: Well-choreographed Musical Numbers Struggle to Bring the Film Together \\"Nine\\", being a musical movie adaptation, features well-choreographed musical numbers with memorable tunes that hold the potential to entertain the viewers. However, as the film mostly lists to impress with set-pieces and grand spectacles, it struggles to stitch these sequences together coherently, leaving the audience feeling disjointed and disconnected from the central narrative. Review 5: A Cinematic Sensation That Promises More Than it Delivers The film adaptation of \\"Nine\\" is undeniably a cinematic sensation, filled with astonishing visuals, striking performances, and unforgettable choreography. Unfortunately, the movie fails to capture the emotional depth and supreme craftsmanship present in Federico Fellini's original, \\"8 1/2\\". While this version broadens the appeal with a more mainstream and contemporary approach, the result is a beautiful but hollow shell that struggles to evoke strong feelings from the viewers. Review 6: A Foray Into the Unknown That Misses the Mark \\"Nine\\" primarily follows Guido Contini, a revered filmmaker on a self-destructive downward spiral. The narrative succeeds in delving into the inner turmoil Guido faces but missteps in crafting character arcs for its female ensemble. Despite the powerful and dedicated performances by these leading ladies, we are left wanting a more rounded and developed picture of the women in Guido's life and the roles they play in the story. Review 7: Visually Impressive, Yet Lacking in Substance In conclusion, \\"Nine\\" (2009) is a visually impressive and glamorous film that highlights the golden era of Italian cinema. With a world-class cast and impeccable design, it should work wonders. However, the movie fails to provide a solid narrative and poignant emotional connections that would elevate it to the heights and legacy of Fellini's original film. In the end, the audience is left with a beautiful, yet empty, cinematic experience that promises more than it delivers."},{"instruction":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation? The history of Europe is very important as it is because it has affected us so much","output":"The correctly punctuated version of the given sentence should be: \\"The history of Europe is very important, as it is, because it has affected us so much.\\" Let's look deeper into the corrections: A comma was added after the word \\"important\\". In English, commas are often used to set off introductory elements or to separate clauses. In this context, it separates the main clause (\\"The history of Europe is very important\\") from the dependent clause (\\"as it is, because it has affected us so much\\"). Another comma was positioned after the phrase \\"as it is\\". However, there are different ways to punctuate this sentence depending on the intended meaning. One possibility could be: \\"The history of Europe is very important, as it is because it has affected us so much.\\" In this version, the phrase \\"as it is\\" is used as an intensifier for \\"very important\\". This sentence essentially implies that the current state of Europe's history is what makes it very important due to its substantial impact on us. Furthermore, it is worth noting that punctuation doesn't only clarify the syntax of a sentence -- it also guides the intonation, rhythm, and pause to be applied when reading it out loud. Hence, punctuation marks contribute substantially towards more effective and accurate communication."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that the jazzman tutors? is inside the article: As a young boy, after his mother dies, Rick Martin sees a trumpet in the window of a pawn shop.

This is like Earth's 24-hour day, which is the time it takes to rotate once around its axis. However, the unit of measurement (e.g., hours, minutes, or seconds) is not specified in the sentence, making it difficult to make any further comparisons or analysis. 3. Apoapsis: 440,756,000.0 kilometers The sentence also provides information regarding Lydia's apoapsis, which is the farthest point in its orbit from the central body it is orbiting around. The given apoapsis distance is measured in kilometers (km), making it easier to compare to other known objects in the solar system or even analyze its orbit shape. For instance, Earth's average distance from the Sun, also known as an astronomical unit (AU), is about 149.6 million kilometers. With Lydia's apoapsis being 440,756,000 kilometers, one could infer that its orbit is more elliptical or larger than Earth's orbit. From the aforementioned data, one can discern information about Lydia's motion, specifically its rotation and orbit. However, to accurately understand its orbit and rotation in relation to other known celestial objects, more information would be needed, such as the central body it revolves around, its full orbital parameters (like its perihelion, orbital period, and eccentricity), and the unit of measurement for its rotational period."},{"instruction":"Close two-man race for Romania #39;s presidency BUCHAREST, ROMANIA - Observers fear that vote tampering will mar results of Sunday #39;s presidential election in Romania.

I'm here today because I know that our future depends on connections like these among young people like you across the world. That's why when my husband and I travel abroad, we don't just visit palaces and parliaments and meet with heads of countries. We also come to schools like this one to meet with students like you, because we believe that relationships between countries aren't just about relationships between governments or leaders -- they're about relationships between people, particularly young people. So we view study abroad programs not just as an educational chance for students, but also as an active part of America's foreign policy . Through the wonders of modern technology, our world is more connected than ever before. Ideas can cross oceans with the click of a mouse. Companies can do business and _ with companies across the world. And we can text, email, Skype with people in the world. So studying abroad isn't just a fun way to spend a time of learning; it is quickly becoming the key to success in our times. Because getting ahead in today's workplaces isn't just about getting good grades or test scores in school, which are important. It's also about having real experience with the world beyond your borders -- experience with languages, cultures and societies very different from your own.

Identify the key components of the question 2. Research the topic to gather relevant information 3. Present a succinct answer based on the gathered information Step 1: Identifying Key Components The main components of the question are \\"absurd school of drama\\" and \\"who belongs.\\" Therefore, I need to find out which writers, playwrights, or artists are associated with the genre of absurd theatre. Step 2: Research the Topic I will research the absurd school of drama and its main contributors. After conducting research on this topic, I have found that the Theatre of the Absurd is a post-World War II movement in drama that focuses on the absurdity of human existence, often challenging the conventions of traditional theatre. Step 3: Present the Information Based on my research, here are some prominent writers and playwrights belonging to the Theatre of the Absurd: 1. Samuel Beckett: An Irish playwright, known for his plays like \\"Waiting for Godot\\" and \\"Endgame.\\" 2. Eugène Ionesco: A Romanian playwright, famous for plays like \\"The Bald Soprano\\" and \\"Rhinoceros.\\" 3. Jean Genet: A French writer, known for his works like \\"The Balcony\\" and \\"The Blacks.\\" 4. Harold Pinter: A British playwright, famous for plays such as \\"The Birthday Party\\" and \\"The Homecoming.\\" 5. Tom Stoppard: An English playwright, known for works like \\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.\\" These are just some of the many influential artists belonging to the absurd school of drama. The Theatre of the Absurd includes other writers and playwrights, but these five are among the most significant contributors."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Just over a dozen remain.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"About 36 still remain.\\"?","output":"The initial premise \\"Just over a dozen remain\\" does not entail the hypothesis \\"About 36 still remain\\" because a dozen refers to the number 12 in the English language, and when it is said, \\"just over a dozen,\\" it suggests a number slightly higher than 12, but still relatively close to 12. The term dozen is used to represent 12 of something, similar to how 'pair' is used to refer to 2 of something. The hypothesis \\"About 36 still remain,\\" however, refers to a significantly larger number. Even when considering a situation with some ambiguity or rounding, \\"about 36\\" would indicate a number close to 36, or thereabout, anything from roughly 34 to 38. This amount is far too high to be considered \\"just over a dozen,\\" which would likely represent a number in the range of 13-15 or 16 at most. Therefore, if the premise \\"Just over a dozen remain\\" is true, it does not give support to, or entail the hypothesis \\"About 36 still remain.\\" These two statements are referring to markedly different quantities. In logical reasoning, a premise entails a conclusion if, under all circumstances, it is impossible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false. Here, the premises and conclusion refer to different numbers, and it is possible for the premise to be true (13-15 items remaining) while the conclusion is false (not about 36 items remaining). This discrepancy is important, as the understanding of quantities indicated by these phrases could significantly alter perceptions and interpretations of a scenario. For example, in situations related to inventory management, population study, or data analysis, such misunderstandings over quantities could lead to misinformation or errors in decision-making. Hence, it's crucial to ascertain that a premise correctly entails a hypothesis. In this case, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Article: These days, most people in Britain and the US do not wear formal clothes. But sometimes it is important to wear the right thing. Many British people don't think about clothes very much. When they go out to enjoy themselves, they can wear almost anything. At theatres , cinemas and concerts you can put on anything you like: from beautiful suits and dresses to jeans and sweaters. Anything goes, as long as you look clean and tidy. But in Britain, as well as in the US, men in offices usually wear suits and ties and women wear dresses or skirts (not trousers). Doctors and business people always wear quite formal clothes. And in some hotels and restaurants men have to wear ties and women have to wear tidy dresses. In many ways, Americans are less formal than British people, but they are more careful with their clothes. At home, most Americans wear informal or sports clothes. But when they go out in the evening, they like to look nice. In good hotels and restaurants, men have to wear jackets and ties, and women have to wear pretty clothes. It is difficult to say exactly what people wear in Britain and the US, because everyone is different. If you are not sure what to wear, watch what other people do and then do the same. You'll feel good if you don't look too different from everyone else. Question: At concerts British business people wear _ .

Choices: - decomposition energy - reaction energy - positive energy - activation energy A: The answer to this question is:","output":"Activation Energy. Activation energy is the amount of energy that is required to initiate a chemical reaction. It is a fundamental concept in chemistry and is expressed in joules per mole or kilojoules per mole. The term was first introduced by the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius in 1889. The concept of activation energy is related to the reaction rate, which is the speed at which a chemical reaction occurs. The higher the activation energy, the slower the chemical reaction, as more energy is required to overcome the energy barrier for the reaction to proceed. In contrast, if the activation energy is low, the reaction rate is high as the reaction can easily take place. In a chemical reaction, the reactants first have to be converted into an activated complex or transition state, which is a short-lived, high-energy, unstable state. The formation of this structure requires an input of energy which is the activation energy. This explains why you need to, for instance, heat a mixture to kick start a reaction: you are feeding in the activation energy. In many cases, a catalyst is used to decrease the activation energy of a reaction. By providing a different reaction pathway, catalysts reduce the energy required to reach the transition state, and hence increase the rate of the reaction. Catalysts are extensively used in the chemical industry and biochemistry. In our bodies, for instance, enzymes act as catalysts to allow biochemical reactions to proceed quickly at normal body temperature. While \\"decomposition energy\\", \\"reaction energy\\", and \\"positive energy\\" can be associated with chemical reactions in certain contexts, none of them refers specifically to the amount of energy required to start a reaction. Decomposition energy refers to the energy associated with the breakdown of a compound into its constituent elements. Reaction energy generally refers to the energy change in a chemical reaction, which can be exothermic (releases energy) or endothermic (absorbs energy). \\"Positive energy\\" is not a term commonly used in the field of chemistry. So, the answer again: the amount of energy required to begin a chemical reaction is known as Activation Energy."},{"instruction":"Trying to snap a three-game skid, the Falcons went home and played a Week 9 interconference duel with the San Francisco 49ers.

The two key figures mentioned here are the then-incumbent Prime Minister, John Howard of the Liberal Party, and the main opposition leader, Mark Latham of the Australian Labor Party. The central theme and focal point of the 2004 Australian federal election campaign was the issue of \\"trust.\\" In the run-up to the election, both John Howard and Mark Latham emphasized the importance of trust in their campaigns. They sought to convince Australian voters that their respective parties had the qualities necessary to guide the nation through a time of significant global and domestic challenges. John Howard, who was seeking his fourth term as prime minister, was keen on highlighting his experience and competence as a leader. Since first being elected in 1996, Howard successfully navigated Australia through a period of strong economic growth and low unemployment. Additionally, he played a significant role in strengthening Australia's alliances with important global partners, especially the United States, particularly as a strong supporter of U.S.-led initiatives in Afghanistan and Iraq. Throughout the campaign, Howard sought to portray himself as a trustworthy, experienced, and stable leader, well-versed in the complexities of foreign and domestic policies. Furthermore, he pointed to the achievements and consistency of his government as evidence of his party's ability to lead the nation effectively and ensure its national security and continued prosperity. On the other hand, Mark Latham, who had taken over as the leader of the Australian Labor Party in December 2003, was eager to present a fresh and viable alternative to Howard's government. Latham focused on a range of pressing issues, such as climate change, improving the public healthcare system, and investing in education and infrastructure. One of his key campaign promises was to withdraw Australian troops from Iraq. As the main opposition leader, Latham positioned himself as a passionate and energetic advocate for change, with a vision for a more inclusive, compassionate, and forward-looking Australia. He argued that the Howard government had become complacent and disconnected from the concerns of ordinary citizens, and sought to capitalize on voter fatigue with the incumbent. Latham centered his campaign on the notion that the Australian people could place their trust in him and his party to bring about meaningful, positive reforms in the national interest. In conclusion, the 2004 Australian federal elections were marked by an emphasis on the notion of trust as a key issue. Both the incumbent Prime Minister, John Howard, and the main opposition leader, Mark Latham, sought to highlight their respective qualities and visions as the basis for voters to place their trust in them. Ultimately, the election resulted in a victory for John Howard and the Liberal Party, securing another term in office and validating their claims of trustworthiness and competence in the eyes of the Australian electorate."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Read my Lips Movie plot: The film is set partially in the business offices and partially in the underworld of Paris. Carla, a lonely woman burdened by lack of respect from her co-workers and her only friend, Annie, begins to change after a younger man enters her life. Carla is introduced immediately with a shot of her putting in her hearing aids. She is an overworked and under-appreciated secretary for a construction company, ridiculed behind her back by her co-workers who do not know she is deaf but despise her homely appearance and subservient position. After she faints from exhaustion she accepts the boss's offer to hire an intern to lighten her load. The first applicant to be her assistant, Paul, is an ex-convict who is not technically qualified to be Carla's assistant, but she hires him. Paul's affable nature and \\"bad boy\\" spirit relieve Carla's loneliness and open up new possibilities for her. She rebuffs his initial clumsy sexual advances, but gradually they become a team, using creative but questionable methods to improve Carla's position at work. Paul convinces her to help himÂ â by using her lip-reading skillsÂ â to rob Marchand, a nightclub owner to whom he owes a lot of money and for whom he is working at night to pay off the debt. Reluctant at first, Carla becomes more intrigued as problems arise. After Paul fails to find the money, Carla finds it in Marchand's freezer and takes it to the car where she waits for Paul. Marchand discovers the theft, thinks Paul stole the money, catches and beats him. Carla ingeniously engineers his escape and the robbery's total success single-handedly and with obvious relish. As the movie ends, she instigates their making out for the first time in the car. My question: What medical condition causes Carla to faint? The answer is:","output":"Carla's fainting could be attributed to several medical conditions or factors, but the most likely cause in this scenario appears to be exhaustion, possibly combined with stress from being overworked and under-appreciated at her job. Fainting, or syncope, occurs when there is a temporary decrease in blood flow to the brain, which can be induced by factors such as fatigue, dehydration, low blood sugar, emotional distress, or other underlying medical conditions. In Carla's case, her demanding work environment, lack of support, and the immense pressure she experiences likely contribute to her physical and mental exhaustion, leading her to faint."},{"instruction":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Mint 400 for the following movie plot: A montage of news clips of Civil Rights Movement and Vietnam War protests is seen while The Lennon Sisters cover of \\"My Favorite Things\\" is heard.

The group of eight Republicans — some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races — defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year.

In most cases, though, the phrase \\"with big heart\\" can be confidently seen as a positive one."},{"instruction":"Information: - Modern rock is an umbrella term describing rock made from the 1980s to present day. Some radio stations use the term to distinguish themselves from classic rock, which tend more towards 1960s-1980s rock music. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - \`\` Through the Iris '' is a single released by alternative rock / metal band 10 Years in 2006 . It is the second single released and track 8 from their first major release , The Autumn Effect . It was released for radio only , as there was no CD single . Like the previous single , the song was also originally released on Killing All That Holds You , the band 's second independent album , produced by Travis Wyrick . The album was eventually reissued with four acoustic tracks . The acoustic tracks were recorded live by Mike D. for Lakeside Studios . It was track 2 and clocked in at 3:23 . - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - The Autumn Effect is the third studio album by the Tennessee rock band 10 Years. Produced by Josh Abraham, released on August 16, 2005 through Universal Records and Republic Records. Featured on the album is the popular modern rock track \\"Wasteland\\" and two other singles, \\"Through the Iris\\" and \\"Waking Up\\". - Josh Abraham is an American record producer, songwriter, and music executive. Having worked with some of the music industry's most successful artists over the past 15 years including P!nk, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Kelly Clarkson, Shakira, Weezer, Linkin Park, Velvet Revolver, Carly Rae Jepsen, Adam Lambert, and Slayer, he has produced and co-written songs accounting for sales of more than 40 million albums worldwide. - Independent music (often shortened to indie music or indie) is music produced independently from major commercial record labels or their subsidiaries, a process that may include an autonomous, do-it-yourself approach to recording and publishing. The term \\"indie\\" is sometimes also used to describe a genre (such as indie rock and indie pop); as a genre term, \\"indie\\" may include music that is not independently produced, and most independent music artists do not fall into a single, defined musical style or genre, and usually create music that can be categorized into other genres. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Republic Records is an American record company that operates as a division of Universal Music Group. The label was endowed by Monte Lipman and Avery Lipman in 1995; it was later paired into the Universal Motown Republic Group in 1999. After the separation of Motown Records from Universal Motown Records, the Universal Motown Republic Group was shuttered, the label was temporarily reincarnated as Universal Republic Records in 2006, until it was revived in late 2012. The label's main offices are located in New York City, New York, United States, other offices of the record label are located at the Interscope Center in Santa Monica, California, U.S. - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.

They gather data on everything from the moisture of our soil to the intensity of mighty hurricanes. Day after day they orbit the planet, watching, recording and transmitting. These spacecraft lead a lonely, desolate life, with one major perk: the gorgeous view. NASA, a composer and an architect are trying to bring the Earth-orbiting satellite's experience down to the planet's surface with an art installation in New York City this weekend as part of the World Science Festival. The shell-shaped piece of art they created — made out of aluminum and called the NASA Orbit Pavilion — is designed to be acoustically ideal for groups of kids and adults standing in the middle of it for a five-minute sound show. The show is engineered to take listeners on a journey with the 20 NASA satellites studying Earth today. These kinds of art and education pieces provide an important source of inspiration for people who may not know much about NASA otherwise, Ellen Stofan, NASA's chief scientist, said. \\"Apollo inspired a whole generation of kids to go into engineering, math, science,\\" Stofan told Mashable in an interview at the exhibit. \\"They didn't end up all working for NASA, but I think NASA plays a really important inspirational role in getting kids to go into STEM subjects.\\" The exhibit starts with a rocket launch (as any proper space mission does). The dome of the shell shakes, and you can feel the reverberation of the sound in your bones, just like a real launch. The sound design then moves into a composition written by composer Shane Myrbeck that uses different kinds of sounds to represent the 20 satellites and the International Space Station as they orbit the planet. NASA's Orbit Pavilion from the outside. Image: Greg Kessler/World Science Festival Myrbeck used instruments like the piano and cello for land-studying satellites, while he used a blend of sounds from wind and glass instruments for atmosphere-observing probes, and water-derived noises for ocean-observing satellites The Space Station, which is an international project, is represented by vocal harmony. The vocals change throughout the composition because the people on the station change, Myrbeck said. \\"It sounds like an echo of a memory,\\" StudioKCA architect Jason Klimoski told Mashable. He designed the overall installation. \\"It's very lonely. The sounds are getting more and more space-like because they're more and more lonely. You think about these things way out in space listening — always listening — listening to the Earth, listening to the land.\\" After the musical interpretation of the satellites, the soundscape pivots again. People in the dome can then hear a voice call out the various names of NASA satellites — SMAP, Aqua, etc. — as they fly overhead and in every direction. Myrbeck, NASA's David Delgado and Dan Goods gather real-time data to sonically demonstrate where the satellites are in space at any given moment. The installation comes at a time when NASA's Earth science objectives have come under fire from members of Congress. Some congressional officials have said that NASA should focus on human and robotic exploration goals instead of Earth research because other government agencies, like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are tasked with learning more about our home planet. But Stofan thinks that NASA is in a particularly unique position to observe Earth on a planet-wide scale, allowing them to focus on complex processes like global climate. \\"The Earth is a planet, and only NASA has the unique ability to study planets. The Earth needs to be studied as a planet because it's a very complex system. Other agencies focus on doing research here on the planet. NASA focuses on using the techniques, the tools and pushing the technology for studying our planet from space.\\" Perhaps NASA should erect the installation in Congress as an experiential lobbying project, because it certainly drives home the fact that the agency has a lot of assets in space that beam back data about Earth everyday. The exhibit is open in New York through Sunday, and might \\"resurface\\" again locally sometime this summer, according to the World Science Festival. Summary:","output":"NASA, a composer, and an architect have collaborated to bring the Earth-orbiting satellite's experience down to the planet's surface with an art installation in New York City as part of the World Science Festival. The NASA Orbit Pavilion, constructed with aluminum and designed to be acoustically perfect, played a 5-minute sound show in which 20 of NASA's Earth-observing satellites were represented through music. This art installation aims to inspire people, especially children, to become more interested in STEM subjects, as well as showcasing NASA's unique ability to study the Earth as a planet due to its wide range of orbiting satellites."},{"instruction":"Question: The answer to the question: What was the title of R.E.M.'s fourth album? is inside the article: The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), demonstrated a change in direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, who had worked with Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions worked its way into the context for the album's themes. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by \\"the whole idea of the old men sitting around the fire, passing on ... legends and fables to the grandchildren\\".They toured Canada in July and August 1985, and Europe in October of that year, including The Netherlands, England (including one concert at London's Hammersmith Palais), Ireland, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Belgium and West Germany. On October 2, 1985, the group played a concert in Bochum, West Germany, for the German TV show Rockpalast. Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time. Fables of the Reconstruction performed poorly in Europe and its critical reception was mixed, with some critics regarding it as dreary and poorly recorded. As with the previous records, the singles from Fables of the Reconstruction were mostly ignored by mainstream radio. Meanwhile, I.R.S. was becoming frustrated with the band's reluctance to achieve mainstream success.For its fourth album, R.E.M. enlisted John Mellencamp's producer Don Gehman. The result, Lifes Rich Pageant (1986), featured Stipe's vocals closer to the forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Peter Buck related, \\"Michael is getting better at what he's doing, and he's getting more confident at it. And I think that shows up in the projection of his voice.\\" The album improved markedly upon the sales of Fables of the Reconstruction and reached number..., can you guess it ?

If we break it down, we can analyze the components of the premise and the hypothesis to better understand this connection. Premise: \\"What I'd like to know is how them bushwhackers knew jus' where to lay down an' wait for Oliveri.\\" Hypothesis: \\"It surprises me they were able to take down Oliveri.\\" In the premise, the speaker is wondering how the bushwhackers were able to determine the precise location where they could lay an ambush for Oliveri. This implies that the bushwhackers had some knowledge or information about Oliveri's whereabouts, which they used strategically to carry out their plan. The premise suggests that the bushwhackers were successful at least in setting up an ambush, but it doesn't explicitly state whether they managed to take down Oliveri or not. The hypothesis involves the speaker's reaction to the bushwhackers' ability to take down Oliveri. It shows that the speaker is surprised by the outcome of the event. This could be because of multiple reasons, such as the speaker underestimating the bushwhackers' abilities, overestimating Oliveri's strength or protection, or simply not understanding how the bushwhackers managed to plan and execute their attack so well. Considering the premise and hypothesis, if we assume that the bushwhackers were able to lay the perfect ambush, which is directly implied in the premise, then it becomes more plausible that they could have successfully taken down Oliveri. The perfect ambush would give them a tactical advantage, allowing them to take their target by surprise and potentially leaving Oliveri with little chance to defend himself or escape the situation. However, it is important to note that the connection between the premise and the hypothesis is not a definitive one. While a well-executed ambush increases the likelihood of successfully taking down Oliveri, it does not guarantee it. There might be other factors, such as Oliveri's ability to defend himself, help from others, or even sheer luck, that could have helped Oliveri to survive the situation. So, even if the premise is true, it doesn't undeniably confirm the hypothesis. In conclusion, if the premise is true and the bushwhackers were indeed able to lay a perfect ambush for Oliveri, then it seems more likely that the hypothesis is true as well. While there is a connection between the two statements, it is not an absolute one. Instead, it merely increases the probability that if one statement is true, the other might be true as well."},{"instruction":"This article: After fleeing from her abusive stepfather, Nola travels to New York City searching for her biological father.

Paean is not one of the central characters in the Iliad, but he is occasionally mentioned in connection with his divine healing abilities. As the physician of the Gods, Paean is responsible for providing them with medical aid when needed, such as during the midst of battles or other conflicts. In the epic poem, he is particularly noted for his role in tending to the wounds of both gods and mortals alike. It is important to note that Paean's role as the divine healer does not mean he possessed a separate cult dedicated to his worship. The cults in ancient Greece were primarily focused on gods who had more significant roles in mythology, such as Zeus, Hera, or Athena. However, Paean was still considered a highly important figure due to his ability to heal and provide relief to those in need. Paean was traditionally portrayed as a young and beautiful god, which symbolized his close association with youthfulness, vitality, and, ultimately, good health. Additionally, his divine prowess was often said to be personified through the magic-song or hymns sung by ancient Greek magicians and healers, which were believed to have the power to cure disease. These songs, typically performed during rituals, were passed down through generations and paid homage to Paean's expertise in the art of healing. In summary, Paean is the physician of the Gods in the Iliad, responsible for providing medical aid to divine and mortal beings in the epic. Though he did not have a separate cult dedicated to his worship, Paean's importance in ancient Greek society translates through the magic-song sung by magicians, which were believed to contain holy and restorative powers."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Sewage workers Gordie Boggs (David Arquette) and Sean Dawkins (Scott Caan) are huge wrestling fans.

Known for their nutritional value and versatility, beans are an excellent source of protein, fiber, and other essential minerals. From salads and stews to casseroles and dips, beans can be incorporated into countless dishes. However, the key to turning beans into a rich and tantalizing meal lies in how you cook and flavor them. In this article, we'll explore some simple, yet effective ways to add flavor to your beans, and create diverse bean dishes you'll keep coming back to. Step 1: Boil the beans with flavorful additions To truly elevate the taste of your beans, it is essential to add some extra flavors to the pot during the boiling phase. Consider adding ingredients like garlic cloves, onion quarters, bay leaves, or even a few dashes of your favorite spices such as cumin or paprika. These aromatic ingredients infuse the beans with flavor as they cook, resulting in a richer, more nuanced dish. Step 2: Incorporate additional vegetables Adding vegetables to your bean dish not only enhances the flavor but also boosts the nutritional value of the meal. Vegetables like bell peppers, carrots, celery, tomatoes, and zucchini perfectly complement beans in dishes like chili, bean salads, and casseroles, creating a well-balanced and satisfying meal. Be sure to saute or roast the vegetables before adding them to the pot to release their natural flavors and maximize their contribution to the dish. Step 3: Substitute stock for bean liquid While traditional bean recipes often call for water or the bean cooking liquid, using chicken, vegetable, or beef stock can significantly enhance the overall flavor of the dish. The stock provides a rich, savory base for your beans, and infuses them with depth and complexity. Consider using homemade stock or a quality store-bought alternative to fully capitalize on this flavor booster. Step 4: Experiment with international variations One of the unique qualities of beans is their adaptability to a wide range of cuisines and flavor profiles. For instance, try giving your refried beans an Italian twist by using white beans like cannellini or Great Northern beans. Mash the beans and mix them with garlic, olive oil, and finely chopped fresh sage for a delicious and unique side dish or spread. Step 5: Utilize a slow cooker A slow cooker is an exceptional appliance for creating flavorful bean dishes. Not only does it tenderize the beans and meld the flavors over an extended period, but it also allows for a hands-off approach to cooking. Simply add ingredients to the slow cooker, turn it on, and let it do its magic while you go about your day. When dinner time rolls around, you'll have a delectable bean dish ready to serve. Conclusion Transforming beans from a bland, monotonous ingredient to a scrumptious, mouthwatering dish is all about introducing flavors and techniques that enhance and complement the beans. By following these simple tips and experimenting with different flavor profiles and cooking methods, you can create bean dishes that are anything but boring. So, go ahead and start enriching your meals with flavorful, versatile bean creations that you and your family will undoubtedly love."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: Given the sentence \\"Man with gray shirt with a white name badge.\\" can we conclude that \\"The man is a complete hermit.\\"?

Cleaning: Rags can be used to clean a wide range of surfaces, from countertops, kitchen appliances, and bathroom fixtures to windows, mirrors, and floors. To maximize their cleaning potential, use them in combination with a suitable cleaning solution based on the surface. 2. Dusting: Rags can effectively remove dust from surfaces like furniture, blinds, and electronics. Spray some water or dusting spray onto the rag to help trap the dust particles, then wipe the surface clean. Remember to shake out the rag frequently to avoid spreading dust around. 3. Polishing: Rags can be used to polish wood, metals, or other surfaces that require a smooth, shiny finish. Apply a polishing compound, wax or oil onto the rag and gently buff the surface in circular motions to achieve the desired result. 4. Drying: Rags can be helpful in quickly drying surfaces like dishes, spillages, or even your hands. Make sure to use a clean, absorbent rag for the best results. 5. Straining: You can use a clean rag as a makeshift strainer for liquids, particularly when you need to remove solids or separate ingredients. Place the rag over a bowl or container, pour the liquid through it, and allow the solid particles to be collected. 6. Painting: Rags can be used for various painting tasks, such as wiping excess paint off brushes, creating texture on walls, or applying a glaze to a surface. 7. Car care: Rags are useful for cleaning the interior and exterior of vehicles. Use them with water, soap, and other automotive cleaning products to wash, dry, and polish cars, motorcycles, and bicycles. 8. Gardening: Use rags for tasks like wiping garden tools, cleaning muddy boots, and even wrapping delicate plant stems for protection during transportation. 9. Pet care: Rags can be used as pet-drying towels, cleaning paws, or wiping dirty pet beds. 10. Craft projects: Rags can be repurposed for various craft projects such as making rag rugs, quilts, or even stuffed toys. To make the most of your rags, remember to: - Store them in a designated location: Keep rags in a specific location, such as a bin or bag, so that they are easily accessible when needed. - Launder them regularly: Wash used rags frequently to maintain their cleaning capabilities and prevent the accumulation of smells or bacteria. Use hot water and detergent for the best results. Dry them well to avoid unpleasant odors. - Separate rags by purpose: Try to separate rags based on their intended use (e.g., kitchen rags, workshop rags, etc.), to avoid cross-contamination and ensure they are most effective for the task at hand. - Replace them periodically: Over time, rags may become less effective due to wear and tear. Replace them when necessary to maintain optimum performance."},{"instruction":"U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 493*b - 976*b - 333913 = -221*b + 4441*b for b, we first need to simplify the equation by combining like terms (terms with the same variable). 1. Combine like terms on the left side: 493*b - 976*b = (-483)*b So the equation becomes: -483*b - 333913 = -221*b + 4441*b 2. Combine like terms on the right side: -221*b + 4441*b = 4220*b Now, the simplified equation is: -483*b - 333913 = 4220*b 3. To get all the terms with variable 'b' on one side of the equation, we can add 483*b to both sides: -333913 = 4220*b + 483*b 4. Combine the 'b' terms on the right side: 4220*b + 483*b = 4703*b Now, we have: -333913 = 4703*b 5. To solve for 'b', we need to isolate the variable by dividing both sides of the equation by 4703: b = -333913 / 4703 6. Calculate the value for 'b': b ≈ -71 So, the solution to the equation 493*b - 976*b - 333913 = -221*b + 4441*b for b is b ≈ -71."},{"instruction":"Bailey used trickery to control his classmates think he can solve the mat problem.

Although the term may encompass entities such as courts and prisons, it is most frequently applied to those who directly engage in patrols or surveillance to dissuade and discover criminal activity, and those who investigate crimes and apprehend offenders, a task typically carried out by the police or another law enforcement agency. Furthermore, although law enforcement may be most concerned with the prevention and punishment of crimes, organizations exist to discourage a wide variety of non-criminal violations of rules and norms, effected through the imposition of less severe consequences. - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - , also known as Karate Bullfighter, is a Japanese martial arts film made by the Toei Company in 1975. It was the first in a trilogy of films based on the manga \\"Karate Baka Ichidai\\" (literal translation: A Karate-Crazy Life), a manga based on Masutatsu Oyama's life by Ikki Kajiwara, Jiro Tsunoda and Jya Kagemaru. Sonny Chiba stars as his former master Oyama who was the founder of Kyokushin karate. Chiba would reprise this role in two more films \\"Karate Bearfighter\\" (1975), and \\"Karate for Life\\" (1977). - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - Early life. Miura was born on October 3, 1949, in Kisarazu, Chiba, Japan, the son of a ship's engineer. He has one younger brother and one younger sister.

Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1939, and became a US citizen in 1955. - Film producers fill a variety of roles depending upon the type of producer. Either employed by a production company or independent, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting script, coordinating writing, directing and editing, and arranging financing. During the \\"discovery stage\\", the producer has to find and acknowledge promising material. Then, unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate screenwriter. - Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) is promoted by UNESCO as a counterpart to the World Heritage focusing mainly on intangible aspects of culture. In 2001, UNESCO made a survey among States and NGOs to try to agree on a definition, and the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage was drafted in 2003 for its protection and promotion. - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government.

Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - A cameo role or cameo appearance (often shortened to just cameo) is a brief appearance or voice part of a known person in a work of the performing arts, typically unnamed or appearing as themselves.

Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - History. Founding of International Karate Organization / Kyokushinkaikan. After formally establishing the Kyokushinkaikan in 1964, Oyama directed the organization through a period of expansion. Oyama hand-picked instructors who displayed ability in marketing the style and gaining new members. Oyama would choose an instructor to open a new dojo. The instructor would move to that town and demonstrate his karate skills in public places. After that, word of mouth would spread through the local area until the dojo had a dedicated core of students. Oyama also sent instructors to other countries such as the Netherlands (Kenji Kurosaki), Australia (Shigeo Kato) and (Mamoru Kaneko), the United States of America (Tadashi Nakamura, Shigeru Oyama and Yasuhiko Oyama, Miyuki Miura), Great Britain (Steve Arneil), Canada (Tatsuji Nakamura) and Brazil (Seiji Isobe) to spread Kyokushin in the same way. Many students, including Jon Bluming, Steve Arneil, and Howard Collins, traveled to Japan to train with Oyama directly. In 1969, Oyama staged \\"The First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships\\" and Terutomo Yamazaki became the first champion. All-Japan Championships have been held at every year. In 1975, \\"The First World Full Contact Karate Open Championships\\" were held in Tokyo.

Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Martial arts film is a film genre. A subgenre of the action film, martial arts films contain numerous martial arts fights between characters. They are usually the films' primary appeal and entertainment value, and often are a method of storytelling and character expression and development. Martial arts are frequently featured in training scenes and other sequences in addition to fights. Martial arts films commonly include other types of action, such as hand-to-hand combats, stuntwork, chases, and gunfights. - Performing arts are a form of art in which artists use their voices and/or their bodies, often in relation to other objects, to convey artistic expression.

However, I can provide general information on mobile tracking for legitimate purposes, such as finding a lost or stolen phone or using location-sharing with consent from the device owner. 1. To track a phone with permission or for personal use: Step 1: Turn on the device's location services To track a mobile phone, its location services, such as GPS, must be enabled. This usually requires the device owner's consent. Step 2: Use a built-in feature or app Some phones have built-in tracking features, such as Find My iPhone for Apple devices and Find My Device for Android users. Alternatively, third-party apps like Life360 or Cerberus offer location-sharing features for consenting users. Step 3: Register and sign in to the service To track the phone using these services, the owner needs to sign in with their Apple ID or Google Account. After signing in, they can view the phone's location on a map through the app or website. 2. To track a mobile phone even when it is off: It is challenging to track a phone when it's off since the phone's signal and internet connection are inactive. However, if the owner enabled location history on their device, you can see its last known location before the phone was turned off. Regarding your query about the similarity of the questions, I would say they are related in the sense that both inquire about tracking a mobile phone but differ in the specific scenarios (i.e., tracking a functioning phone vs. one that is turned off)."},{"instruction":"This article: As wildfire is a natural part of most ecosystems, plants that are indigenous to Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole Pines—the most common tree species in the park—generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by lightning, while another six to ten are started by people—in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive exhibits and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September—the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"To analyze how less waste passed to the bladder might affect MORE waste being removed from the body, let's look at each step of the kidney process and identify if any of the given perturbations could be responsible for this outcome. 1. The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery There is no direct or indirect impact on this step that would result in less waste being passed to the bladder while increasing waste removal from the body. 2. They process it with millions of tiny nephrons A perturbation indirectly impacting this step could increase the efficiency of the nephrons in filtering waste. As a result, less waste would be attached to water and eventually passed to the bladder, while more waste would be removed overall. This could be due to an increased filtration rate of the nephrons or a hormonal response that increases waste removal. 3. Remove all the waste A perturbation directly impacting this step could involve more efficient waste removal, once again contributing to less waste being attached to water and passed to the bladder, and more waste being removed from the body overall. This could also be due to an increased filtration rate of the nephrons or hormonal response. 4.

Send the urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters A direct perturbation impacting this step could involve less waste being passed to the bladder because the ureters are only transferring a smaller amount of waste-laden urine. However, this would not result in more waste being removed from the body, so it doesn't fit the scenario. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation for less waste being passed to the bladder while causing MORE waste to be removed from the body is likely an indirect impact on step 2 (nephron filtration) or a direct impact on step 3 (waste removal). These perturbations could involve factors like increased filtration rate, improved nephron function, or hormonal responses that boost waste removal efficiency."},{"instruction":"If i didn't think of working out as a hobby, can we conclude that \\"Working out is my hobby. \\"?

Disadvantages: - Can be time-consuming as it requires physically pounding the steak. - Might be difficult for some people due to the physical effort involved. - Over-tenderizing can lead to a mushy texture. 2. Marinating the Steak: Advantages: - Enhances the overall flavor of the steak. - Less manual labor involved when compared to using a meat tenderizer. - Acidic ingredients in marinades (such as vinegar, wine, or lemon juice) can help break down the proteins and tenderize the meat. Disadvantages: - Requires a longer time for marinating (usually 1-24 hours). - If left for too long, acidic marinades can make the meat mushy. - Excessive ingredients in a marinade may overpower the steak's natural taste. 3. Using a Meat Tenderizing Powder: Advantages: - Quick and convenient method of tenderizing. - Contains enzymes that specifically target proteins in the meat. - Works well for people who do not want to invest time and effort in manual tenderizing. Disadvantages: - Might impart a slightly different flavor to the steak. - Can be difficult to get an even distribution of the powder. - Overusage may result in a mushy steak. 4. Dry Brining: Advantages: - Enhances the natural flavors of the steak. - Requires minimal effort as compared to manual tenderizing. - Salt helps to tenderize the meat, as it initially draws out the moisture and then allows it to reabsorb, leading to a more tender and juicier steak. Disadvantages: - Longer wait time is required (anywhere from 1 hour to overnight). - Not ideal for those who need to limit salt intake due to dietary restrictions. - Excessive salt application may lead to a too-salty steak. In conclusion, each tenderizing method has its advantages and disadvantages. The best method depends on personal preferences, the available time for cooking, and any dietary restrictions. Manual tenderizing and marinating enhance the flavor and are more natural methods, while meat tenderizing powder and dry brining offer less labor-intensive alternatives. Choose the one that fits your specific needs and enjoy a tender, delicious steak."},{"instruction":"Question: who got nominated in bigg boss season 11??

An organism dies and settles onto the bottom of a body of water or on land, where it gets quickly covered by sediment. This rapid burial helps protect the remains from scavengers, decomposition, and disturbance. To recap, the complete process of fossil formation is: 1. An organism dies and settles onto the bottom of a body of water or on land, where it gets quickly covered by sediment. 2. Sediment builds up over the remains, providing a stable environment for fossilization to occur. 3. The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts of the organism. 4. The remaining parts of the organism are gradually replaced with minerals, which can seep into the porous parts of tissues, turning them into stone-like material. 5. A fossil is formed as the preserved remains or traces of the organism within layers of rock, which can be excavated and studied by paleontologists to learn about the prehistoric past."},{"instruction":"What is the missing first step of the following process: - The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star - The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen - The star becomes a red giant - A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star - The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a nebula - The star leaves behind the core which becomes a dwarf star. Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the given process is: The star starts its life as a protostar, forming from a dense cloud of dust and gas in a nebula. To provide a more detailed explanation, let's go through the entire process with the missing step included: 1. The star begins its life as a protostar, forming from a dense cloud of dust and gas in a nebula. This cloud, mainly composed of hydrogen, starts contracting under its own gravity, becoming hotter and denser over time. As the temperature and pressure rise, nuclear reactions begin at the core of the protostar, marking the beginning of its life as a main-sequence (hydrogen-burning) star. 2. The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star. This means that it is a low- to medium-mass star, typically less than 8 solar masses. Stars in this category do not undergo supernova explosions and instead follow a different evolutionary path leading to the formation of a white dwarf star. 3. The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen. This occurs when the hydrogen in the core is almost fully converted into helium, causing the core to contract and heat up. In turn, helium starts fusing into heavier elements like carbon and oxygen in a process known as helium burning. This phase marks the beginning of the star's ascent along the red giant branch. 4. The star becomes a red giant. As helium burning occurs in the core, the outer layers of the star expand and cool off, giving it a red appearance. This phase is characterized by the star's significant increase in size, which can reach as much as several hundred times its original diameter. 5. A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star. With time, the core becomes richer in carbon and oxygen as the helium fusion continues. For stars with masses lower than about 4 solar masses, the fusion process stops at carbon and oxygen, as the core never becomes hot and dense enough to ignite carbon fusion. 6. The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a planetary nebula. As the red giant's core continues to contract, the outer layers of the star are gradually expelled into space, forming an expanding gas cloud known as a planetary nebula. This occurs due to intense stellar winds caused by the increased radiation pressure from the core. 7. The star leaves behind the core which becomes a white dwarf star. After shedding its outer layers, the exposed hot core is now a white dwarf star, mostly composed of carbon and oxygen. These compact, dense remnants are incredibly hot, but they gradually cool down and emit light over billions of years, eventually fading to black as black dwarfs. However, this cooling process takes such a long time that there are currently no known black dwarfs in the Universe. To summarize, the missing first step in the process is the formation of a star from a protostar in a nebula. This crucial step sets the stage for the entire subsequent stellar evolution."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... Now, I have a new situation: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. Answer this question please: Which would be lighter, item A or item B? A:","output":"Item A, the Earth, has a mean specific gravity of 5.515, while item B, the sample of surface rock, has a typical specific gravity ranging from 2.7 to 3.3. Since specific gravity is an expression of density and is directly related to weight, item A (the Earth) has a higher specific gravity, meaning it is denser and heavier than item B (the sample of surface rock). Therefore, item B would be lighter than item A."},{"instruction":"Here's a question: To where do apple trees drop their fruit?

Lucas' father offers to pay him 2 for each window in the house that he cleans. Each floor of Lucas' house has 3 windows; Lucas lives in a 3-story house. To get Lucas to finish the job faster, his father tells him that he will subtract 1 for every 3 days that pass without Lucas finishing the job. In 6 days, Lucas finishes cleaning all the windows in the house. How much will his father pay him, in dollars?","output":"Step 1: Calculate the total number of windows in the house. Since there are 3 windows per floor and the house has 3 floors, we need to multiply the number of windows per floor by the number of floors. Total windows = 3 windows/floor * 3 floors = 9 windows Step 2: Calculate the amount Lucas earns for cleaning all the windows. Lucas earns 2 for each window he cleans. So we need to multiply the total number of windows by the amount he earns per window. Amount earned = 9 windows * 2/window = 18 Step 3: Calculate the amount of money deducted for the time taken. Lucas takes 6 days to finish the job, so 1 gets subtracted for every 3 days. Days passed = 6 days Deduction time = Days passed / 3 days/deduction Deduction time = 6 days / 3 days/deduction = 2 deductions Amount deducted = 2 deductions * 1/deduction = 2 Step 4: Calculate the total amount Lucas' father pays him.

The river stretches over 6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles) and flows through 11 countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt. The Nile River has two main tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is generally considered the primary source of the Nile River and originates at Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa, located in Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya. The Blue Nile, on the other hand, starts at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan, joining the White Nile at the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. Once the Blue and White Nile tributaries merge, the river continues its course, flowing through Sudan and Egypt, where the Nile makes its way across the Sahara Desert, bringing life-sustaining water and fertile silt deposits to the surrounding regions. For thousands of years, the Nile River has played an integral part in the history, culture, and economy of the ancient Egyptian civilization. The abundant water supply and rich soil allowed the people to develop agriculture and sustain a thriving civilization. After flowing through Egypt, the Nile River enters the final stretch towards its endpoint. As it approaches the northern regions of Egypt, the river flows through the Nile Delta, a vast alluvial fan area that begins in the region of Qanater in Egypt and fans out to the Mediterranean coast. This delta region, characterized by its rich and fertile land, has been the location of numerous ancient settlements and archaeological discoveries. Finally, the Nile River empties into the Mediterranean Sea via several distributaries that branch out from the main river channel in the delta. The Mediterranean Sea is a large, semi-enclosed sea that separates Europe, Africa, and Asia and is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by the Strait of Gibraltar.

This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust. - Bituminous coal or black coal is a relatively soft coal containing a tarlike substance called bitumen. It is of higher quality than lignite coal but of poorer quality than anthracite. Formation is usually the result of high pressure being exerted on lignite. Its coloration can be black or sometimes dark brown; often there are well-defined bands of bright and dull material within the seams. These distinctive sequences, which are classified according to either \\"dull, bright-banded\\" or \\"bright, dull-banded\\", is how bituminous coals are stratigraphically identified. - Durrës, historically also known as Durazzo and Dyrrachium, is the second largest city and a municipality of Albania, and one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities. Geographically, it is central on the coast, about west of the capital Tirana. - Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the deposition and subsequent cementation of that material at the Earth's surface and within bodies of water. Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause mineral and/or organic particles (detritus) to settle in place. The particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment. Before being deposited, the sediment was formed by weathering and erosion from the source area, and then transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice, mass movement or glaciers, which are called agents of denudation. Sedimentation may also occur as minerals precipitate from water solution or shells of aquatic creatures settle out of suspension. - Peat, also called turf, is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter that is unique to natural areas called peatlands, bogs, or mires. The peatland ecosystem is the most efficient carbon sink on the planet because peatland plants capture the CO which is naturally released from the peat, thus maintaining an equilibrium. In natural peatlands, the \\"annual rate of biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition\\", but it takes \\"thousands of years for peatlands to develop the deposits of , which is the average depth of the boreal peatlands\\". One of the most common components is \\"Sphagnum\\" moss (peat moss), although many other plants can contribute. Soils that contain mostly peat are known as histosols. Peat forms in wetland conditions, where flooding obstructs flows of oxygen from the atmosphere, slowing rates of decomposition. - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water. - Fossil fuels are fuels formed by natural processes such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms, containing energy originating in ancient photosynthesis. The age of the organisms and their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and sometimes exceeds 650 million years. Fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include petroleum, coal, and natural gas. Other commonly used derivatives include kerosene and propane. Fossil fuels range from volatile materials with low carbon:hydrogen ratios like methane, to liquids like petroleum, to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon, like anthracite coal. Methane can be found in hydrocarbon fields either alone, associated with oil, or in the form of methane clathrates. - The Ionian Sea (, , ) is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea, south of the Adriatic Sea. It is bounded by southern Italy including Calabria, Sicily, and the Salento peninsula to the west, southern Albania to the north, and the west coast of Greece. - La Guajira is a department of Colombia. It occupies most of the Guajira Peninsula in the northeast region of the country, on the Caribbean Sea and bordering Venezuela, at the northernmost tip of South America. The capital city of the department is Riohacha. - Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means \\"change in form\\". The original rock (protolith) is subjected to heat (temperatures greater than 150 to 200 °C) and pressure (1500 bars), causing profound physical and/or chemical change. The protolith may be a sedimentary rock, an igneous rock or another older metamorphic rock. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Albania (; ), officially the Republic of Albania, is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe. It has a population of 3.03 million as of 2016. Tirana is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Durrës and Vlorë. Albania is located in the south-western part of the Balkan peninsula, bordered by Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, the Republic of Macedonia to the east, and Greece to the south and southeast. The country has a coastline on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea to the west and the Ionian Sea to the southwest where the Albanian Riviera begins. Albania is less than from Italy, across the Strait of Otranto which connects the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea. - The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is an isolated mountain range separated from the Andes chain that runs through Colombia. Reaching an altitude of just from the Caribbean coast, the Sierra Nevada is the world's highest coastal range. The Sierra Nevada encompasses about and serves as the source of 36 rivers. The range is in the Departments of Magdalena, Cesar and La Guajira. - Montenegro (or or ; Montenegrin: \\"Crna Gora\\" / , meaning \\"Black Mountain\\") is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe. It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the south-west and is bordered by Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo to the east, and Albania to the south-east. Its capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as the Old Royal Capital (\\"prijestonica\\"). - Kosovo is a disputed territory and partially recognised state in Southeast Europe that declared independence from Serbia in February 2008 as the Republic of Kosovo. Kosovo is landlocked in the central Balkan Peninsula. Its capital and largest city is Pristina. It is bordered by the Republic of Macedonia and Albania to the south, Montenegro to the west, and the uncontested territory of Serbia to the north and east. While Serbia recognises administration of the territory by Kosovo's elected government, it still continues to claim it as its own Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Anthracite is a hard, compact variety of coal that has a submetallic luster. It has the highest carbon content, the fewest impurities, and the highest calorific content of all types of coal except for graphite. - Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time. - Lignite, often referred to as brown coal, is a soft brown combustible sedimentary rock formed from naturally compressed peat. It is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content. It has a carbon content around 6070 percent. It is mined all around the world and is used almost exclusively as a fuel for steam-electric power generation, but is also mined for its germanium content in China. - Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name \\"nitrogen\\" was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots \\"nitre\\" and - \\"to form\\". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name \\"azote\\", from the Greek \\"no life\\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds. - Vlorë is a coastal city and municipality in southern Albania. It is the second largest port city of Albania, after Durrës. It is where the Albanian Declaration of Independence was proclaimed on November 28, 1912. Vlorë was briefly the capital of Albania. - Albanian Riviera is a coastal area in the County of Vlorë, running along the Ionian Sea under the Ceraunian Mountains in Southern Albania. It should not be confused with the Albanian coastline as a whole, which includes both the Riviera, and the mostly flat coastline of central and north Albania. Traditionally, the region begins south of Llogara National Park, continues down along the coast through the villages of Borsh, Himara, Qeparo, and Piqeras, and ends at Lukovë. The Albanian Riviera was proclaimed as the 2012 Top Value Destination by Frommer's. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Pressure (symbol: \\"p\\" or \\"P\\") is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed. Gauge pressure (also spelled \\"gage\\" pressure) is the pressure relative to the ambient pressure. - Sulfur or sulphur (see spelling and etymology) is a chemical element with symbol S and atomic number 16. It is abundant, multivalent, and nonmetalic. Under normal conditions, sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with chemical formula S. Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow crystalline solid at room temperature. Chemically, sulfur reacts with all elements except for gold, platinum, iridium, tellurium, and the noble gases. - Colombia (or ), officially the Republic of Colombia, is a transcontinental country largely situated in the northwest of South America, with territories in Central America. Colombia shares a border to the northwest with Panama, to the east with Venezuela and Brazil and to the south with Ecuador and Peru. It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is a unitary, constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments. The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples including the Muisca, the Quimbaya and the Tairona. - The Ranchería River is a river located in northern La Guajira Department, Colombia. Born in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta southern steps flows south, abruptly turns northeast and then north towards the Caribbean sea where it finally flows into. - Tirana (regional Gheg Albanian: \\"Tirona\\") is the capital and largest city of Albania and as well the heart of Albania's cultural, economic and governmental activity. It is located on the western center of the country surrounded by hills with the Dajti Mountain on the east and a slight valley opening on the north-west overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance. The city is located some north of Athens, west of Skopje, south-east of Pristina and south of Podgorica. - The Strait of Otranto connects the Adriatic Sea with the Ionian Sea and separates Italy from Albania. Its width at Punta Palascìa, east of Salento is less than . The strait is named after the Italian city of Otranto. - Cerrejón is a field or coal mine, located in the basin of the Ranchería River, southeast of La Guajira Department in Colombia, east of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and west of the Perijá Mountains, in line with the border with Venezuela. It is an open-pit mine, and is one of the largest mines of that type. The coal mine was divided into three main corresponding areas Cerrejón North Zone, Cerrejón Central Zone and Cerrejón South Zone. The mine extends over . - Albania ( previously known as Calabacito from the Spanish meaning Small Calabash tree ) is a town and municipality of the Colombian Department of La Guajira . Is the youngest municipality of this Department along with the town of Uribia and others , created on March 19 , 2000 . Albania neighbors and exclusive enclosed camp site for the Cerrejón coal mine workers and their families , named Mushaisa . - Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed \\"protium\\" (name rarely used, symbol H), has one proton and no neutrons. - Carbon (from \\"coal\\") is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalentmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, C and C being stable, while C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Venezuela, officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, is a federal republic located on the northern coast of South America. It is bordered by Colombia on the west, Brazil on the south, Guyana on the east, and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east. Venezuela's territory covers around with an estimated population . Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity (currently ranks 7th in the world's list of nations with the most number of species), with habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive \\"llanos\\" plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. - Macedonia ( tr. \\"Makedonija\\"), officially the Republic of Macedonia (Macedonian: , tr. \\"Republika Makedonija\\"), is a country in the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. It is one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia, from which it declared independence in 1991. It became a member of the United Nations in 1993, but, as a result of an ongoing dispute with Greece over the use of the name \\"Macedonia\\", was admitted under the provisional description the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (sometimes unofficially abbreviated as FYROM and FYR Macedonia), a term that is also used by international organizations such as the European Union, the Council of Europe and NATO.

Do the plastic bins where people plop their laptops, carry-on bags and shoes look worn and industrial gray or do they look crisp, white and new? At the majority of the more than 400 U.S. airports, the checkpoints are stocked with the generic, government-issued gray bins. They're boring, yes, but they do what the TSA needs them to do: contain your stuff as it sits on the belt that passes through the x-ray machine. But the checkpoints at more than two dozen airports have those crisp, white bins. In those airports the bins do not only what the TSA needs them to do, they also save the TSA time and money. And because there are advertisements inside these bins, they generate income for the airports. Not bad for a bunch of recyclable plastic. The advertisement-bearing bins are the brainchild of Joe Ambrefe, CEO of Security Point Media (SPM), who came up with the idea not long after 9/11 while standing in a long line at an airport security checkpoint. He realized everyone had to grab a bin and that an advertisement inside each bin was a sure-fire way for a company to reach the desirable demographic of business and leisure travelers. 1.

Houston Bush Intercontinental Airport25. Houston Hobby Airport26. Miami International Airport Ambrefe worked up a plan to provide free bins (and carts to move those bins around) in exchange for the right to sell advertisements on the bins. He chose white bins because \\"color is an emotive issue and white is a happier color than industrial gray.\\" He also promised to replace the bins every 90 days with brand new units so that \\"the components are opening-day fresh all the time.\\" Testing began in 2007 and now the Bin Advertising Program is in operation at Orlando, San Diego, Seattle-Tacoma, JFK, LaGuardia and 21 other airports nationwide and is approved by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for all airports. The TSA likes the program because it saves the agency money: The free bins represent an overall savings of between 200,000 and 700,000 on the costs of replacing bins. And TSA spokesperson Greg Soule said the program also \\"reduced injuries associated with lifting bins and improved durability and aesthetics of the checkpoint equipment.\\" Airports like the program because it generates a bit of extra money and helps improve the checkpoint experience for passengers. At Los Angeles International Airport, one of the program's first test sites, spokesperson Nancy Castles says ad revenues helped purchase \\"the long tables, seating, floor mats, wheeled bin carriers, stanchions and other equipment that helps streamline the TSA passenger security screening process.\\" The airport also gets to place its own advertising in some of the bins and is currently promoting its LAX FlyAway bus service. At Nashville International, an early test airport which officially signed up with the program in 2010, spokesperson Emily Richard said, \\"We have experienced significant and consistent improvement of the appearance of the checkpoint since SPM started managing the process.\\" She added that year-to-date income from the program is 7,500. And in Houston, where the Hobby and George Bush Intercontinental airports joined the program in June, Houston Airport System's concessions manager Randy Goodman described the benefits as \\"bright new bins and a streamlined process,\\" and a share of the advertising income that should net the airport about 26,000 for the first six months. Ambrefe hopes to expand the bin advertising program to other airports and continues to tweak the system. He said that while the company has not considered providing separate bins for shoes - a suggestion put forth by some groups concerned about checkpoint health risks - \\"antimicrobial products for use at the checkpoints are in research.\\" In the meantime, both Ambrefe and the TSA might make note of the checkpoint procedures in place at Canada's Prince Rupert Airport, in northern British Columbia. The airport has color-coded bins for boots and shoes and, for the past 18 years, the security team has cleaned all the bins after each of the six daily flights. \\"It's nice to know that when you lay down your suit jacket or coat that the bin has not previously contained any dirty boots or other contaminated item,\\" said airport manager Richard Reed. \\"The bins are cleaned to protect the health of the screening agents and the traveling public,\\" said team leader Virginia Toro. \\"We treat the checkpoint as we do our home: clean is the rule of the day.\\" Harriet Baskas writes about travel etiquette for MSNBC.com and is the author of the airport guidebook Stuck at the Airport and a blog of the same name.

Which country was formerly nicknamed 'The Cockpit of Europe'?","output":"The country formerly nicknamed 'The Cockpit of Europe' is Belgium. This small, yet significant nation is located in northwestern Europe, bordered by the Netherlands to the north, Germany to the east, Luxembourg to the southeast, and France to the south. Covering an area of just over 30,000 square kilometers, Belgium holds a population of approximately 11.5 million people. The nickname 'The Cockpit of Europe' originated mainly due to Belgium's geopolitical position in Europe, which has led to numerous conflicts, invasions, and wars fought in the region throughout history. The strategic location of Belgium – with its flat terrain and fertile lands – made it a crucial battleground in European warfare. Several significant historical events contribute to Belgium's reputation as 'The Cockpit of Europe': 1. Eighty Years' War (1568-1648): Also known as the Dutch War of Independence, this conflict occurred in the Low Countries, comprising modern-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, against the Spanish Habsburgs. The war eventually led to the independence of the Dutch Republic. 2. The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714): This war was sparked by the issue of who would succeed the childless Charles II of Spain. Belgium, being part of the Spanish Netherlands at the time, became a major theater in the conflict. The French, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Dutch Republic all fought to either maintain, expand, or change the balance of power. 3. The Napoleonic Wars (1799-1815): Belgium was invaded by the French, and it remained a part of the French Empire for some time. Battlefields such as Waterloo, located just outside of Brussels, saw one of the most significant battles – The Battle of Waterloo (1815), where Napoleon Bonaparte's forces suffered a decisive defeat against the coalition armies led by the Duke of Wellington and Field Marshal Gebhard von Blücher. 4. World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945): Belgium was in the direct path of German invasions, and the country suffered significant damages during both wars. It was the scene of several battles, such as the Battle of the Yser in World War I and the Battle of the Bulge in World War II. The invasion of neutral Belgium during World War I brought the British Empire into the war. Belgium eventually gained independence from the Netherlands in 1830, following the Belgian Revolution. Even after attaining its own national identity, its strategic location continued to make the nation a critical point of interest for surrounding powers. In conclusion, the nickname ‘Cockpit of Europe’ was a reflection of Belgium’s unfortunate role as the stage for numerous invasions and bloody confrontations throughout European history. Its geographical position at the center of European power struggles and the numerous battles fought on its soil justify the use of this moniker."},{"instruction":"Choose from options.

His mother heard him from in the kitchen and ran over to him. OPT: [+] The mother ignored the child. [+] The mother comforted the child.","output":"The mother, upon hearing her child's painful cry, rushed to the living room with great concern. She saw her young toddler lying on the floor, tears streaming down his red cheeks. Immediately, she assessed the situation and realized that he had fallen from the chair. Her maternal instincts kicked in, and she knew she must comfort her precious child. She kneeled down beside him, scooping him up gently in her loving arms. As she held him, she started to soothingly pat his back, whispering calming words into his tiny ear. \\"It's okay, sweetheart. Mommy's here. You're going to be just fine,\\" she reassured him, trying to ease his pain and fear. As her comforting words and touch started to lessen the toddler's tears, she began to inspect his body for any injuries he might have sustained from the fall. Thankfully, there were no signs of any severe harm, but she knew that he might be feeling sore for a while. She decided that this presented an opportunity to teach her child about safety and responsibility. Holding him close, she took a moment to explain why it was important to be careful while climbing on furniture. \\"You know, my love, it's not safe to climb on chairs like that. We can easily hurt ourselves if we're not careful. We must always ask for help when we want to reach something,\\" she said in a gentle tone. The little boy, still snuggling in his mother's caring embrace, seemed to understand the message. His tears had subsided, and he appeared more at ease now. His mother gave him a tender kiss on his forehead and decided it was best to take a break from the kitchen to spend some quality time with her son. Together, they went to his playroom where they spent the next hour engaging in fun and educational activities, tailored to instill a sense of safety and responsibility in the little boy. With each lesson and game, the toddler gradually became more aware of the importance of taking precautions and asking for assistance when necessary. As the day went by, both the mother and her young son grew more in-sync, developing a stronger bond and understanding of one another. The experience of the fall and the lessons learned brought them closer, ensuring that the once seemingly traumatic event had become a teachable moment that positively impacted both their lives. In the end, the young toddler's fall from the chair wasn't just a fleeting moment of pain and distress; it was an opportunity for growth, understanding, and a reminder that sometimes, life's challenging moments can lead to precious lessons and deeper connections with those we love."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Ballin also stated that there are other commercial factors that distinguish the subject fabrics from fabrics available domestically, including: (1) the subject fabrics are specifically produced as pocketing for men's and boys' fine tailored clothing; (2) a variety of imports are readily available in varying quantities, depending upon its needs; and (3) prices of imports are globally competitive.\\" to French?","output":"Cher enfant de cinq ans, je vais maintenant expliquer cela pour que tu puisses comprendre.

The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) operate in conjunction with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The Canadian Armed Forces is the military organization responsible for the Defense of Canada, its interests, and values. It comprises the Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Army, and the Royal Canadian Air Force. Canada has a long history of participating in international military efforts and providing aid during humanitarian crises. NATO, on the other hand, is a military alliance formed in 1949. It consists of 30 member countries from North America and Europe. Its main objective is to provide collective defense, ensuring that if any one of its member countries is attacked, all the other members will consider it an attack on their territory, and respond accordingly. Canada is one of the founding members of NATO and has consistently played a vital role in NATO operations since its inception. Some notable examples of Canadian participation in NATO missions include the following: 1. The Cold War (1949-1991): During this time, Canadian military forces participated in numerous NATO exercises and operations, with a particular focus on ensuring the collective defense of Western Europe. 2. Kosovo War (1999): Canadian Armed Forces provided ground and air assets during NATO's Operation Allied Force, a 78-day bombing campaign against Serbia in support of the Kosovo Liberation Army. 3. Afghanistan (2001-2014): Canada was a significant contributor to NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan, which aimed at assisting the Afghan Government in providing security and stabilizing the country. The Canadian Armed Forces engaged in combat operations, training, and development work. 4. Libya (2011): Canada contributed naval, air, and special operations forces to NATO's Operation Unified Protector, which aimed to enforce a UN-mandated no-fly zone over Libya during its civil war. 5. Iraq (2014-Present): Canada has been an active contributor to the Global Coalition Against Daesh, taking part in NATO's missions to train, advise, and assist Iraqi security forces in their fight against ISIS.

For permanent parasites and other symbionts, the most intriguing question is whether these organisms can return to a free-living lifestyle and, thus, escape an evolutionary “dead end.” This question is directly related to Dollo's law, which stipulates that a complex trait (such as being free living vs. parasitic) cannot re-evolve again in the same form. Here, we present conclusive evidence that house dust mites, a group of medically important free-living organisms, evolved from permanent parasites of warm-blooded vertebrates. A robust, multigene topology (315 taxa, 8942 nt), ancestral character state reconstruction, and a test for irreversible evolution (Dollo's law) demonstrate that house dust mites have abandoned a parasitic lifestyle, secondarily becoming free living, and then speciated in several habitats. Hence, as exemplified by this model system, highly specialized permanent parasites may drastically de-specialize to the extent of becoming free living and, thus escape from dead-end evolution. Our phylogenetic and historical ecological framework explains the limited cross-reactivity between allergens from the house dust mites and “storage” mites and the ability of the dust mites to inhibit host immune responses. It also provides insights into how ancestral features related to parasitism (frequent ancestral shifts to unrelated hosts, tolerance to lower humidity, and pre-existing enzymes targeting skin and keratinous materials) played a major role in reversal to the free-living state. We propose that parasitic ancestors of pyroglyphids shifted to nests of vertebrates. Later the nest-inhabiting pyroglyphids expanded into human dwellings to become a major source of allergens. [Ancestral ecology; Dollo's law; evolutionary “dead end”; house dust mites; permanent parasitism; Pyroglyphidae.] ||||| A scanning electron microscope image of an American house dust mite. Credit: G. Bauchan and R. Ochoa. In evolutionary biology, there is a deeply rooted supposition that you can't go home again: Once an organism has evolved specialized traits, it can't return to the lifestyle of its ancestors. There's even a name for this pervasive idea. Dollo's law states that evolution is unidirectional and irreversible. But this \\"law\\" is not universally accepted and is the topic of heated debate among biologists. Now a research team led by two University of Michigan biologists has used a large-scale genetic study of the lowly house dust mite to uncover an example of reversible evolution that appears to violate Dollo's law. The study shows that tiny free-living house dust mites, which thrive in the mattresses, sofas and carpets of even the cleanest homes, evolved from parasites, which in turn evolved from free-living organisms millions of years ago. \\"All our analyses conclusively demonstrated that house dust mites have abandoned a parasitic lifestyle, secondarily becoming free-living, and then speciated in several habitats, including human habitations,\\" according to Pavel Klimov and Barry OConnor of the U-M Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Their paper, \\"Is permanent parasitism reversible?—Critical evidence from early evolution of house dust mites,\\" is scheduled to be published online March 8 in the journal Systematic Biology. Mites are arachnids related to spiders (both have eight legs) and are among the most diverse animals on Earth. House dust mites, members of the family Pyroglyphidae, are the most common cause of allergic symptoms in humans, affecting up to 1.2 billion people worldwide. Despite their huge impact on human health, the evolutionary relationships between these speck-sized creatures are poorly understood. According to Klimov and OConnor, there are 62 different published hypotheses arguing about whether today's free-living dust mites originated from a free-living ancestor or from a parasite—an organism that lives on or in a host species and damages its host. In their study, Klimov and OConnor evaluated all 62 hypotheses. Their project used large-scale DNA sequencing, the construction of detailed evolutionary trees called phylogenies, and sophisticated statistical analyses to test the hypotheses about the ancestral ecology of house dust mites. On the phylogenetic tree they produced, house dust mites appear within a large lineage of parasitic mites, the Psoroptidia. These mites are full-time parasites of birds and mammals that never leave the bodies of their hosts. The U-M analysis shows that the immediate parasitic ancestors of house dust mites include skin mites, such as the psoroptic mange mites of livestock and the dog and cat ear mite. \\"This result was so surprising that we decided to contact our colleagues to obtain their feedback prior to sending these data for publication,\\" said Klimov, the first author of the paper and an assistant research scientist in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. The result was so surprising largely because it runs counter to the entrenched idea that highly specialized parasites cannot return to the free-living lifestyle of their ancestors. \\"Parasites can quickly evolve highly sophisticated mechanisms for host exploitation and can lose their ability to function away from the host body,\\" Klimov said. \\"They often experience degradation or loss of many genes because their functions are no longer required in a rich environment where hosts provide both living space and nutrients. Many researchers in the field perceive such specialization as evolutionarily irreversible.\\" The U-M findings also have human-health implications, said OConnor, a professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and a curator of insects and arachnids at the U-M Museum of Zoology. \\"Our study is an example of how asking a purely academic question may result in broad practical applications,\\" he said. \\"Knowing phylogenetic relationships of house dust mites may provide insights into allergenic properties of their immune-response-triggering proteins and the evolution of genes encoding allergens.\\" The project started in 2006 with a grant from the National Science Foundation. The first step was to obtain specimens of many free-living and parasitic mites—no simple task given that some mite species are associated with rare mammal or bird species around the world. The research team relied on a network of 64 biologists in 19 countries to obtain specimens. In addition, Klimov and OConnor conducted field trips to North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. On one occasion, it took two years to obtain samples of an important species parasitizing African birds. A total of around 700 mite species were collected for the study. For the genetic analysis, the same five nuclear genes were sequenced in each species. How might the ecological shift from parasite to free-living state have occurred? There is little doubt that early free-living dust mites were nest inhabitants—the nests of birds and mammals are the principal habitat of all modern free-living species in the family Pyroglyphidae. Klimov and OConnor propose that a combination of several characteristics of their parasitic ancestors played an important role in allowing them to abandon permanent parasitism: tolerance of low humidity, development of powerful digestive enzymes that allowed them to feed on skin and keratinous (containing the protein keratin, which is found in human hair and fingernails) materials, and low host specificity with frequent shifts to unrelated hosts. These features, which occur in almost all parasitic mites, were likely important precursors that enabled mite populations to thrive in host nests despite low humidity and scarce, low-quality food resources, according to Klimov and OConnor. For example, powerful enzymes allowed these mites to consume hard-to-digest feather and skin flakes composed of keratin. With the advent of human civilization, nest-inhabiting pyroglyphids could have shifted to human dwellings from the nests of birds and rodents living in or around human homes. Once the mites moved indoors, the potent digestive enzymes and other immune-response-triggering molecules they carry made them a major source of human allergies.

January 29, 1736] - June 8, 1809) was an English-born American political activist, philosopher, political theorist and revolutionary. One of the Founding Fathers of the United States, he authored the two most influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution and inspired the rebels in 1776 to declare independence from Britain. His ideas reflected Enlightenment-era rhetoric of transnational human rights. Saul K. Padover described him as \\"a corsetmaker by trade, a journalist by profession, and a propagandist by inclination\\". Paine accompanied Col. John Laurens to France and is credited with initiating the mission. It landed in France in March 1781 and returned to America in August with 2.5 million livres in silver, as part of a \\"present\\" of 6 million and a loan of 10 million. The meetings with the French king were most likely conducted in the company and under the influence of Benjamin Franklin. Upon returning to the United States with this highly welcomed cargo, Thomas Paine and probably Col. Laurens, \\"positively objected\\" that General Washington should propose that Congress remunerate him for his services, for fear of setting \\"a bad precedent and an improper mode\\". Paine made influential acquaintances in Paris and helped organize the Bank of North America to raise money to supply the army. In 1785, he was given 3,000 by the U.S. Congress in recognition of his service to the nation. Henry Laurens (father of Col. John Laurens) had been the ambassador to the Netherlands, but he was captured by the British on his return trip there. When he was later exchanged for the prisoner Lord Cornwallis (in late 1781), Paine proceeded to the Netherlands to continue the loan negotiations. There remains some question as to the relationship of Henry Laurens and Thomas Paine to Robert Morris as the Superintendent of Finance and his business associate Thomas Willing who became the first president of the Bank of North America (in January 1782). They had accused Morris of profiteering in 1779 and Willing had voted against the Declaration of Independence. Although Morris did much to restore his reputation in 1780 and 1781, the credit for obtaining these critical loans to \\"organize\\" the Bank of North America for approval by Congress in December 1781 should go to Henry or John Laurens and Thomas Paine more than to Robert Morris. Paine bought his only house in 1783 on the corner of Farnsworth Avenue and Church Streets in Bordentown City, New Jersey and he lived in it periodically until his death in 1809. This is the only place in the world where Paine purchased real estate. In 1787, a bridge of Paine's design was built across the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia. At this time his work on single-arch iron bridges led him back to Paris, France. Because Paine had few friends when arriving in France aside from Lafayette and Jefferson, he continued to correspond heavily with Benjamin Franklin, a long time friend and mentor. Franklin provided letters of introduction for Paine to use to gain associates and contacts in France. Later that year, Paine returned to London from Paris. He then released a pamphlet on August 20 called Prospects on the Rubicon: or, an investigation into the Causes and Consequences of the Politics to be Agitated at the Meeting of Parliament. Tensions between England and France were increasing, and this pamphlet urged the British Ministry to reconsider the consequences of war with France. Paine sought to turn the public opinion against the war to create better relations between the countries, avoid the taxes of war upon the citizens, and not engage in a war he believed would ruin both nations. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what was Paines political background?","output":"From the provided article, Thomas Paine's political background can be described as: he was \\"an English-born American political activist, philosopher, political theorist and revolutionary.\\" He was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and authored influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution, which inspired the rebels to declare independence from Britain.

Use of traditional cavalry on the battlefields of 1914 proved to be disastrous, due to accurate, long-range rifle fire, machine-guns and artillery. Von Bredow's attack had succeeded only because of an unusually effective artillery bombardment just before the charge, along with favorable terrain that masked his approach.

Elmo's mother rarely stayed up past 10:00 PM, and it was nearly 11:00. She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away. Elmo said, \\"Yeah. So, beginning Monday there will be two doctors in the office. That should take a little pressure off. If I need to be out for a day or two, Dr. Edwards can fill in for me.\\" \\"Yeah, or if you need to take off a week for a trip to Hawaii with your beautiful new wife.\\" Carsie gave him a sexy smile. \\"That's right.

In the story, Macy Golong peeked into Mallie Mae's room to find her sleeping, as she usually did at this hour. Macy continues with her night, thinking about Elmo and their past experiences in the Media Room. She overhears a conversation between Elmo and Carsie about Elmo's profession and their potential week trip to Hawaii. The transformation of Macy's relationship with Elmo represents a significant change, as they used to spend hours together in the Media Room, and she even felt like he was falling in love with her. However, since Carsie came into the picture, Macy has been replaced, and she feels hurt and resentful. Carsie is now the person enjoying Elmo's company in the Media Room. The conversation that Macy overhears between Elmo and Carsie is about a new doctor joining his office, who will be called \\"Dr. Ernie\\" to match Elmo's own Sesame Street-themed name. They discuss how this will ease the pressure on Elmo's work, which opens the possibility for a week's vacation in Hawaii for Elmo and Carsie, who are now husband and wife. Throughout this excerpt, we see a combination of personal emotions, unspoken desires, and raw jealousy. Macy undoubtedly still holds strong feelings for Elmo and is unable to let go of the past. Nevertheless, life moves forward for both Elmo and Carsie, leaving Macy to question how she could have been so wrong about their relationship."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Graeme McDowell carded a final round of level-par 72 at the Scottish Open to drop down the leaderboard and miss out on securing a place at the Open.","output":"Title: Graeme McDowell Misses Out on a Spot in the Big Golf Game Hello, little friends! Today, we are going to talk about a golfer named Graeme McDowell. He was trying to get into a really big golf game called the Open. Golfers play in many games, and they have to do their best to get into the biggest games. The Scottish Open is one of those games, and Graeme was playing in it. In golf, players want to hit the ball into the hole in as few shots as possible. The less shots they take, the better they do. In the last day of the Scottish Open, Graeme hit the ball the same number of times as the golf course said was good, which is called \\"level-par 72.\\" But sadly, this was not enough for him. Some other players did even better than him, and they went up on the list called the \\"leaderboard.\\" Because Graeme didn't do as well as he wanted to, he didn't move up on the leaderboard, and he missed out on the chance to play in the big game, the Open. But some other players did get to go, and they were really happy. This shows us that, in sports like golf, players always need to practice and try their best. Graeme will probably keep practicing, and maybe he will get to play in the big game next time. In the meantime, he can learn from this experience and remember that it's not always about winning, but about doing your best and having fun while playing the game. It's important for all of us to remember that, whether we play golf or any other sport!"},{"instruction":"In August 2015, Czech GDP growth was 4.4%, making the Czech economy the highest growing in Europe.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". The broad field of animal communication encompasses most of the issues in ethology. Animal communication can be defined as any behavior of one animal that affects the current or future behavior of another animal. The study of animal communication, called zoo semiotics (distinguishable from anthroposemiotics, the study of human communication) has played an important part in the development of ethology, sociobiology, and the study of animal cognition. Animal communication, and indeed the understanding of the animal world in general, is a rapidly growing field, and even in the 21st century so far, a great share of prior understanding related to diverse fields such as personal symbolic name use, animal emotions, animal culture and learning, and even sexual conduct, long thought to be well understood, has been revolutionized.

In other words, it is the smallest meaningful unit of a language. The field of study dedicated to morphemes is called morphology. A morpheme is not identical to a word, and the principal difference between the two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone, whereas a word, by definition, is freestanding. When it stands by itself, it is considered as a root because it has a meaning of its own (e.g. the morpheme \\"cat\\") and when it depends on another morpheme to express an idea, it is an affix because it has a grammatical function (e.g. the \\"s\\" in \\"cats\\" to indicate that it is plural). Every word comprises one or more morphemes. - A syllable is a unit of organization for a sequence of speech sounds. For example, the word \\"water\\" is composed of two syllables: \\"wa\\" and \\"ter\\". A syllable is typically made up of a syllable nucleus (most often a vowel) with optional initial and final margins (typically, consonants). - The Berber Latin alphabet is the version of the Latin alphabet used to write the Berber languages. It was adopted in the 19th century, using varieties of letters. Today, the Latin alphabet is preferred by most Berber writers and linguists in North Africa and abroad for practical reasons. - In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are , pronounced with the lips pronounced with the front of the tongue pronounced with the back of the tongue pronounced in the throat; and , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and and , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals). Contrasting with consonants are vowels. - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). - In phonetics, a vowel is a sound in spoken language, with two competing definitions. In the more common phonetic definition, a vowel is a sound pronounced with an open vocal tract, so that the tongue does not touch the lips, teeth, or roof of the mouth, such as the English \\"ah\\" or \\"oh\\" . There is no build-up of air pressure at any point above the glottis. This contrasts with consonants, such as the English \\"sh\\" , which have a constriction or closure at some point along the vocal tract. In the other, phonological definition, a vowel is defined as syllabic, the sound that forms the peak of a syllable. A phonetically equivalent but non-syllabic sound is a semivowel. - North Africa or Northern Africa is the northernmost region of Africa. The United Nations definition of \\"North Africa\\" includes seven countries and territories; Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. The countries of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya are often collectively referred to as the Maghreb, which is the Arabic word for \\"sunset\\". Egypt lies to the northeast and encompasses part of West Asia, while Sudan is situated on the edge of the Sahel, to the south of Egypt. - In linguistics, a grapheme is the smallest unit of a writing system of any given language. An individual grapheme may or may not carry meaning by itself, and may or may not correspond to a single phoneme of the spoken language. Graphemes include alphabetic letters, typographic ligatures, Chinese characters, numerical digits, punctuation marks, and other individual symbols. - A spoken language is a language produced by articulate sounds, as opposed to a written language. Many languages have no written form and so are only spoken. An oral language or vocal language is a language produced with the vocal tract, as opposed to a sign language, which is produced with the hands and face. The term \\"spoken language\\" is sometimes used to mean only vocal languages, especially by linguists, making all three terms synonyms by excluding sign languages. Others refer to sign language as \\"spoken\\", especially in contrast to written transcriptions of signs. - A phoneme is one of the units of sound (or gesture in the case of sign languages, see chereme) that distinguish one word from another in a particular language. The difference in meaning between the English words \\"kill\\" and \\"kiss\\" is a result of the exchange of the phoneme for the phoneme . Two words that differ in meaning through a contrast of a single phoneme form a minimal pair. - A noun (from Latin \\"nmen\\", literally meaning \\"name\\") is a word that functions as the name of some specific thing or set of things, such as living creatures, objects, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas. Linguistically, a noun is a member of a large, open part of speech whose members can occur as the main word in the subject of a clause, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition. - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - A syllabary is a set of written symbols that represent the syllables or (more frequently) moras which make up words. A symbol in a syllabary, called a syllabogram, typically represents an (optional) consonant sound (simple onset) followed by a vowel sound (nucleus)that is, a CV or V syllablebut other phonographic mappings such as CVC, CV- tone, and C (normally nasals at the end of syllables) are also found in syllabaries. - The Berber language or Amazigh languages (Berber name: , Tamazit, Tamazight, pronounced ) are a family of similar and closely related languages and dialects indigenous to North Africa. - An abjad (pronounced or ) is a type of writing system where each symbol stands for a consonant, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel. The name \\"abjad\\" is based on the old Arabic alphabet's first four letters - a, b, j, d, to replace the common terms \\"consonantary\\", \\"consonantal alphabet\\" or \\"syllabary\\" to refer to the family of scripts called West Semitic. - The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet. - Arabic (' or ' ) is a Central Semitic language that was first spoken in Iron Age northwestern Arabia and is now the \\"lingua franca\\" of the Arab world. Arabic also is a liturgical language of 1.7 billion Muslims. It is one of six official languages of the United Nations. It is named after the Arabs, a term initially used to describe peoples living from Mesopotamia in the east to the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west, and from northwestern Arabia to the Sinai in the south. - Tifinagh ( Berber pronunciation : ( tifina ) ; also written Tifina in the Berber Latin alphabet , in Neo-Tifinagh , and in the Berber Arabic alphabet ) is a series of abjad and alphabetic scripts used to write Berber languages . A modern derivate of the traditional script , known as Neo-Tifinagh , was introduced in the 20th century . A slightly modified version of the traditional script , called Tifinagh Ircam , is used in a number of Moroccan elementary schools in teaching the Berber language to children as well as a number of publications . The word tifinagh is thought to be a Berberized feminine plural cognate of Punic , through the Berber feminine prefix ti - and Latin Punicus ; thus tifinagh could possibly mean \`\` the Phoenician ( letters ) '' or \`\` the Punic letters '' . - A writing system is any conventional method of visually representing verbal communication. While both writing and speech are useful in conveying messages, writing differs in also being a reliable form of information storage and transfer. The processes of encoding and decoding writing systems involve shared understanding between writers and readers of the meaning behind the sets of characters that make up a script. Writing is usually recorded onto a durable medium, such as paper or electronic storage, although non-durable methods may also be used, such as writing on a computer display, in sand, or by skywriting.

She was a member of the European People's Party and the Christian Democratic Appeal Party. During her tenure as an MEP, one of her focuses was on improving pension systems across the European Union. The report on adequate, sustainable, and secure European pension systems aims to address the challenges faced by the pension systems in the European Union's member countries. It proposes a number of measures to ensure that these systems are financially sustainable and provide adequate support to retirees. Some key recommendations of the report include: 1. Encouraging higher employment rates, particularly among older workers, as well as increasing the effective retirement age, in order to support the financial stability of pension systems. This can be achieved through targeted incentives and policies. 2. Ensuring that pension systems are sufficiently funded and that the investments made by pension funds are managed prudently and transparently. 3. Strengthening the link between contributions and benefits, so that those who have contributed more to their pension funds can expect to receive higher benefits upon retirement. 4. Promoting greater harmonization and coordination across different European pension systems, in order to improve pension portability and make it easier for citizens to move and work across the European Union. 5. Encouraging member countries to develop and implement more efficient and effective ways of delivering pension benefits, such as through the digitalization of services and the simplification of administrative processes. 6. Protecting the rights and interests of beneficiaries, ensuring that pension funds are adequately regulated and supervised, and promoting the development of consumer protection measures, including clear and transparent information for pension savers. Overall, the report on adequate, sustainable, and secure European pension systems aims to provide a comprehensive roadmap for the improvement of pension systems across the EU member countries.

Most people turn to certain songs to make them feel better. The main reason behind this is that music can express our feelings better than any other medium. In addition, we have favorite songs for particular situations because we turn to the music which has the best effect on us. Music and exercise Have you ever noticed how out of breath you get when listening to an exciting song while doing exercises at the gym? It has been suggested that exciting music can actually increase muscle tension , while light music does the opposite. It has also been proved that music can improve motor skills. An experiment done on a group of pupils proved that children learning basic motor skills such as throwing ,catching and jumping while listening to music did better than those with no music. Chronic pain relief Music also has the ability to reduce chronic pain. In fact, according to a paper published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, music can reduce chronic pain by 21%. The paper reports that 60 patients in an experiment were divided into two groups--one group listened to music, and the other did not.

Historian Bruce Cumings argues, however, the KPA's rapid withdrawal was strategic, with troops melting into the mountains from where they could launch guerrilla raids on the UN forces spread out on the coasts.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","output":"In the text provided, the hiding place of the guerrillas is not explicitly mentioned, but we can deduce some information based on the historical context and tactics they employed. The passage states that during the Korean War, North Korean forces withdrew rapidly, with some accounts suggesting that they did not effectively utilize the advice on tactics offered by Zhou Enlai. However, historian Bruce Cumings argues that this withdrawal was strategic, and the troops melted into the mountains. From this, we can infer that the hiding place of the guerrillas was likely in the mountains. The guerrilla strategy often relies on utilizing difficult terrain, such as mountains and forests, as a form of natural defense against a more substantial force. By blending into these environments, guerrillas can plan and launch surprise attacks on enemy forces, making it challenging for their opponents to predict their movements or locate their hiding places. The terrain provides both a physical barrier and natural cover for the guerrillas, making it an ideal hiding place for conducting their operations. To summarize, while the exact location of the hiding place is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that the North Korean guerrillas hid in the mountainous regions during the Korean War. This allowed them to strategically carry out surprise raids on the UN forces spread out along the coasts."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: who escaped in the film the great escape?","output":"As an AI language model, I am unable to watch films, but I have knowledge about them. \\"The Great Escape\\" is a 1963 film based on the true story of a escape by Allied prisoners of war from the German POW camp, Stalag Luft III, during World War II. The escape involved several characters, portrayed by a talented ensemble cast. Some of the notable characters who were involved in the escape attempt are: 1. Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (played by Richard Attenborough) - The mastermind behind the escape plan, based on the real-life character Roger Bushell. 2. Captain Virgil Hilts (played by Steve McQueen) - An American Air Force pilot, known as the \\"Cooler King\\" due to his frequent stays in the isolation cell for escape attempts. 3.

Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (played by James Coburn) - An Australian prison camp scrounger who helps acquire materials for the escape, inspired by the real-life character Bram van der Stok. In the film, a total of 76 prisoners successfully escape the camp. However, only three characters (Hendley, Sedgwick, and Danny's partner Willie) manage to reach safety and evade recapture.

As an editor, I do this a lot. But the decision to not run the extremely graphic photos of the Empire State Building shooter’s lifeless body was among the most important I’ve made this year. It’s been a tough year in the newsroom, with a seemingly endless stream of violent shootings in very public places. Until today, the most recent was the Aurora, Colo., “Dark Knight” massacre. During these times, the news team has to make dozens of on-the-fly decisions about how we’ll approach a breaking and still-developing story and what is news and what is simply exploitation. The images that came out of Aurora were disturbing, yet not graphic. The images I saw today shortly after the shootings just outside the Empire State Building were graphic, disturbing and instantly unforgettable. So why didn’t I run them? When I looked at the photo of the man lying on the ground, surrounded by police officers and clearly dead of a gunshot wound to the head, I could barely believe it. It’s not the kind of image I see without warning on TV, on the web, in newspapers. Even after a caution, networks usually don’t show something that graphic (though they sometimes do, I know). It’s actually a series of images, which have since been removed, on a Flickr account. The photographer was in the area and took five or six very clear images of the police moving around and the victim, who was lying very, very still in a pool of blood. Seeing it felt like punch in the gut. It made me queasy, but the image itself did not add anything to our news reporting. We discussed the photos in the newsroom. Should we run them? No one wanted to and I decided against it. Another photo emerged, this time on Instagram, of a victim (he may have been an Empire State Building tour ticket-taker) who was wounded but not obviously dead. This one was somewhat less graphic and, yes, I considered running it. The guy who took the photo was inundated on Twitter with requests from other news organizations to run it. We did not join the chorus, though, when we realized we weren’t 100% sure if the victim was dead or alive and if his family had been notified. At the time, the numbers of wounded and killed were unknown, as was the severity of the injuries. Again, I couldn’t say that this image would have added anything to Mashable’s report on the event, so I passed. Later in the afternoon, when it became clear that the man in the photo was injured but expected to recover, we ran the photo in a related story. Overall, I think I made the right call. Graphic images of dead and wounded people do not make the news any more or less real. The shootings at the Empire State Building happened. Mashable’s job is to tell that story and give it context. Such images doubtlessly trigger strong emotions, but they did not help unravel the conflicting reports of the total number of people shot or make sense of the somewhat contradictory versions of the sequence of events. Other sites, though, clearly felt differently and ran the photos. Some of the readers and those who followed the links to the stories through Twitter were upset. I’m not here to bash those newsrooms, because I know it’s a tough decision. Each editor believes that he or she knows their readers and what they can and can’t stomach and what kind of information they desire. I simply didn’t think the Mashable audience wanted to see those images. I wish I never had. But maybe that’s just me. It is hard to know where to draw the line on graphic photos and video. People say they know pornography when they see it and it’s easy to weed out. Is violence the same way? We see violence in film, but know it’s fake, so perhaps that makes it okay. The violence in, say, the Expendables is far worse than these images, and yet, I don’t have the same reaction because I know no one has died; it’s all make-believe. When I saw that photo of a body on the ground in a pool of blood, I felt very differently than when I saw that movie. I guess, as with pornography, you know the real thing when you see it. So if I’m so certain, why ask the question? Because I have doubts. Three photos immediately come to mind and they are, perhaps, only slightly less graphic that the images I saw today: Martin Luther King lying on the balcony, surrounded by supporters shortly after being shot by James Earl Ray; the Kent State massacre where a young woman is weeping over the face-down body of a shot classmate; and Robert F. Kennedy, captured eyes open, with a pool of blood spreading out below him as he succumbs to a gunshot wound from his assassin, Sirhan Sirhan. Those, too, are all arresting images. I’ve been seeing most of them since I was young. They’re all in black and white, so blood, if there is any, is black. No wounds are visible and the Kennedy photo is almost, to be honest, artistic. Still, I imagine some will point to these examples as they make a case for why I’m just plain wrong. So here begins a conversation. Was I wrong? Should Mashable have run those images? What would you think if you saw such an image on the site? Weigh in in the comments.

In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his \\"Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere\\" (18551862). He also wrote \\"Classification der Säugethiere und Vögel\\" (1844), and, with Heinrich Georg Bronn, \\"Die Gavial-artigen Reste aus dem Lias\\" (18421844). - The Quinarian system was a method of zoological classification which had a brief period of popularity in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup. Swainson's work on ornithology gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of Charles Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" (1859 ) which paved the way for evolutionary trees. - Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin \\"philosophia naturalis\\") was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science.

Translate to English English:","output":"\\"We cannot influence events if we are not considered a central actor in Cambodia's development.\\" In this statement, the subject insists that their effectiveness in contributing to Cambodia's progress relies on their perceived importance and involvement in events taking place within the region. This suggests that in order to make a genuine impact on the development of Cambodia, they must first be regarded as a key player or decision-maker within the context of the nation's growth. Without this recognition, their potential to influence change and direct positive outcomes could be severely limited, ultimately affecting the extent to which Cambodia can continue to evolve and prosper. The reference to being a central actor also implies that the subject believes they possess certain skills, knowledge, or resources that could make a meaningful difference in how Cambodia navigates the challenges and opportunities it faces. This could include expertise in areas such as economics, governance, education, or healthcare, which could all play critical roles in shaping the nation's trajectory. Moreover, the statement highlights the interconnectedness of global affairs, where different countries and entities can and often do influence each other's development. In the context of Cambodia, outside actors like international organizations, neighboring countries, or foreign investors could all represent valuable sources of support and guidance. In turn, their involvement could also bring benefits for themselves, since a stable and prosperous Cambodia would likely promote regional stability, enhanced trade opportunities, and other positive outcomes. However, it is important to ensure that these external actors genuinely work for the long-term benefit of Cambodia and its people, rather than merely advancing their own interests at the expense of the population. This underscores the importance of trust, respect, and mutually beneficial relationships in fostering effective international partnerships. Ultimately, the statement underlines the importance of being recognized as a central actor in driving the development of a nation like Cambodia. This status not only enhances one's ability to shape events and outcomes but also motivates other stakeholders to collaborate and engage in productive dialogue.

Article: Most people are aware of what the adoption process is because it has become rather common in our society. Adoption is where a child is legally placed with guardians or parents (or perhaps a single parent) other than the birth mother or father. Once an adoption is finalized, all parental rights are turned over to the adoptive parents and there is no legal difference between adoptive parents and natural birth parents. There are generally two types of adoption, which are closed adoption and open adoption. When an adopted person has access to his or her adoption file and original records, it is referred to as an open adoption. The term is also used to describe any contact that may be between the adoptive family, the birth parents, and the adopted child. The level of openness can change greatly in such contact depending on each individual relationship. There can be indirect contact between the natural birth parents and the child through the form of letters and photographs, or there can be actual physical contact. A semi-open adoption is where the birth parents may have contact with the adoptive parents before the birth of the child, either once or several times. After the birth there is no more contact. A semi-open adoption may remain as it is or it can become either open or closed. A closed adoption is where only the medical and historical information about the biological parents is given to the adoptive family. Typically, the birth and adoptive parents do not know each other's identities. The record of the birth parents is kept sealed . A closed adoption is usually only effective in the adoption of babies. The adoption of an older child who already knows his or her birth parents cannot be kept closed. Question: How many adoption types are mentioned in the passage? Options: A: 2. B: 3. C: 4. D: 5.

The UK voted to leave the EU in the June referendum. Paul Johnson, IFS director, said there was a big difference between access and membership of the single market. \\"We've heard a lot of people saying of course we'll have access if we leave the single market union. \\"Broadly speaking, yes, we will, as every other country in the world does. You can export into the EU wherever you are from, but there are different sorts of barriers to doing so.\\" The IFS report said access to the single market was \\"virtually meaningless as a concept\\" because \\"any country in the World Trade Organization - from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe - had 'access' to the EU as an export destination\\". Five models for post-Brexit UK trade Who has access to the single market? The IFS report argued that the special advantage of being an EU member was that its single market reduced or eliminated barriers to trading in services, such as the need for licences or other regulations. The IFS said that the absence of trade barriers for services was far more important than removing tariffs on the trade in goods between EU members, such as customs checks and import taxes. It said that while leaving the EU would free the UK from having to make a budgetary contribution of Â£8bn, loss of trade could depress tax receipts by a larger amount. It found new trade deals would be unlikely to make up for lost EU trade, which accounts for 44% of British exports and 39% of service exports. The government has yet to start negotiating the UK's departure. The IFS issued stark warnings over the impact of Brexit ahead of the EU referendum, which have made some question its views. Mr Johnson said he hoped the IFS was proved wrong. \\"We wait to see what the economic consequences are going to be, but we've already seen the Bank of England significantly reduce its predictions of growth over the next couple of years and increase its view of where unemployment will be,\\" he added. The report said UK services would be particularly vulnerable if the government were unable or unwilling to negotiate a replacement deal and become a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), like Norway. The IFS report added that financial services, which generate 8% of the UK's economic output, might suffer in particular if a final Brexit deal meant they lost their so-called \\"passporting rights\\" that allows them to be sold directly to EU customers and businesses. \\"To maintain these rights would likely require membership of the European Economic Area (EEA),\\" it said. \\"But that would come at the potentially considerable cost of submitting to future regulations designed in the EU without input from the UK. The UK may have to make some very difficult choices between the benefits from passporting and the costs of submitting to external imposed regulation.\\" The IFS explored the possibility of the UK signing its own free trade agreement with the EU, or simply adopting WTO rules. But in both cases, the report argued, such deals would still involve tariffs or other barriers to free trade in goods and services. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that the UK could face serious consequences if it opts for a \\"hard Brexit\\" and leaves the EU single market, with reduced access negatively affecting trade and UK economic growth. The IFS emphasised the importance of the single market in reducing or eliminating barriers to trading services, which make up 44% of British exports and 39% of service exports. Financial services could be specifically affected if passporting rights are lost, hindering their ability to be sold directly to EU customers and businesses. The IFS noted that new trade agreements are unlikely to make up for lost EU trade and could lead to a drop in tax receipts larger than the cancellation of the UK's £8 billion budgetary contributions to the EU."},{"instruction":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Stuart is on a coastline Stuart is a city in, and the seat of, Martin County, Florida, United States.

It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer.

Write a sentence that describes this data. Sentence:","output":"The data presented pertains to the celestial object designated as (15788) 1993 SB, which belongs to the astronomical class of objects such as asteroids or minor planets. This object is characterized by its apoapsis, which refers to the furthest point in its orbital path around its primary celestial body. In the case of (15788) 1993 SB, the apoapsis is at a significant distance of 7,715,100,000.0 kilometres from its primary body. This distance aids astronomers in determining the shape and eccentricity of the object's orbit, as well as in deriving other valuable calculations and simulations relating to its path and future trajectory. For further context, an apoapsis is a crucial measurement in celestial mechanics, the branch of astronomy that focuses on the motion of celestial objects. The term apoapsis is often tied specifically with objects in our solar system, such as comets, asteroids, and planets - reverting to the terms apogee and aphelion when discussing orbits around Earth and the Sun respectively. It signifies the highest altitude in the orbital path of a celestial body, often providing significant information about the nature of the object's orbital state, including its period and energy. Discovered in the year 1993, which lends the \\"1993 SB\\" part of its name, (15788) 1993 SB is part of a catalogue that numbers thousands of similar objects. These specific numerical and alphanumerical designations keep track of the enormous variety and quantity of celestial bodies, providing a systematized method of recording and recalling information in the vast field of astronomy. In closing, the data related to (15788) 1993 SB, with its 7,715,100,000.0 kilometres apoapsis, represents a tiny fragment of our broad understanding of celestial motion and the complex dynamics of the universe. It emphasizes the magnitude of distances within our solar system and the incredible accuracy required to study these celestial orbits.

The meaning of the word \\"right\\" changes depending on the context in which it is used, as is the case in the provided sentences. In the first sentence, \\"She is in the right,\\" the word \\"right\\" conveys a sense of correctness, morality, or justice. In this context, it refers to the fact that her position, actions, or beliefs are considered correct, morally sound, or justified by some standard. This usage of the word \\"right\\" expresses a qualitative attribute, suggesting that she is on the side of what is good and fair.

This species is distributed in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean ; in the Caribbean Sea along Brazil .","output":"Step 1: Analyze sentence structure and key phrases First sentence: \\"This species is spread in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, along Brazil in the Caribbean Sea.\\" Second sentence: \\"This species is distributed in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean; in the Caribbean Sea along Brazil.\\" Step 2: Identify key phrases and their connections In both sentences: - 'This species': the subject of the sentences, meaning they are both referring to the same thing. - 'Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic': the first listed location of the species in both sentences. - 'Caribbean Sea along Brazil': the second listed location of the species in both sentences, albeit with a slightly different word order. Step 3: Compare word order and punctuation The word order and punctuation are different, with the first sentence using a comma and the second using a semicolon. However, these differences do not significantly alter the meaning of the sentences. Step 4: Identify differences in phrasing (\\"spread\\" vs \\"distributed\\" and \\"Atlantic\\" vs \\"Atlantic Ocean\\") The first difference is the use of \\"spread\\" in the first sentence and \\"distributed\\" in the second sentence. Both words describe the location of the species across a certain area, and in this context, they can be considered synonymous. The second difference is the use of \\"the Atlantic\\" in the first sentence and \\"the Atlantic Ocean\\" in the second. Both refer to the same body of water, and the slight difference in phrasing doesn't alter the meaning. Conclusion: After analyzing the sentences and comparing their structure, key phrases, and wording, I can conclude that these two sentences from Wikipedia have the same meaning. They both convey the geographical distribution of the species, mentioning the same locations, despite some minor differences in word order, punctuation, and phrasing."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Facts: - other names: sandra jullien - years active: 1970 -- 1975 - birth name: sandra calaputti - spouse: pierre julien - birth date: 14 february 1950 - name: sandra julien - birth place: toulon , france - occupation: actress Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of sandra julien .

If he asks if you've been to a certain restaurant, don't cut off the conversation by saying no; instead say that you've heard great things about it and ask questions about his experience. It's likely this is his way of asking you for a date! If he's teasing you, play along. Enjoy his playful personality. If you say \\"no\\" to any slightly offbeat idea he may have, you will look prudish, and not like someone he wants to hang out with. Don't be overly disagreeable right away--even if you disagree. If you find out that your favorite sports teams are arch rivals, or that you fall on opposite sides of the political spectrum, don't start a fight about it. Being playful about your differences is one thing, but getting on a soap box about your views will make you look stubborn and selfish. Men love women who have a great sense of humor and who are confident enough to show it off. Though this may not be the time for knock-knock jokes, don't be afraid to throw in a joke or two if the occasion is appropriate. Show that you can laugh at yourself. No man wants a woman who takes herself too seriously--showing that you can laugh at your own foibles will show not only that you have confidence, but that you're aware of your flaws. Men don't want a girl who is \\"too perfect\\" and this will make them feel more secure about themselves. Don't be afraid to show off your brains for fear of intimidating a man. If he's the right guy, he'll be attracted by how smart you are, and will want to spend more time picking your brain. Show him your knowledge of current events, historical figures, or even your witty analysis of pop culture. If you know what you're talking about, he'll be pleased to hear you pontificate about any subject. There's a difference between sounding smart and showing off. Avoid bragging about where you went to college, what you got on the SATs ten years ago, or any other information that may make it sound like you're floating your own boat. There are plenty of confident, funny, and smart women out there, but there is only one you. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there to show what makes you who you are. If it's appropriate, tell him a funny or interesting story from your past that will give him a sense of what kind of person you are and what kind of experiences have shaped your life. Don't be afraid to share your interests. If you're teaching yourself French or are learning to ride the unicycle, tell him about it. He'll be impressed that you're marching to the beat of your own drum and will be impressed by your zest for new things. Share something about your friends or family. While you want to avoid telling him that you can't wait to introduce him to Mom and Dad after you've just exchanged names, you can say a few things about who your family and friends are to show who has influenced you to be your best possible self. Part of attracting a man is keeping him interested. If the flame of love is glowing, you should add logs to the hearth! Though you can still play coy, make sure to exchange information before you leave if the attraction is mutual. You should avoid coming on too strong, but express an interest that will make the man see that you want to spend more time with him. You'd be surprised by how shy many men are, and how happy they are when women step up and take the initiative. Unfortunately, certain men may not be attracted to you no matter how hard you try. But don't sweat it--there are plenty of men out there, and you've made yourself a better person already by following these tips! If the man you're seeking doesn't recognize your new confidence, looks, or conversational skills, then someone else will come along who will never want to leave your side. Though you may try to attract a man with all your might, his heart may be taken. Even if he's not in a serious relationship, he may have had a recent heartbreak or could be pining for someone else, and there's nothing you can do to change that. If you're rejected, play it off. There's no need for waterworks or angry text messaging if your crush doesn't reciprocate your feelings.

In preparation for entrance exams into a monastery, he received additional instruction in Greek, Hebrew, Latin and rhetoric, starting in 1782. During this time, he struck a friendship with Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, who was five years Holderlin's junior. On account of the age difference, Schelling was \\"subjected to universal teasing\\" and Holderlin protected him from abuse by older students. Also during this time, Holderlin began playing the piano and developed an interest in travel literature through exposure to Georg Forster's A Voyage Round the World. In 1784, Holderlin entered the Lower Monastery in Denkendorf and started his formal training for entry into the Lutheran ministry. At Denkendotf, he discovered the poetry of Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, and took tentative steps in composing his own verses. The earliest known letter of Holderlin's is dated 1784 and addressed to his former tutor Nathanael Kostlin. In the letter, Holderlin hinted at his wavering faith in Christianity and anxiety about his mental state. Holderlin progressed to the Higher Monastery at Maulbronn in 1786. There he fell in love with Luise Nast, the daughter of the monastery's administrator, and began to doubt his desire to join the ministry; he composed Mein Vorsatz in 1787, in which he states his intention to attain \\"Pindar's light\\" and reach \\"Klopstock-heights\\". In 1788, he read Schiller's Don Carlos on Luise Nast's recommendation. Holderlin later wrote a letter to Schiller regarding Don Carlos, stating: \\"It won't be easy to study Carlos in a rational way, since he was for so many years the magic cloud in which the good god of my youth enveloped me so that I would not see too soon the pettiness and barbarity of the world.\\" In October 1788, Holderlin began his theological studies at the Tubinger Stift, where his fellow students included Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Isaac von Sinclair and Schelling. It has been speculated that it was Holderlin who, during their time in Tubingen, brought to Hegel's attention the ideas of Heraclitus regarding the unity of opposites, which Hegel would later develop into his concept of dialectics. In 1789, Holderlin broke off his engagement with Luise Nast, writing to her: \\"I wish you happiness if you choose one more worthy than me, and then surely you will understand that you could never have been happy with your morose, ill-humoured, and sickly friend,\\" and expressed his desire to transfer out and study law but succumbed to pressure from his mother to remain in the Stift. During his time in the Stift, Holderlin was an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution; he and some colleagues from a \\"republican club\\" planted a \\"Tree of Freedom\\" in the Tubingen market square, prompting Charles Eugene, the Duke of Wurttemberg himself, to admonish the students at the seminary.

After a couple of years of experimenting, including a three-city tour by the CSKA Moscow team from Moscow in 1974, the league again staged tournaments in 1975 NASL Indoor tournament and 1976 NASL Indoor tournament. For many years Tampa Bay owner George W. Strawbridge, Jr. lobbied his fellow owners to start up a winter indoor season, but was always stone-walled. For several years, his Rowdies and several other teams used winter indoor \\"friendlies\\" as part of their training and build-up to the outdoor season. In the meantime, pressed by the rival Major Indoor Soccer League (1978-92) (MISL), which inaugurated play in 1978, two-day mini-tournaments like the 1978 NASL Skelly Indoor Invitational and the 1979 NASL Budweiser Indoor Soccer Invitational were held with varying degrees of success. The NASL finally started a full indoor league schedule, a 12-game season with 10 teams, in 1979-80 NASL Indoor season.

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. The Malegese Ocean is primarily connected to one river. This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river.

His resignation will take effect at 5 p.m. EDT.Attorney Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. announced that B. Todd Jones, the U.S. attorney in Minneapolis, will replace Melson as acting director, effective Wednesday.Despite the problems with Fast and Furious under Melson's tenure, Holder praised the outgoing acting director and his new responsibilities.\\"Ken brings decades of experience at the department and extensive knowledge in forensic science to his new role and I know he will be a valuable contributor on these issues,\\" Holder said. \\"As he moves into this new role, I want to thank Ken for his dedication to the department over the last three decades.\\"But simply transferring Melson within the Justice Department did not immediately sit well with some critics, including Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who has asked Justice officials for an accounting of all Fast and Furious cases in Texas.\\"Instead of reassigning those responsible for Fast and Furious within the Department of Justice,\\" Cornyn said, \\"Atty. Gen. Holder should ask for their resignations and come clean on all alleged gun-walking operations, including a detailed response to allegations of a Texas-based scheme.\\"Under Melson's leadership, ATF launched Operation Fast and Furious, through which agents were to watch -- and in some cases record on video -- illegal gun sales and then use surveillance teams and electronic eavesdropping to follow the guns and learn how the weapons were moved. The goal was to arrest cartel leaders overseeing gun smuggling on the U.S. side of the border with Mexico But the chase for guns and cartel leaders soon hit a dead end. The ATF was attempting to follow each of the weapons as they were moved from the straw men who bought them illegally at gun shops to what officials expected would be cartel higher-ups in the U.S., who would move them to Mexico.The agency, which didn't have the resources to follow so many weapons, soon lost track of many of them. When officials did follow them to the next level, the buyers of the guns often turned out to be Mexicans living legally in the U.S. and not cartel honchos.An investigation by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), uncovered emails that showed Melson was regularly briefed on the botched operation.richard.serrano@latimes.com ||||| The controversy over the Fast and Furious anti-gun-trafficking operation upended the careers of two Justice Department officials Tuesday as the interim head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was transferred to an obscure, new post and the well-connected chief federal prosecutor in Arizona resigned. ATF’s current acting director, Ken Melson, will move to Justice’s Office of Legal Policy this week to become a senior adviser on forensic science, the Justice Department said. Dennis Burke, the U.S. Attorney for Arizona who oversaw prosecutions in that state related to the Fast and Furious operation, stepped down and left the federal government. Text Size - + reset Issa: ATF actions 'felony stupid' POLITICO 44 Neither Attorney General Eric Holder’s statements nor one from Burke made direct reference to the high-profile congressional investigation or a separate Justice Department probe into the ATF-led operation, which was aimed at reducing the flow of guns to Mexican drug gangs but allegedly allowed as many as 2,000 firearms to pass into the hands of criminals. However, Holder and Burke — a prominent figure in Arizona politics — both made vague allusions to distractions currently facing federal prosecutors in Arizona. “I am grateful to Dennis for his dedication and service to the Department of Justice over these many years and commend his decision to place the interests of the U.S. Attorney’s office above all else,” Holder said. “My long tenure in public service has been intensely gratifying. It has also been intensely demanding. For me, it is the right time to move on to pursue other aspects of my career and my life and allow the office to move ahead,” Burke said in a statement confirming that he’d submitted his resignation to President Barack Obama. At a House hearing in June, ATF agents complained that their efforts to seize weapons and arrest alleged traffickers were impeded by the unwillingness of federal prosecutors in Burke’s office to intercede immediately after suspicious gun buys. The agents said prosecutors blamed judicial rulings about the evidence needed to prove gun trafficking or other crimes. Sources in Washington and Arizona said Burke was summoned for an interview on Aug. 18 by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.). Burke quickly became the focus of heated questioning and ire from Republicans, a source close to Burke said. “My understanding is it did not go well,” the source said. “The bottom line is someone’s head needed to roll. … No one at the Justice Department wanted to back him up.” Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement that Melson and Burke both acknowledged to the panel that “mistakes were made and that Operation Fast and Furious lacked adequate protections for public safety. Fresh leadership will allow ATF to move forward and focus on its vital mission of enforcing our nation’s gun laws.” A lower-ranking prosecutor who dealt with the Fast & Furious operation, Emory Hurley, was also reassigned from criminal cases to civil litigation, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. The change, which took place Monday, came at his own request, the spokeswoman said. The White House had no comment Tuesday on the personnel moves. Holder offered no reason for Melson’s reassignment, but simply noted his long tenure at the department and his expertise in forensics. Melson, a veteran federal prosecutor, took the top spot at the ATF on an interim basis in 2009 and oversaw the execution of Fast and Furious, an effort that was aimed at rooting out gun smugglers selling weapons to Mexican cartels. Investigators say the ATF lost track of as many as 2,000 guns that were sold during the operation, including two that were found near the scene of the killing of a Border Patrol agent last December. In July, Melson gave a lengthy interview to congressional investigators outside the presence of — and without advance notice to — DOJ’s legislative affairs team. In the interview, Melson said he had objected to aspects of DOJ’s plans for handing the legislative inquiries and that he had been told not to tell Congress why mid-level ATF officials with responsibility for the Fast and Furious operation were reassigned. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A man named Kenneth Melson and another man, Dennis Burke, both had important jobs in the government. They were involved in a project called Fast and Furious, which was about stopping bad people from getting guns. But the project didn't work well, and this caused many people to be unhappy with them. So, Kenneth decided to leave his current job and move to another job in the government. Dennis also decided to quit his job. Now, a new man, Todd Jones, will take Kenneth's old job to try to make things better.

During the 2000s, one of the popular magazines for teenagers was \\"Seventeen.\\" First published in 1944, this American magazine primarily targeted teenage girls and focused on fashion, beauty, health, dating, and lifestyle articles. Throughout the years, its content evolved to include advice columns, celebrity interviews, and features about different aspects of teenage life.

Other noteworthy magazines that were popular among teenagers in the 2000s include \\"J-14\\", \\"M,\\" and \\"Tiger Beat\\". These three magazines primarily focused on celebrity gossip and news about popular teen stars and musicians. J-14 (short for \\"Just for Teens\\"), for instance, regularly featured articles, quizzes, and exclusive interviews with celebrities, alongside the latest trends in fashion, beauty, and entertainment.

The close-up can be a very powerful shot, but when every scene consists of nothing but close-ups, it loses all its impact. Tony Scott has some very beautiful scenery to work with, the backdrops of Mexico, the cantinas, the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives, and the dusty towns Costner rolls through on his journey for revenge. Unfortunately we only catch quick glimpses of these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a big, giant head. Even the transition scenes where Costner is driving alone across Mexico quickly cut to a close-up. The score is over-dramatic and intrusive, dictating every emotion we should feel. The story itself should have been handled much better. Among other things, too many people pop up out of nowhere to help Costner along - it's just bad writing. It's a typical thriller storyline, but many others have taken the same premise and done outstanding things with it. Costner's No Way Out had a somewhat similar storyline, but it was a much better movie. The ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic scoring of the film.

The ugliest presidential campaign in modern American history continued through a raucous post-mortem at Harvard University, where strategists gather every four years to chew over the recently completed contest from an insiders’ vantage point. Story Continued Below The scene on Thursday was fraught, from the moment the top campaigns' top officials sat down across the room from each other. There were interruptions, accusations and plenty of cross-talk for more than two tense hours. “We’re not at a Trump rally, Corey,” Clinton chief strategist Joel Benenson snapped at one point at Trump’s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Later, Trump’s last campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, cautioned her side of the table, “Hey guys, we won. We don’t have to respond.” The \\"we won\\" line turned into something of a mantra as the night wore on. Clinton’s advisers looked pained from the start. They gulped water. They gripped their pens. They crossed their arms. They glared. Then they boiled over. After 90 minutes, when Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie called Trump’s campaign CEO, Steve Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News, “an unbelievably brilliant strategist,” an impassioned Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton’s communications director, jumped in. “If providing a platform for white supremacists makes me a brilliant tactician I am glad to have lost,” Palmieri said. “I would rather lose than win the way the guys you did.” Palmieri called Clinton’s speech in Reno denouncing the “alt-right” in August one of her “proudest” moments as shouting ensued across the room. “Do you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?” Conway snapped back. “You’re going to look me in the face and tell me that?”’ “I did, Kellyanne,” Palmieri said. “I did.” \\"Do you think you could have just had a decent message for the white working-class voters?\\" Conway said, adding to no one in particular as the conversation moved on, \\"You guys are bitter.\\" \\"I can tell you are angry, but wow,\\" Conway chided her Democratic counterparts. \\"Hashtag he's your president.\\" Clinton adviser Karen Finney retorted, \\"Hashtag if he's going to be my president he's going to need to show me that white supremacy isn't acceptable.\\" There was little consensus of what, exactly, led to the Trump victory that shocked the world. Still, Trump’s team insisted they were not nearly as surprised as the rest of the political universe. In fact, Brad Parscale, Trump’s digital director, said he had told Trump the Friday before the election that the GOP nominee was headed to victory, even as the public polls suggested otherwise. Clinton’s team blamed a tough environment in which voters wanted change, Russian medded through hacked emails, a media that they said over-scrutinized her and, mostly, FBI Director James Comey. Campaign manager Robby Mook said both of Comey’s letters in the race’s final two weeks galvanized Trump’s backers and depressed Clinton’s supporters. Trump’s team called the summer tarmac meeting between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton a “defining moment” amid the FBI investigation into her email server. “That event just played right into the hands of those Americans who felt there was a culture of corruption,” Bossie said. Conway acknowledged that Clinton had emerged from the two party conventions with momentum but said she lost it with a lackluster August schedule that saw her off the trail and on the fundraising circuit. CNN's Jake Tapper on stage with Trump Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway and Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook speak during the event titled \\"War Stories: Inside Campaign 2016\\" at the Harvard Institute of Poltiics Forum on December 1. | Getty “She got a good bump but then she almost disappeared,” Conway said. Shockingly, there was almost no discussion of the controversial October tape of Trump bragging of grabbing women by the genitals. Neither side was quick to acknowledge errors — a silence that rung especially loud on the Clinton side of the room. Her advisers steadfastly refused to admit any specific fault, as Clinton media strategist Mandy Grunwald noted multiple times that any one person's diagnosis of the ultimate problem was likely correct in a race so close. But they didn’t hesitate to point to “headwinds” that disadvantaged Clinton — a phrase used so often that Lewandowski began scoffing at it as Mook repeated it. Mook identified the WikiLeaks releases of campaign chairman John Podesta’s emails and Comey’s letters as the two points that they never anticipated, but he repeatedly declined to go in depth into his campaign’s shortcomings. “No one of those emails that was put out, no one day of that, was a game-changer in the race, however it was a low-grade fever throughout, and that was an enormous strategic disadvantage,” he said. “If you ask me what was the single greatest headwind we had in the race, it was the two letters from James Comey.\\" “In retrospect, should we have put even more in terms of schedule and perhaps unpaid communications into Michigan, Wisconsin?” he added, alluding to two states his candidate surprisingly lost. \\"Absolutely.\\" Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin combined were decided by less than 100,000 votes. One theme throughout the conference was frustrations among Trump’s foes — Republicans in the primary; Clinton in the general election — about the media, in particular the blanket coverage Trump received on cable television. “You guys only cover her when she talks about him,” Palmieri complained. On Wednesday evening, Republican campaign managers shouted down and heckled CNN president Jeff Zucker when he said that all candidates had been invited onto his airwaves. “Wrong!” shouted Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who had worked as campaign manager for her father. Later, Sanders rattled off one statistic from August 2015 that in a 10-day period Trump had been on CNN during prime time for 256 minutes, and Mike Huckabee had been on for 17 seconds. In fact, Sanders said, she got on television more when she became a Trump adviser than she could get her father on as a candidate. Mook, in particular, complained about the lack of focus on Trump refusing to release his taxes and the lack of focus on the Russian connection to the hacked Clinton emails. “The media didn’t seem willing to put that in the proper context,” he said. “No one cared,” Conway said of Trump’s taxes. When Mook insisted it wasn’t covered, she responded, “That question was vomited to me every day on TV.” The lingering frustrations were also on display on Thursday morning when lead Clinton strategists briefly sparred with two of Bernie Sanders' lead operatives over the result. \\"We probably would've won,\\" said Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver. Conway praised Sanders for “softening” Clinton up for the general election. Clinton's team acknowledged repeatedly during the afternoon session that Trump had won, but Benenson stopped when Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio noted how clear it was that the country would vote for Trump considering how many voters believe things are moving in the wrong direction. \\"Don't act like you have some popular mandate for your message,\\" said Benenson. Other Clinton aides chimed in to note that her lead in the national vote is now above 2 million. Both sides erupted. “We weren't running that way,” Conway said. “We were running for 270.\\" Grunwald captured the scene with a backhanded compliment as the conference came to a close. “I don’t think you give yourselves enough credit for the negative campaign you ran,” Grunwald said of Trump’s team, saying they had executed a “very impressive gassing of her,” citing their use of unreported Facebook ads, fake news and the National Enquirer, holding up the final pre-election edition. When Conway objected, saying Trump had closed the race on a positive note, Grunwald cut in, “Take the compliment, Kellyanne.” “I would,” Conway retorted, “if it were one.” ||||| Top officials from the Trump and Clinton campaigns clashed angrily Thursday over questions of mandates and alleged associations with white supremacists -- leaving a conference designed to draw lessons from the election turning at times into a shouting match over campaign tactics. Interested in Elections? Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest The gathering of top campaign aides to all the major presidential candidates, held at Harvard University Wednesday and Thursday, revealed raw emotions and outright anger between staffers who tangled largely from afar over a grueling campaign. During the far-ranging series of conversations, a Clinton aide called FBI Director James Comey's letters regarding the email investigation a \\"game-changer\\" and a former Trump aide said he thought the race was over after Trump criticized the war hero credentials of Sen. John McCain. Clinton aides lit into their Trump counterparts for running a campaign that a top Clinton spokesperson said provided a “platform for white supremacists,” citing bringing former Breitbart chief, Steve Bannon, on the team. “I would rather lose than win the way you guys did,” said Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri. Bannon has denied being a white nationalist and members of the Trump team have defended him. Trump has disavowed support from white supremacists and said he is the \\"least racist\\" person. “No you wouldn’t, respectfully,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway countered. She said the Clinton side was ignoring the flaws of their candidate and her campaign operation. “How about, it’s Hillary Clinton – she doesn’t connect with people,” Conway said. When Trump aides touted campaign tactics that included an aggressive candidate travel schedule -– helping power a sweep of battleground states, and a clear Electoral College victory –- Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook fired a salvo back. “I would just say, Hillary did win the popular vote,” Mook said. At latest count, Clinton led by nearly 2.5 million votes, according to the Associated Press. That provoked sighs and anger from the six Trump aides seated across from the six Clinton aides in a crowded conference room at the Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics. “Oh, God, you guys,” said David Bossie, a Trump deputy campaign manager. “Hey guys, we won -– there’s no need to respond,” Conway said. “He was the better candidate -– he won.” Countered Clinton pollster Joel Benenson: “Two-and-a-half million Americans thought she was the better candidate.” The conference revealed no consensus about how precisely Trump won -– not even from the current and former Trump aides in the room. Clinton campaign leaders rejected the notion that Trump was chosen because of his potential to lead on the economy, and they cited the desire for change as the biggest long-term obstacle they had to confront. Mook cited the letters sent by Comey regarding Clinton’s emails as a “game-changer.” “If you ask me the single biggest headwind in the race, it was the two letters from James Comey,” Mook said. “If the election had been three days later, we would have won,” Palmieri added. Palmieri said she wishes she had pushed for a fourth debate, since the Clinton campaign felt those exchanges highlighted Clinton’s superior grasp of policy. Intriguingly, Conway and Bossie said Trump would probably have agreed to another such matchup. The Clinton campaign also expressed frustration with Trump’s mastery of the media, and felt the coverage on Clinton was tougher than it should have been because of the assumption that she would win the presidency. “He got all the coverage, and you guys [in the press] only covered her when she talked about him,” Palmieri said. But they could not agree on a specific change in the campaign that might have changed the outcome. Mandy Grunwald, a senior Clinton adviser who also worked for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, said it’s fair to speculate on whether Warren or Bernie Sanders being on the ticket with Clinton would have made a difference – along with any other potential explanation, since the race wound up being so close. “My general view about the general is everybody’s right” in their diagnoses of why Clinton lost, Grunwald said. “Everybody who’s got a theory of what we should have done, knock yourselves out.” Aides to Trump’s vanquished primary opponents were similarly unable to point to strategies that might have stopped Trump, once he gained momentum after the first debate last summer. “That’s the theme of the whole primary: Nothing mattered,” said David Kochel, a former top aide to Jeb Bush. Trump aides didn’t pretend to always get their boss, either. Trump’s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, revealed that after Trump famously insulted Sen. John McCain, he advised Trump that he should apologize. When he didn’t, and instead doubled down on the remarks by slamming McCain’s record on protecting veterans, Lewandowski said he was certain a campaign tailspin was imminent. “I told my wife, I think the campaign’s over, I’m coming home,” Lewandowski said. He said he also advised Trump not to attack the judge of Mexican heritage who was presiding in a lawsuit against his Trump University venture – another piece of advice the candidate ignored. The campaign learned to trust Trump’s instincts, where the spirit of his message was more important than the literal substance. He cited the proposed Muslim ban, which Lewandowski said took days’ worth of deliberations and careful staging for it to be announced on a decommissioned aircraft carrier in South Carolina. “The media wants to focus on what the statement said,” Lewandowski said to scattered laughter from attendees, “but the visuals and the timing did not happen by happenstance.” He added: “This is the problem with the media: You guys took everything Donald Trump did so literally. And the problem with that is the American people didn’t.” Tony Fabrizio, a Trump pollster, was more blunt: “Everybody in this room needs to pull their heads out of their a----.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The Harvard University conference, where strategists gather every four years to discuss the recently completed election contest, turned into a confrontation between the Clinton and Trump teams, as tensions previously shown on the campaign trail grew stronger in what has been called the ugliest presidential campaign in modern American history.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process described above is the initiation of inhalation, which involves the contraction of the diaphragm muscle. To provide a comprehensive understanding, let's examine each of the subsequent steps in this respiratory cycle. 1. Diaphragm contraction: The diaphragm, a sheet-like muscle located beneath the lungs, contracts and moves downward. This contraction is triggered by the phrenic nerve, which sends signals from the brain to the diaphragm to initiate the breathing process. The downward movement of the diaphragm creates a negative pressure within the thoracic cavity. 2. Expansion of the lungs: As the diaphragm moves down, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, creating more room for the lungs to expand. This expansion reduces the pressure within the lungs, allowing air to flow into them. 3. Inhalation: With the diaphragm contracted and lungs expanded, air rich in oxygen is drawn into the lungs through the nose and/or mouth, the trachea, and the bronchi, finally reaching the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs within the lungs. Gas exchange - the process of swapping oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules - occurs at the alveoli, where oxygen enters the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is transferred from the bloodstream into the lungs. 4. Relaxation of the diaphragm: Once the required amount of oxygen has entered the lungs, the diaphragm relaxes and moves back upwards towards its original position. This movement reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity, and increases the pressure within the lungs. 5. Exhalation: As the diaphragm moves back up, the pressure within the lungs forces air rich in carbon dioxide out of the lungs. This exhalation occurs through the bronchi, trachea, and the nose and/or mouth. 6. Removal of carbon dioxide: During exhalation, carbon dioxide, which is a waste product resulting from cellular respiration, is removed from the body. This helps maintain a healthy balance of gases within the body, ensuring that cells receive adequate oxygen to function properly. 7. Respiratory cycle repetition: The process starts all over again, with the diaphragm contracting once more and initiating another inhalation. This continuous and involuntary cycle, known as the respiratory cycle, allows the body to take in the necessary oxygen for cellular respiration, and to remove carbon dioxide waste, thereby sustaining life. In summary, the first step of the process is the contraction of the diaphragm, which initiates inhalation and the subsequent respiratory cycle. This is an essential and continuous process that provides vital oxygen to cells, ensuring that the body remains healthy and functional."},{"instruction":"Given the following passage \\"Adventurer and poet Luís de Camões (c. 1524–1580) wrote the epic poem \\"Os Lusíadas\\" (The Lusiads), with Virgil's Aeneid as his main influence.

Borussia Dortmund duo Shinji Kagawa and Ilkay Gundogan stepped up their fitness regimes as they linked up with the rest of their teammates in training on Monday. Kagawa, who recently rejoined the German side from Manchester United after a two-year absence, was pictured alongside Gundogan and the rest of the squad with a big week fast approaching for Jurgen Klopp's side. They play SC Freiburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday before welcoming a familiar face in the shape of Arsenal in their first Champions League group stage game of the season on Tuesday. Familiar faces: Dortmund fans will be looking forward to the returns of Shinji Kagawa and Ilkay Gundogan Frustrating:","output":"Frustratingly, both Kagawa and Gundogan had been plagued by injuries and inconsistent form in recent seasons, which had impacted their on-field contributions and teamwork. Despite the setbacks, these skilled players remained important fixtures within Klopp's tactical framework, and the Dortmund manager was eager to integrate them back into the squad as soon as their fitness levels permitted. In order to expedite their return to full match fitness and bolster the team's attacking prowess, Kagawa and Gundogan embarked on specialized workout routines and rehabilitation programs. These tailored fitness regimes focused on strengthening their weak muscles, improving their agility, and enhancing their overall cardiovascular endurance. As part of their reintegration process, both players participated in multiple practice sessions with their teammates, working closely with the coaching staff to fine-tune their skills and tactics. This allowed the duo to rebuild chemistry with their fellow players, as well as adapt to any new tactical developments implemented by Jurgen Klopp. Although Borussia Dortmund had faced challenges during Kagawa and Gundogan's absence, the team had been bolstered by the emergence of talented youngsters and astute signings, allowing them to maintain a competitive presence in the Bundesliga and European football. The return of Kagawa and Gundogan would only serve to further strengthen this already-solid squad. The week's upcoming fixtures promised to be a true test of Dortmund's mettle, with SC Freiburg offering an opportunity for Kagawa and Gundogan to impress in the domestic league, potentially securing crucial points to keep pace with their rivals. However, it was the highly anticipated match-up against Arsenal in the Champions League group stage that truly captured the fans' excitement. As the city of Dortmund buzzed with anticipation, supporters eagerly awaited the return of Shinji Kagawa and Ilkay Gundogan, as their involvement could offer the team a major boost against their European counterparts. With Jurgen Klopp tactically astute and always able to squeeze the best out of his players in high stakes games, the combination of exciting talents and a reinvigorated Kagawa-Gundogan partnership held the potential to propel Borussia Dortmund to success on both domestic and international stages. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage is to emphasize the importance of these two gifted players returning to full fitness for Borussia Dortmund and how their return will positively affect the team's performances in the upcoming fixtures. With both players ready to make their mark and re-establish themselves as vital contributors, the stage was set for thrilling encounters that could reignite Borussia Dortmund's quest for dominance in both the Bundesliga and Champions League."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Activation of budget guarantees 5 4.1 Payments from cash resources 5 4.2 Activation of the Guarantee Fund 5 5.\\" to Czech?","output":"1.

Terms sometimes used synonymously but with more precise meanings are: cryptic species for two or more species hidden under one species name, sibling species for two cryptic species that are each other's closest relative, and species flock for a group of closely related species living in the same habitat. As informal taxonomic ranks, species group, species aggregate, and superspecies are also in use. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011. - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - The plural (abbreviated ), in many languages, is one of the values of the grammatical category of number. Plural of nouns typically denote a quantity other than the default quantity represented by a noun, which is generally one (the form that represents this default quantity is said to be of \\"singular\\" number). Most commonly, therefore, plurals are used to denote two or more of something, although they may also denote more than fractional, zero or negative amounts. An example of a plural is the English word \\"cats\\", which corresponds to the singular \\"cat\\". - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - FOSSIL is a standard protocol for allowing serial communication for telecommunications programs under the DOS operating system. FOSSIL is an acronym for \\"Fido Opus SEAdog Standard Interface Layer\\". \\"Fido\\" refers to FidoBBS, \\"Opus\\" refers to Opus-CBCS BBS, and \\"SEAdog\\" refers to a Fidonet compatible mailer. The standards document that defines the FOSSIL protocol is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee. - In ecology, a niche is a term with a variety of meanings related to the behavior of a species living under specific environmental conditions. The ecological niche describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors (for example, by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (for example, limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey). \\"The type and number of variables comprising the dimensions of an environmental niche vary from one species to another [and] the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a species may vary according to the geographic and biotic contexts\\". - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - In biology, offspring are the young born of living organisms, produced either by a single organism or, in the case of sexual reproduction, two organisms. Collective offspring may be known as a brood or progeny in a more general way. This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the chicks hatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the honeybee. - Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis. - In biological classification , rank is the relative level of a group of organisms ( a taxon ) in a taxonomic hierarchy . Examples of taxonomic ranks are species , genus , family , class , kingdom , etc. A given rank subsumes under it less general categories , that is , more specific descriptions of life forms . Above it , each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of traits or features from common ancestors . The rank of any species and the description of its genus is basic ; which means that to identify a particular organism , it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two . Consider a particular species , the red fox Vulpes vulpes : its next rank , the genus Vulpes , comprises all the ' true foxes ' . Their closest relatives are in the immediately higher rank , the family Canidae , which includes dogs , wolves , jackals , all foxes , and other caniforms ; the next higher rank , the order Carnivora , includes feliforms and caniforms ( lions , tigers , bears , hyenas , wolverines , and all those mentioned above ) , plus other carnivorous mammals . As one group of the class Mammalia , all of the above are classified among those with backbones in the Chordata phylum rank , and with them among all the animals in the Animalia kingdom rank . Finally , all of the above will find their earliest relatives somewhere in their domain rank Eukarya . The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature defines rank as : The level , for nomenclatural purposes , of a taxon in a taxonomic hierarchy ( e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank , which lies between superfamily and subfamily ) - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: , - \\"phylé\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race + - \\"genetikós\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree) a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes. - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping. - Ecdysozoa is a group of protostome animals, including Arthropoda (insects, chelicerata, crustaceans, and myriapods), nematoda, and several smaller phyla. They were first defined by Aguinaldo \\"et al.\\" in 1997, based mainly on phylogenetic trees constructed using 18S ribosomal RNA genes. A large study in 2008 by Dunn \\"et al.\\" strongly supported the Ecdysozoa as a clade, that is, a group consisting of a common ancestor and all its descendants. - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - Nomenclature codes or codes of nomenclature are the various rulebooks that govern biological taxonomic nomenclature, each in their own broad field of organisms. To an end-user who only deals with names of species, with some awareness that species are assignable to families, it may not be noticeable that there is more than one code, but beyond this basic level these are rather different in the way they work. - In biological classification, subspecies (abbreviated \\"subsp.\\" or \\"ssp.\\"; \\"plural\\": \\"subspecies\\") is either a taxonomic rank subordinate to species, or a taxonomic unit in that rank. A subspecies cannot be recognized independently: a species will either be recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two (including any that are extinct). - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.

But I can use this background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).

He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. Howard was born and raised in Texas. He spent most of his life in the town of Cross Plains, with some time spent in nearby Brownwood. Context: Howard was born January 22, 1906 in Peaster, Texas, the only son of a traveling country physician, Dr. Isaac Mordecai Howard, and his wife, Hester Jane Ervin Howard. His early life was spent wandering through a variety of Texas cowtowns and boomtowns: Dark Valley (1906), Seminole (1908), Bronte (1909), Poteet (1910), Oran (1912), Wichita Falls (1913), Bagwell (1913), Cross Cut (1915), and Burkett (1917). During Howard's youth his parents' relationship began to break down. The Howard family had problems with money which may have been exacerbated by Isaac Howard investing in get-rich-quick schemes. Hester Howard, meanwhile, came to believe that she had married below herself. Soon the pair were actively fighting. Hester did not want Isaac to have anything to do with their son. She had a particularly strong influence on her son's intellectual growth. She had spent her early years helping a variety of sick relatives, contracting tuberculosis in the process. She instilled in her son a deep love of poetry and literature, recited verse daily and supported him unceasingly in his efforts to write. Other experiences would later seep into his prose. Although he loved reading and learning, he found school to be confining and began to hate having anyone in authority over him. Experiences watching and confronting bullies revealed the omnipresence of evil and enemies in the world, and taught him the value of physical strength and violence. Being the son of the local doctor gave Howard frequent exposure to the effects of injury and violence, due to accidents on farms and oil fields combined with the massive increase in crime that came with the oil boom. Firsthand tales of gunfights, lynchings, feuds, and Indian raids developed his distinctly Texan, hardboiled outlook on the world. Sports, especially boxing, became a passionate preoccupation. At the time, boxing was the most popular sport in the country, with a cultural influence far in excess of what it is today. James J. Jeffries, Jack Johnson, Bob Fitzsimmons, and later Jack Dempsey were the names that inspired during those years, and he grew up a lover of all contests of violent, masculine struggle. Question: where was he going Answer:","output":"The information provided does not specify a particular destination for Robert Ervin Howard. However, it describes his early life as spent wandering through various Texas towns, such as Dark Valley, Seminole, Bronte, Poteet, Oran, Wichita Falls, Bagwell, Cross Cut, and Burkett, due to his father's occupation as a traveling country physician.

Yun studied forest soils, while Jian studied grassland soil. They were both very surprised with they findings. and a hint : In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as uploading and downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users through email, public message boards, and sometimes via direct chatting. Many BBSes also offer on-line games, in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide chat rooms, allowing users to interact with each other. Bulletin board systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the World Wide Web, social networks and other aspects of the Internet. Low-cost, high-performance modems drove the use of online services and BBSes through the early 1990s. \\"Infoworld\\" estimated there were 60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States alone in 1994, a collective market much larger than major online services like CompuServe. - In the United States, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the area. Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be, nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states. As such, the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source. A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region (e.g., Chicago or Atlanta). However, some metropolitan areas contain more than one large city with no single municipality holding a substantially dominant position (e.g., DallasFort Worth metroplex, Norfolk-Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), RiversideSan Bernardino (Inland Empire) or MinneapolisSaint Paul). - Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave frequencies, generally , just above the medium wave AM broadcast band. - A modem (modulator-demodulator) is a network hardware device that modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data. Modems can be used with any means of transmitting analog signals, from light emitting diodes to radio. A common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data. - Indiana is a U.S. state located in the midwestern and Great Lakes regions of North America. Indiana is the 38th largest by area and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Its capital and largest city is Indianapolis.

It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - The Midwestern United States, also referred to as the American Midwest or simply the Midwest, is one of the four geographic regions defined by the United States Census Bureau, occupying the northern central part of the United States of America. It was officially named the North Central region by the Census Bureau until 1984. - CompuServe (CompuServe Information Service, also known by its acronym CIS) was the first major commercial online service provider in the United States. It dominated the field during the 1980s and remained a major influence through the mid-1990s. At its peak in the early 1990s, CIS was known for its online chat system, message forums covering a variety of topics, extensive software libraries for most computer platforms, and a series of popular online games, notably MegaWars III and Island of Kesmai.

He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. - Electronic mail, or email, is a method of exchanging digital messages between people using digital devices such as computers, tablets and mobile phones. Email first entered substantial use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email. Email operates across computer networks, which in the 2010s is primarily the Internet. Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time, in common with instant messaging. Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect only briefly, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages. - Medium wave (MW) is the part of the medium frequency (MF) radio band used mainly for AM radio broadcasting. For Europe the MW band ranges from 526.5 kHz to 1606.5 kHz, using channels spaced every 9 kHz, and in North America an extended MW broadcast band ranges from 525 kHz to 1705 kHz, using 10 kHz spaced channels. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful.

What was the overall consensus about the movie?","output":"The overall consensus about the movie \\"Winter Sleep\\" is predominantly positive, with most reviews praising the film's intellectual depth, rich storytelling, strong performances, and remarkable cinematography. The movie is appreciated for its psychologically complex characters, thought-provoking themes of conscience, responsibility, and self-deception, as well as its aesthetic beauty. Several reviews compared the film to great literary masterpieces, specifically Chekhov's plays, emphasizing the film's capacity to engage viewers with an engrossing narrative. The powerful, poignant, and sometimes intense conversations between characters are also highlighted as a strong point in the film. Additionally, the stunning visuals and artistry are praised as they allow viewers to truly immerse themselves in the story. However, there are some mild criticisms of \\"Winter Sleep,\\" with some reviewers finding the movie's 196-minute runtime to be somewhat challenging, suggesting that it may not appeal to those who prefer action-packed films or those with shorter attention spans. A few found aspects of the performances or the narrative unable to reach the full tragic dimensions the creators aimed for, but these criticisms seem to be exceptions to the overall positive reception.

Jeff Sessions signalled in a memo filed to a federal court that “consent decrees” such as those struck in recent years with troubled departments in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, could be scrapped or scaled down. “It is not the responsibility of the federal government to manage non-federal law enforcement agencies,” Sessions said in the memo. Sessions said he had instructed senior officials to reexamine all formal agreements between the department of justice (DoJ) and police agencies – from training initiatives, to collaborative reform programs, to legal consent decrees – to ensure they fit his series of operating principles for his department. These included: “The misdeeds of individual bad actors should not impugn or undermine the legitimate and honorable work that law enforcement officers and agencies perform in keeping American communities safe.” The NAACP’s legal defense fund slammed the move, calling it “a blatant attempt by the justice department to abandon its obligations under federal civil rights law and the US constitution”. US attorney dismissed by Trump speaks out on Chicago's need for police reform Read more In a statement, the ACLU also took issue with the attorney general’s suggestion that abuse within police departments was attributable to “the misdeeds of individual bad actors”. “There is no national census of police misconduct to support the DOJ’s notion that there are only a few bad actors in law enforcement. Indeed, DOJ’s own investigative reports over the past eight years document systemic unlawful policing practices of local law enforcement in cities across the country.” Sessions, a hardline conservative who was previously a US senator for Alabama, has frequently accused the Obama administration of unfairly maligning all police because of the use of arguably excessive force by officers in a handful of high-profile lethal cases. Sessions made clear during his confirmation hearings in Washington in January that he was prepared to weaken legal reform agreements in order to hand authority back to local police chiefs. Consent decrees are court-enforced lists of reforms that are typically struck when justice department civil rights investigators discover a “pattern or practice” of unconstitutional policing by a department. A total of 25 such investigations were opened under the Obama administration. Sessions has repeatedly expressed unease about such agreements, saying he believes the federal government has too frequently interfered with local policing. Federal officials are currently enforcing 19 agreements, according to a report released earlier this year. This includes several reached by the Obama administration with cities such as Cleveland; Newark, New Jersey; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The new Sessions memo was filed to court in Maryland in the case of the justice department’s consent decree with police in Baltimore. Attorneys for the justice department asked the court for a 90-day pause so it could “review and assess” the plan. Trump breaks from Obama with crime crackdown and 'blue lives matter' protections Read more The agreement was reached following severe unrest in the city following the death in April 2015 of Freddie Gray, a 24-year-old black man who died from a broken neck sustained in the back of a Baltimore police van. Baltimore officers had faced a series of allegations of misconduct and brutality in previous years. The consent decree with Ferguson grew out of the scathing findings of an inquiry prompted by unrest around the fatal police shooting of unarmed black 18-year-old Michael Brown in August 2014. It demands that the Missouri city overhaul its criminal justice system and refocus its policing on de-escalation and avoiding the use of force. Changes to consent decrees would need to be proposed in court by justice department officials and approved by a federal judge. In a statement on Monday night, Catherine Pugh, Baltimore’s mayor, said: “We strongly oppose any delay in moving forward.” She said a delay “may have the effect of eroding the trust that we are working hard to establish”. During the presidential campaign, Trump earned the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police union, and the move is likely to be popular among police officers. “I think most rank and file police officers will welcome this news,” said Jim Bueermann, a former California police chief and the head of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on policing research. “I think most street cops believe that the federal government has not been fair to them and finds the consent decree process to be intrusive.” Police chiefs, in contrast, sometimes welcome the role of the justice department, since court-mandated reforms can be a way of forcing city governments to pay for changes, Bueermann added. With the future of Chicago’s consent decree in limbo, the Chicago police department has pledged to move ahead with reforms regardless of what role the federal government plays. But in a blunt open letter, Chicago’s outgoing US attorney said that city leaders could not be trusted to fulfilthe needed reforms, and the police department needed a consent decree. Recent justice department investigations into policing in Chicago and Baltimore found evidence to support what many black residents of those cities already believed: that local police departments had engaged in a pattern of unconstitutional policing. The investigations found evidence of stark racial disparities in police enforcement, excessive force, and patterns of unjustified stops, searches and arrests. In Baltimore, the investigation’s final report described: “Two Baltimores: one wealthy and largely white, the second impoverished and predominantly black. Community members living in the city’s wealthier and largely white neighbourhoods told us that officers tend to be respectful and responsive to their needs, while many individuals living in the city’s largely African-American communities informed us that officers tend to be disrespectful and do not respond promptly to their calls for service.” Phillip Atiba Goff, a leading researcher on racial bias in policing, called Sessions’ move “a terrible blow” to efforts to build trust between police and communities. “Without the help of a federal consent decree, police executives often cannot effect the changes they know a department needs, changes designed to build trust with communities that are skeptical of their law enforcement. “Ultimately, I fear that this new direction from DOJ will make communities less safe by making them less trusting – possibly setting us back years or more.” ||||| WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a sweeping review of federal agreements with dozens of law enforcement agencies, an examination that reflects President Trump’s emphasis on law and order and could lead to a retreat on consent decrees with troubled police departments nationwide. In a memorandum dated March 31 and made public Monday, the attorney general directed his staff to look at whether law enforcement programs adhere to principles put forth by the Trump administration, including one declaring that “the individual misdeeds of bad actors should not impugn” the work police officers perform “in keeping American communities safe.” As part of its shift in emphasis, the Justice Department went to court on Monday to seek a 90-day delay in a consent decree to overhaul Baltimore’s embattled Police Department. That request came just days before a hearing, scheduled for Thursday in the United States District Court in Baltimore, to solicit public comment on the agreement, which was reached in principle by the city and the Justice Department in the waning days of the Obama administration. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a nationwide review of all reform agreements with local police departments, casting doubt on part of former President Barack Obama's criminal justice legacy.

Q: Cops aren't gonna help you. A:","output":"Step 1: Read and understand the given English sentence. The sentence given is \\"Cops aren't gonna help you.\\" Step 2: Break the sentence down into its individual components. - Cops (noun) - aren't (contraction of \\"are not,\\" a negation with a helping verb) - gonna (informal contraction of \\"going to,\\" which indicates future action) - help (verb) - you (pronoun) Step 3: Identify the Telugu translations for each component. - Cops: పోలీసులు (Pōlīsulu) - aren't: కారు (Kāru), అంటే అరే చేయరు - gonna: ఉండటానికి (Uṇḍaṭāniki) - help: సహాయం (Sahāyaṁ) - you: మీరు (Mīru) Step 4: Combine the Telugu translations to construct the Telugu sentence. Keeping the word order similar to the English sentence and considering the appropriate usage of verbs, the translated sentence in Telugu would be: పోలీసులు మీకు సహాయం చేయరు. (Pōlīsulu mīku sahāyaṁ ceyaru.) This Telugu sentence translates to \\"Cops aren't gonna help you.\\" in English."},{"instruction":"Gilford is a town in Belknap County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 7,126 at the 2010 census. Situated on Lake Winnipesaukee, Gilford is home to Governors Island, Ellacoya State Beach, Belknap Mountain State Forest, Gunstock Mountain Ski Resort, and Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion at Meadowbrook, a seasonal outdoor concert venue. Can we draw the following conclusion? There are freshwater sources near Gilford. Choices: [-] Yes; [-] It's impossible to say; [-] No;","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that there are freshwater sources near Gilford. This conclusion can be inferred from the information provided about the town's geographical features and attractions. The presence of Lake Winnipesaukee, which is a well-known freshwater lake in New Hampshire, indicates that there are freshwater sources in the vicinity of Gilford. Covering an area of 71 square miles, Lake Winnipesaukee is not only the largest lake in the state, but it also provides recreational activities for residents and tourists, such as fishing, boating, and swimming. Furthermore, Gilford is home to Ellacoya State Beach, which is situated on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee. Additionally, Gilford's location near Belknap Mountain State Forest implies the existence of other freshwater sources in the region, such as streams and rivers flowing through or near the forest. The town's proximity to Gunstock Mountain Ski Resort also supports this conclusion, as it is likely that the mountains in the area would have freshwater sources, such as snowmelt and groundwater. In conclusion, based on the available information about Gilford's geographical features and attractions, it can be inferred that there are freshwater sources near the town."},{"instruction":"Information: - The Right Honourable (The Rt Hon. or Rt Hon.) is an honorific style traditionally applied to certain persons and to certain collective bodies in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, some other Commonwealth realms, the Anglophone Caribbean, Mauritius and occasionally elsewhere. \\"Right\\" in this context is an adverb meaning \\"to a great extent or degree\\".

Although not defined by universally accepted formal boundaries, the River Lea can be considered the eastern boundary. For the purposes of his book, \\"East End Past\\", Richard Tames regards the area as coextensive with the London Borough of Tower Hamlets: however, he acknowledges that this narrow definition excludes parts of southern Hackney, such as Shoreditch and Hoxton, which many would regard as belonging to the East End. Others again, such as Alan Palmer, would extend the area across the Lea to include parts of the London Borough of Newham; while parts of the London Borough of Waltham Forest are also sometimes included. It is universally agreed, however, that the East End is to be distinguished from East London, which covers a much wider area. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Old Street is a street in central and east London that runs west to east from Goswell Road in Clerkenwell, in the London Borough of Islington, to the crossroads where it meets Shoreditch High Street (south), Kingsland Road (north) and Hackney Road (east) in Shoreditch in the London Borough of Hackney. - Shoreditch High Street is the old main street of Shoreditch, London. It is part of the A10 road and connects Norton Folgate to the south with Kingsland Road to the north.

Often - but not always - communities share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood). Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions like family, home, work, government, society, or humanity, at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties (micro-level), \\"community\\" may also refer to large group affiliations (or macro-level), such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities. - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south.

The tragic sequence of events that led to this situation stems from the overarching rivalry and animosity between the two major street gangs in the narrative. West Side Story is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, set in New York City during the 1950s. The Sharks and Jets represent the Montagues and Capulets, respectively, in embedding the feud component from the classic play. Racial tensions predominantly drove the conflict between the two gangs. During the theatrical development, the character of Bernardo is portrayed as a strong, proud, and courageous individual. As the Sharks' leader, he feels a sense of responsibility to protect his fellow members from the inherent discrimination they experience as immigrants in the United States. Love eventually plays a role in exacerbating the conflict between the two gangs when Bernardo's sister, Maria, falls in love with one of the Jets, Tony. The drama-igniting killing occurs during the protagonist's intention to stage a \\"war council\\" in which the feud's climactic rumble would be deliberated. Despite initial intentions to enact a \\"fair fight\\" showdown, unforeseen, tense circumstances provoke Bernardo into killing Riff. In response to the shocking death of his best friend, Tony retaliates and kills Bernardo. Bernardo's tragic death is a pivotal moment in West Side Story, adding increased tension and emotional stakes to the already intense tale of love and rivalry. The story's portrayal of the consequences of racial prejudice and gang violence serves as a cautionary tale, urging audiences to reassess their judgments and prejudices towards others."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Q: Which factor ruins renewable resources like soil and water?

This choice is also not directly linked to the harm of renewable resources. - Careless human action: This term refers to actions performed without proper thought or consideration of their consequences. This choice is the most relevant choice in relation to the question, as careless actions can negatively impact the environment and renewable resources.

Step 1: Analyze the premise We have a piece of information about a person who is currently climbing a rocky mountainside. This activity implies that the person is engaging in an outdoor activity and appears to have some level of physical ability. Step 2: Examine the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that the person loves the outdoors, which implies a strong affinity or preference for engaging in outdoor activities. Step 3: Consider the relationship between the premise and hypothesis The premise presents information that is supportive of the hypothesis but does not guarantee its accuracy. One action of climbing a mountain does not necessarily mean that the person loves the outdoors. It could be a one-time activity or even a challenge they're facing reluctantly. Conclusion: The hypothesis is not definitively entailed by the premise. While it's plausible that the person loves the outdoors based on their current activity, it's not conclusively proven.

A:","output":"In response to the question \\"what is when water vapor moves from plants and falls to the earth's surface as rain and snow?\\", it is not accurate to simply answer with \\"condensation.\\" This is because the process described in the question encompasses multiple concepts related to the water cycle, including transpiration, evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Let me provide you with an in-depth explanation of these processes to clarify why condensation alone is not the correct answer. Transpiration: This is the process by which water vapor is released from plants, mainly through their leaf stomata. It is an essential component of the water cycle, as it helps plants to absorb nutrients from the soil, cool themselves, and maintain their internal water balance. Evaporation: Water from various sources, including surface water, soil, and plants, turns into vapor and rises into the atmosphere. Evaporation is heavily influenced by factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind. Condensation: This process occurs when water vapor in the atmosphere cools and turns into a liquid state, forming clouds. It is essential to understand that condensation is a separate process from transpiration, and while it is a significant part of the water cycle, it does not involve water vapor moving directly from plants to the earth's surface as rain or snow. Precipitation: Precipitation occurs when water droplets in clouds combine, become heavy, and eventually fall to the earth's surface as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. This is the phase when the water vapor that was initially released from the plants through transpiration and evaporated water, now condensed into clouds, returns to the earth's surface. To sum up, the answer to the question is more complex than merely stating \\"condensation.\\" Instead, a more accurate response would be that the process of water vapor moving from plants and falling to the earth's surface as rain and snow involves multiple stages within the water cycle, including transpiration, evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. All these processes work in tandem to maintain the continuous movement of water within the atmosphere, on the earth's surface, and underground."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task you are given a sentence with one coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so).

And then you discover that everybody's very upset that he's done it.\\" His death divided national newspapers, with the Daily Mirror branding him a \\"cold coward\\" and condemning the Prison Service for allowing his suicide to happen. The Sun, however, ran a celebratory front-page headline; \\"Ship Ship hooray!\\" The Independent called for the inquiry into Shipman's suicide to look more widely at the state of Britain's prisons as well as the welfare of inmates. In The Guardian, an article by Sir David Ramsbotham (former Chief Inspector of Prisons) suggested that whole life sentencing be replaced by indefinite sentencing as these would at least give prisoners the hope of eventual release and reduce the risk of their ending their own lives by suicide as well as making their management easier for prison officials. Shipman's motive for suicide was never established, although he had reportedly told his probation officer that he was considering suicide to assure his wife's financial security after he was stripped of his National Health Service (NHS) pension. Primrose Shipman received a full NHS pension, to which she would not have been entitled had Shipman lived past age 60. Additionally, there was evidence that his wife, who had consistently protested Shipman's innocence despite the overwhelming evidence, had begun to suspect his guilt. Shipman had refused to take part in courses leading toward a full confession of his crimes, leading to temporary removal of privileges, including the opportunity to telephone his wife. During this period, according to Shipman's cellmate, he received a letter from Primrose exhorting him to \\"tell me everything, no matter what\\". A 2005 inquiry found that Shipman's suicide \\"could not have been predicted or prevented\\", but that procedures should nonetheless be re-examined. Answer this question \\"Was there any other interesting information regarding his death?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, there was other interesting information regarding his death. After Shipman's suicide, there were mixed reactions from the public and the media. His death also raised questions about the state of Britain's prisons, inmate welfare, and the potential need for changes in sentencing. Additionally, Shipman's motive for suicide was never established but it was speculated that it could be related to his wife's financial security and her potential changing beliefs about his guilt. A 2005 inquiry found that his suicide could not have been predicted or prevented but suggested a re-examination of procedures."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What philosophical movement rejects Enlightenment thinking and was pioneered by a Kashmiri poet? The answer is:","output":"The philosophical movement that rejects Enlightenment thinking and was pioneered by a Kashmiri poet is Romanticism. This movement emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as a response to the rationalism and scientific approach of the Enlightenment era. Romanticism emphasizes emotion, imagination, and individualism and seeks to rediscover the beauty and mysticism in nature and human experiences. The Kashmiri poet you refer to is probably Sheikh Noor-ud-din Noorani, also known as Nunda Rishi or Sheikh ul-Alam, who was a 14th-century Kashmiri mystic and poet. Sheikh Noor-ud-din Noorani was one of the founders of the Rishi order, a mystical tradition in Kashmir that predates Romanticism by a few centuries. Although the Rishi tradition and Romanticism share some similarities, they are not completely identical, since the Rishi order is a spiritual tradition, while Romanticism is a broader philosophical and artistic movement. It is essential to clarify that while Sheikh Noor-ud-din Noorani shares some themes with Romanticism, he did not directly contribute to the Romantic movement. The European Romantic movement was pioneered by poets and philosophers like William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, among others, who were mainly influenced by European historical factors and intellectual traditions. In summary, Romanticism is the philosophical movement that rejects Enlightenment thinking. While the Kashmiri poet Sheikh Noor-ud-din Noorani did not directly pioneer Romanticism, his mystical poetry and teachings resonate with some key themes of the Romantic movement, such as the emphasis on emotion, imagination, and the contemplation of nature."},{"instruction":"Review: What a muddled mess.

Context: I think that one of the people who caused me the most misery for the longest was someone that I’ll call “Luna”. So, most people have probably met that person that acts all suicidal and then uses that against you. For example, you’re talking to someone like that and you’re having some sort of argument and the moment they realize they aren’t winning they send you pictures of their bloodied wrists and say “This is your fault”. Well, that person was my friend for a long time. Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do “something bad” and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive. So most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she’d be happy because her life wasn’t worsened at all. But I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing. But I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only “friend” at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade. So for that entire period of time, she certainly wasn’t the only source of misery for me, but she made me feel way worse than I would have if I hadn’t been friends with her.

Prolific throughout his short life, he wrote notable works in the Realist tradition as well as early examples of American Naturalism and Impressionism. He is recognized by modern critics as one of the most innovative writers of his generation. The ninth surviving child of Methodist parents, Crane began writing at the age of four and had published several articles by the age of 16. Stephen Crane's fiction is typically categorized as representative of Naturalism, American realism, Impressionism or a mixture of the three. Critic Sergio Perosa, for example, wrote in his essay, \\"Stephen Crane fra naturalismo e impressionismo,\\" that the work presents a \\"symbiosis\\" of Naturalistic ideals and Impressionistic methods. When asked whether or not he would write an autobiography in 1896, Crane responded that he \\"dare not say that I am honest. I merely say that I am as nearly honest as a weak mental machinery will allow.\\" Similarities between the stylistic techniques in Crane's writing and Impressionist painting--including the use of color and chiaroscuro--are often cited to support the theory that Crane was not only an Impressionist but also influenced by the movement. H. G. Wells remarked upon \\"the great influence of the studio\\" on Crane's work, quoting a passage from The Red Badge of Courage as an example: \\"At nightfall the column broke into regimental pieces, and the fragments went into the fields to camp. Tents sprang up like strange plants. Camp fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted the night.... From this little distance the many fires, with the black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays, made weird and satanic effects.\\" Although no direct evidence exists that Crane formulated a precise theory of his craft, he vehemently rejected sentimentality, asserting that \\"a story should be logical in its action and faithful to character. Truth to life itself was the only test, the greatest artists were the simplest, and simple because they were true.\\" Poet and biographer John Berryman suggested that there were three basic variations, or \\"norms\\", of Crane's narrative style. The first, being \\"flexible, swift, abrupt and nervous\\", is best exemplified in The Red Badge of Courage, while the second (\\"supple majesty\\") is believed to relate to \\"The Open Boat\\", and the third (\\"much more closed, circumstantial and 'normal' in feeling and syntax\\") to later works such as The Monster. Crane's work, however, cannot be determined by style solely on chronology. Not only does his fiction not take place in any particular region with similar characters, but it varies from serious in tone to reportorial writing and light fiction. Crane's writing, both fiction and nonfiction, is consistently driven by immediacy and is at once concentrated, vivid and intense. The novels and short stories contain poetic characteristics such as shorthand prose, suggestibility, shifts in perspective and ellipses between and within sentences. Similarly, omission plays a large part in Crane's work; the names of his protagonists are not commonly used and sometimes they are not named at all. Crane was often criticized by early reviewers for his frequent incorporation of everyday speech into dialogue, mimicking the regional accents of his characters with colloquial stylization. This is apparent in his first novel, in which Crane ignored the romantic, sentimental approach of slum fiction; he instead concentrated on the cruelty and sordid aspects of poverty, expressed by the brashness of the Bowery's crude dialect and profanity, which he used lavishly. The distinct dialect of his Bowery characters is apparent at the beginning of the text; the title character admonishes her brother saying: \\"Yeh knows it puts mudder out when yes comes home half dead, an' it's like we'll all get a poundin'.\\" Ask a question about this article.","output":"Stephen Crane was a famous writer from a long time ago who wrote poems, stories, and novels. He was known for writing in different styles like Realism, Naturalism, and Impressionism, which helped make his work really special and unique. Sometimes he wrote in a way that showed you the world as it really was, and other times he painted pictures with his words, like an artist would do with colors on a canvas. One of his most famous books is called \\"The Red Badge of Courage.\\" People really liked how he wrote about the feelings of soldiers during a war. Stephen also wrote about everyday people and their lives, but he didn't sugarcoat it. He showed the tough and ugly parts of life, too. And when his characters talked, he made them sound like real people, using the way they would really speak. People keep talking and studying about Stephen Crane today because he was really good at telling stories in different ways, and he knew how to make them feel real and alive."},{"instruction":"In this task, positions of two consecutive words have been swapped.

Answer the above question based on the context below: During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus.

Logan earns more money per year than Brian because Select from: (i) Logan has an extremely well-paying job.; (ii) Brian has an extremely well-paying job.; Answer:","output":"Logan earns more money per year than Brian because Logan has an extremely well-paying job. Having a well-paying job often means that an individual has pursued a career in a high-demand, specialized, or competitive field, which in turn has led them to secure a position with a significantly higher salary than those in other professions. In Logan's case, his dedication, hard work, and acquired skills have granted him the opportunity to land an extraordinarily lucrative role, resulting in an annual income surpassing that of Brian. On the other hand, even though Brian may also have a well-paying job, the income he earns annually does not exceed that of Logan. Brian's career path might involve less specialization or lower market demand for his skills, which could partly explain the discrepancy in their earnings. Additionally, factors like experience, education, and specific job responsibilities can contribute to the variation in their income levels. Nevertheless, it's essential to consider that earning a significant income is not the sole measure of one's success or happiness. Both Logan and Brian may derive satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment from their respective professions, regardless of the difference in monetary compensation. Furthermore, one must take into account external factors affecting these individuals' work-life balance, such as job security, benefits, and overall job satisfaction. It's possible that both Logan and Brian have made respective career choices based on personal values, interests, and goals – not simply by the financial rewards they receive.

The game was actually invented in Germany. Chinese Checkers is a modern version of an older game called Halma, which was developed in the late 19th century by an American named George Howard Monks. Halma is a board game played on a square or diamond-shaped board with 16 spaces on each side. The goal of the game is to move all of one's pieces from their starting corner to the opposite corner before the other player does the same. In 1892, a German company called Ravensburger introduced a more simplified version of Halma called \\"Stern-Halma,\\" which translates to \\"Star-Halma.\\" This version of the game featured a star-shaped board, making it faster and easier to play compared to its predecessor. Stern-Halma became highly popular across Europe, and soon reached the United States under the name \\"Chinese Checkers\\" — a complete rebranding to make the game more marketable and exotic. Apart from being called Chinese Checkers, there is no direct influence or connection between the game and Chinese culture or history. The game only retains its name in an attempt to attract consumers and to create an air of mystique around its origins, which has led many to mistakenly believe that it was indeed created in China. To summarize, Chinese Checkers was invented in Germany, as an adaptation of the American game Halma.

Let's simplify the constant on the left side: -163362 + 89774 = -73688 And the constants on the right side: 172678 + 628454 = 801132 So the equation becomes: -73688 = -6160*s + 801132 We'll then subtract 801132 from both sides to isolate -6160*s on the right side: -73688 - 801132 = -6160*s Which simplifies to: -874820 = -6160*s Then divide both sides by -6160 to find s: s = -874820 / -6160 Solving the division gives us: s = 142 Therefore, the solution to the equation -163362 + 89774 = -6160*s + 172678 + 628454 for s is s = 142."},{"instruction":"In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question.

Load testing is a critical aspect of software testing that focuses on verifying the performance, reliability, and stability of an application or system under a specified amount of load. In more detail, load testing is essential for determining how a software system will perform under real-world conditions such as high traffic, large data volumes, and multiple simultaneous users. The goal of load testing is to identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues that may impact the end-user experience and ensure that the system is optimized to handle the expected workloads. Load testing typically involves the following processes: 1. Requirements gathering: To get started, it is crucial to gather and understand the performance requirements and objectives of an application, which may include metrics like response times, throughput, and resource utilization. 2. Test planning: In this phase, testers create a detailed plan to load-test the application, including the selection of testing tools, identification of test scenarios, definition of test data requirements, and identification of performance acceptance criteria. 3. Test design: Testers design realistic test scenarios that mimic actual user behavior, data volumes, and concurrent users to ensure that the tests cover different aspects of the system's performance under load. This may include parameterized test scripts and automation scripts for simulating users. 4. Test execution: Using load testing tools, testers inject simulated user loads and run performance tests based on the designed test scenarios. Testers monitor the system's behavior and response during the tests, collecting various performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rates. 5. Results analysis: After running the tests, testers analyze the results to identify bottlenecks, resource constraints, or other issues impacting performance. They may use various performance monitoring tools and visualizations to interpret the collected data for more in-depth analysis. 6. Optimization and tuning: Based on the findings from the analysis, the development team makes necessary changes to the system - such as optimizing code, fine-tuning server configurations, or addressing architectural flaws - to improve performance under load. 7. Re-testing: After making improvements and optimizations, testers conduct load testing again to validate that the changes yield the desired performance improvements and meet the established acceptance criteria. In conclusion, load testing is an essential method for testing software under a specific load, as it allows developers and testers to ensure the system is robust, stable, and performs well under real-world conditions with large quantities of data or a large number of users."},{"instruction":"Information: - The Persian Gulf is a mediterranean sea in Western Asia.

Woodes Rogers spent part of his childhood in Poole, England, where he likely attended the local school; his father, who owned shares in many ships, was often away nine months of the year with the Newfoundland fishing fleet. Sometime between 1690 and 1696, Captain Rogers moved his family to Bristol. In November 1697, Woodes Rogers was apprenticed to Bristol mariner John Yeamans, to learn the profession of a sailor. The ships then went to the Dutch port of Batavia in what is now Indonesia, where Rogers underwent surgery to remove a musket ball from the roof of his mouth, and the expedition disposed of the less seaworthy of the two Spanish prizes. Dealing with the Dutch there constituted a violation of the British East India Company's monopoly. When the ships finally dropped anchor in the Thames River on 14 October 1711, a legal battle ensued, with the investors paying the East India Company PS6,000 (about PS820,000 at today's values) as settlement for their claim for breach of monopoly, about four percent of what Rogers brought back. The investors approximately doubled their money, while Rogers gained PS1,600 (now worth perhaps PS218,700) from a voyage which disfigured him and cost him his brother, who was killed in a battle in the Pacific. The money was probably less than he could have made at home, and was entirely absorbed by the debts his family had incurred in his absence. However, the long voyage and the capture of the Spanish ship made Rogers a national hero. Rogers was the first Englishman, in circumnavigating the globe, to have his original ships and most of his crew survive. After his voyage, he wrote an account of it, titled A Cruising Voyage Round the World. Edward Cooke, an officer aboard Duchess, also wrote a book, A Voyage to the South Sea and Round the World, and beat Rogers to print by several months. Rogers' book was much more successful, with many readers fascinated by the account of Selkirk's rescue, which Cooke had slighted. Among those interested in Selkirk's adventure was Daniel Defoe, who appears to have read about it, and fictionalised the story as Robinson Crusoe. While Rogers' book enjoyed financial success, it had a practical purpose--to aid British navigators and possible colonists. Much of Rogers' introduction is devoted to advocacy for the South Seas trade. Rogers notes that had there been a British colony in the South Seas, he would not have had to worry about food supplies for his crew. A third of Rogers' book is devoted to detailed descriptions of the places that he explored, with special emphasis on \\"such [places] as may be of most use for enlarging our trade\\". He describes the area of the River Plate in detail because it lay \\"within the limits of the South Sea Company\\", whose schemes had not yet burst into financial scandal. Rogers' book was carried by such South Pacific navigators as Admiral George Anson and privateering captains John Clipperton and George Shelvocke.

A child actor, he made his TV debut at the age of seven, on the show Captain Video and His Video Rangers, filmed in New York. Among other acting work, he appeared in TV and radio commercials, before being offered a part in the 1954 Broadway production of the musical Fanny. Wright played the role of Cesario, the son of Fanny, who was played by future Brady Bunch matriarch Florence Henderson. Context: In 1988, Wright released Who I Am on A&M-distributed Cypress Records. Among the album's contributors were Western musicians such as Harrison, White and Keltner, a group of South Indian percussionists, and Indian classical violinists L. Subramaniam and L. Shankar. The previous year, Wright had contributed to Harrison's album Cloud Nine (1987), for which he co-wrote \\"That's What It Takes\\" with Harrison and Jeff Lynne, and played keyboards on songs such as \\"When We Was Fab\\". One of the tracks from Who I Am, \\"Blind Alley\\", was used in the 1988 horror film Spellbinder. Wright's next solo album was First Signs of Life (1995), recorded in Rio de Janeiro and at his own High Wave Studios in Los Angeles, and issued on the Triloka/Worldly record label. The album combined Brazilian rhythms with elements of African vocal tradition, creating what AllMusic's reviewer describes as \\"an infectious worldbeat hybrid\\", where \\"the musicians' performances radiate sincerity and joy\\". First Signs of Life featured guest appearances from drummer Terry Bozzio, Brazilian guitarist Ricardo Silveira and Harrison. The song \\"Don't Try to Own Me\\", co-written with Duane Hitchings, was later included on Rhino Records' Best of Gary Wright: The Dream Weaver - a 1998 compilation spanning his solo career from 1970 onwards, and featuring extensive liner notes by Wright. Human Love (1999) included new versions of \\"Wildfire\\" and \\"The Wrong Time\\", as well as \\"If You Believe in Heaven\\", a song written with Graham Gouldman that had first appeared on Best of Gary Wright. The album was co-produced by German world-music producer Marlon Klein and released on the High Wave Music label.

There, 'I'm having a dinner party' means: 'I'm booking a table for 12 at a restaurant you can't afford and we'll be sharing the checque evenly, no matter what you eat.' Worse, in Manhattan there is always someone who leaves before the bill arrives. They'll throw down cash, half of what they owe, and then people like me, who don't drink, end up paying even more. But if I try to use the same trick, the hostess will shout: \\"Where are you going?\\" And it's not like I can say I have somewhere to go: everyone knows I have nowhere to go. But in London, dinner parties are in people's homes. Not only that, the guests are an interesting mix. The last time I went to one, the guests were from France, India, Denmark and Nigeria; it was like a gathering at the United Nations in New York. The mix is less striking.

And I have a brother called Mike. One day, my brother called me and asked me for some advice. He was trying to decide between two job offers: Job 1 - The first job was your typical 40 hour a week \\"office\\" job. Job 2 - The second job was more of a career in the insurance industry , where he would start at the bottom, and after many years and many long hours eventually rise to the top (if he was good). The second job did not pay as well as the first job (at the beginning), but the pay-off of the second job (in the future) was much greater than the first job. So which job should my brother take?

Begin with the End in Mind I asked my brother what was his life's purpose. He said his purpose was to \\"teach,\\" but he wanted to make a lot of money first. I told my brother to forget about the money, and I advised him to focus on his purpose. I then asked him which job best supported his end result of \\"teaching.\\" He said the first job best supported his goal because he would only have to work 40 hours a week, which would give him spare time to teach. He continued on to say, \\"but if I take job number two, I can work hard and make more money, then I can retire early and \\"teach\\" later in life.\\" I again advised him to \\"focus\\" on his purpose, not money.

Article: On the bus, on the subway, every head is lowered to a cell phone, iPad, or other digital device. But does this mean more and more people are getting into reading the digital way? According to the National Reading Survey, before the 17thWorld Reading Day on April 23, only 1.2 percent of Chinese people said they read a lot. But 38.6 percent said they read on digital devices like cell phone and e-books. This is a 17.7 percent increase from 2010. Many experts are talking about a trend toward fragmented reading --reading many short messages or items on a digital device like a cell phone instead of one long text in a book. Zhao jianmin, a professor at Shanghai University, said fragmented reading was part of modern life. \\"The fast _ of life leaves many people no time to sit and read a whole book,\\" he said. \\"So making use of fragmented time to read is sure to be a trend\\" Fragmented reading has its advantages. People can enjoy large amounts of information, knowledge and entertainment in a short time. Digital reading is faster than traditional deep reading. However, some experts fear the trend of digital reading will lead people to read in a simple way. Xu Guosheng, at a Chinese Academy of Press and Publication, says fragmented reading makes it harder for people to think more about what they read. He also warned fragmented reading could make people lazy about remembering facts because they know they can always just search for answers online. \\"Fragmented reading is sometimes good, but don't let it take all your time,\\" suggested Tian Zhilng, an editor. He said it was important to read quality books in a deeper way, and we should read for knowledge, for practical use and for pleasure. He suggested people choose easy books first, then move onto more difficult ones. Question: What is the main idea of the article? Options: A: The results of a national reading survey. B: An explanation of a new trend in reading. C: The advice on how to read the digital way. D: A call to return to traditional deep reading.

Article: Everyone's at it, even my neighbors. I thought I might be the only person left in the world who hadn't done an eBay deal. So I decided to try my hand at online auction. Buying for beginners: Sign up on www.eBay.co.uk. Most items (e.g. tables, computers, and books) ready for auction will come with a picture and a short description; others may be marked with \\"Buy It Now\\" and have a fixed price. You can buy these right away. If the item is being auctioned, you offer the highest price you are prepared to pay and eBay bids for you.The bid will be increased little by little until it goes beyond your highest bid, then you are emailed and asked if you would like to bid again. Auctions last up to 10 days, and when they finish you get an email telling you whether you have won the item. How to pay: Sellers decide how they would like to be paid and you need to check this before placing a bid as you might not want to post a cheque or postal orders. The easiest way is through PayPal, an online payment system that takes the money away from your credit card. Selling made simple: If you plan to sell on eBay, it helps to include a picture of the item.I followed my friends' advice and put up the items I wanted to sell for a 10-day auction, starting on a Thursday.This way buyers had two weekends to bid. The big things in life: It's easy to post a small item, but furniture is a big part of eBay and this has to be collected or sent by delivery men.Check the ways of delivery before you bid.

It could be interpreted in multiple ways, which may elicit either positive, negative, or neutral reactions depending on the reader's perspective. Here are three possible interpretations: 1. Positive sentiment: The tweet could be seen as expressing excitement or praise for bringing a unique feature from San Francisco to Los Angeles, in this case, the iconic fog. The author might be somebody who enjoys or appreciates the foggy weather, and they are excited to see a similar atmosphere in LA. In this interpretation, the sentiment would be positive, and the reader may feel a sense of enjoyment, nostalgia, or satisfaction. 2. Negative sentiment: On the other hand, the tweet could be interpreted as expressing disdain or frustration at the presence of San Francisco-like fog in Los Angeles. LA is known for its consistently sunny weather, and the introduction of fog might be seen as unwelcome to those who enjoy the clear skies and warmth that LA typically offers. In this interpretation, the sentiment would be negative, and the reader may feel a sense of annoyance or disappointment due to the change in weather conditions. 3. Neutral sentiment: Lastly, the tweet could simply be describing the change in weather conditions without any intended emotional statement. The author might be merely observing and documenting the occurrence of fog in LA without expressing any specific emotions such as happiness, excitement, annoyance, or disappointment. In this case, the sentiment would be neutral, and the reader may not have any strong emotional reactions to the tweet. In conclusion, the sentiment of the tweet \\"brought the SF fog to LA\\" is ambiguous and open to interpretation. The context, intentions, and emotions behind the tweet are not clear, and the reader's perception of the sentiment may vary accordingly.

On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.

A regular curriculum includes courses in Arabic, tafsir (Qur'anic interpretation), sharīʻah (Islamic law), hadiths (recorded sayings and deeds of Muhammad), mantiq (logic), and Muslim history. In the Ottoman Empire, during the Early Modern Period, the study of hadiths was introduced by Süleyman I. Depending on the educational demands, some madaris also offer additional advanced courses in Arabic literature, English and other foreign languages, as well as science and world history.

Our protagonist, Tao, a man with a mysterious past known for his uncanny knowledge of rare artifacts, narrowly escapes an attempted ambush by a powerful, sinister organization that believes he holds a priceless artifact capable of unimaginable power. With nearly nothing more than his determination, Tao manages to evade his immediate pursuers, disappearing into the rain-swept forest. However, he understands there's no sure sanctuary for him except to flee the country. Cut to Tao's hasty arrival in a quiet, rural town, where he breaks into a secluded mansion, ignored on the fringes. There, he inadvertently takes three hostages—a tech-savvy teenager, Lisa, her grandfather, Robert, a retired war veteran, and Robert's old flame, Elizabeth, who's visiting them. Their world is turned upside down as this stranger takes over their home. As Tao's pursuers close in, Lisa accidentally finds the artifact hidden in Tao's bag, activating it, and astonishingly revealing Robert's house to be a treasury of untold relics from Robert's former days in covert service. As they realize the value and danger they're in, this unlikely group forms a hesitant alliance born out of necessity. Their pursuers launch an attack on the house leading to intense action sequences and strategic defenses integrating tech and veteran warfare savvy. Meanwhile, the dynamic within their group evolves from a hostage situation to a co-operative mission to safeguard the artifact and their lives. They discover hidden facets of their personalities, and Tao finds himself forming an unexpected bond with the unlikely trio.

With the #1 seed already wrapped up, the Cowboys had little to play for and rested many of their starters in the 2nd half. In the first quarter, Dallas trailed early with Redskins RB Clinton Portis getting a 23-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, Washington increased its lead with kicker Shaun Suisham getting a 46-yard field goal. The Cowboys would respond with rookie kicker Nick Folk getting a 37-yard field goal, but the Redskins replied with Suisham kicking a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Washington continued to lead as Portis got a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Redskins pulled away as QB Todd Collins completed a 42-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss. Dallas would end the game with Folk nailing a 30-yard field goal. With the loss, the Cowboys ended the regular season at 13-3, along with the NFC's #1 seed. The Cowboys secured a bye and home field advantage throughout the playoffs with an NFC best 13-3 regular season record. Fresh off a bye week, the #1 seed Cowboys hosted the #5 seed New York Giants in the Divisional round of the playoffs. The Giants were fresh off an upset win over the #4 seed Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Tampa Bay in the Wild Card round. It would be the third time the NFC East division rivals faced off against each other that season, with the Cowboys winning the previous two matchups. The Giants took the opening kickoff and came out firing, hitting the Cowboys with a quick 52 yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to Amani Toomer. The Cowboys and Giants would exchange punts on the next 2 series before the Cowboy marched 96 yards down the field, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Tony Romo to Terrell Owens (which was reviewed and upheld), tying the score at 7-7. The Cowboys never faced a 3rd down on the drive. With the 2nd quarter underway, the Giants would punt on the next series, giving the ball to the Cowboys at their own 10 yard line with 11:21 left in the 2nd quarter. The Cowboys would proceed to march methodically down the field in small chunks, as they burned up all but 61 seconds of the clock before Marion Barber bulled into the end zone on a 1-yard touchdown run, making it 14-7 in the Cowboys favor (the play was reviewed but upheld). With just 61 seconds left in the half, the Giants seemed to catch the Cowboys' defense napping as they quickly marched down the field from their own 29 yard line, stunning the Cowboys with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Toomer with 11 seconds left in the half. It was Manning and Toomer's 2nd touchdown connection of the first half. The game went into halftime with the score tied at 14-14. The Cowboys took the opening kickoff, and much like their last drive in the first half, proceeded to march very slowly down the field, gaining yards in small chunks. After a drop by tight end Anthony Fasano in the end zone, the Cowboys' long drive stalled out and they had to settle for a 34-yard FG from kicker Nick Folk, to make it 17-14 for the Cowboys. The drive took up over 8 minutes of the 3rd quarter. The next 2 series of the game resulted in punts. After a 25-yard punt return, the Giants had excellent field position at the Dallas 37 yard line. The drive went into the start of the 4th quarter, where Brandon Jacobs rumbled into the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown, to make it 21-17 for the Giants. As the 4th quarter ticked on, both teams exchanged punts on the next 4 series. With 1:50 left in the game, the Cowboys took over on the Giants 48 yard line after a short punt return. They marched down to the Giants 22 yard line with 31 seconds left, still trailing 21-17. On 3rd and 11, with 21 seconds left, Romo lofted a pass into the corner of the end zone that dropped just in front of receiver Patrick Crayton, who had a couple steps on his defender. Replays showed that Crayton hesitated at the top of his route instead of running straight into the end zone, which is where Romo expected him. The pass fell incomplete as a result. Now on 4th down and 11, with just 16 seconds left, Romo heaved a desperation pass into the back of the end zone, into double coverage, which was intercepted by Giants cornerback R.W. McQuarters, effectively ending the game, 21-17 Giants. The 2007 Dallas Cowboy season ended in disappointment, after raising huge hopes with a spectacular 13-3 regular season, the best season for the Cowboys since their last Super Bowl season of 1995. The Giants would go on to shock the undefeated New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.

Most hot water bottles are made with a liquid that can be heated in a microwave. You can also use a more traditional hot water bottle that uses boiled water. Simply boil water on the stove and pour it into the hot water bottle. Place the hot water bottle under your sheets or a blanket, by your feet. It should stay warm all night long, warming your toes and your body. By morning, it will cool to a tepid temperature. Wool is a great material for insulation and retaining warmth. Your feet are often the first body part that starts to feel cold and due to poor circulation, you may have a hard time warming them up with just a blanket. Get several pairs of high wool socks and keep them by your bed. You may reach for them in the night, in the event you can’t get warm. You may also want to invest in house slippers to keep your feet warm throughout the day. Look for thick slippers with rubber soles to keep your feet cozy and give you traction when walking around your home. A good way to stay warm at night is to move closer to your sleeping partner and reap the benefits of natural body heat. If you have a pet, you may consider allowing them to sleep in your bed, if only to keep you warm throughout the night. Drafts are openings between doors, window panes, and sometimes even the slates in your floors, that let cold air into your room. If you keep getting woken up by cold air in your room, check for any drafts by your door, your window panes, or in the corners of your room. Block these drafts with a rolled up blanket or a long pillow. This will help to prevent cool air from circulating in your room as you sleep. You can also hang long blankets over your door and your windows to prevent any cold air from outside from coming in through small cracks into your room. If you continue to wake up at night shivering due to the cold room, try layering your blankets over your sheets, alternating between a thin layer and a thick layer, to create more warmth. Down comforters are great for retaining heat and keeping you warm, as are wool blankets. Down sleeping bags, made for camping, will also keep you very warm throughout the night. Look for them at thrift stores, Goodwill, or camping stores.

However, it does not mention any specific sizes of the record album covers. To answer the question about the sizes of record album covers, it would be helpful to look at the different eras of vinyl records and their corresponding album covers. Generally, the sizes of the covers were designed to accommodate the size of the records they were meant to protect. In the early 20th century, the most common vinyl record sizes were 10-inch and 12-inch discs, which were played at 78 revolutions per minute (RPM). Correspondingly, the album covers at this time would have been designed to fit these records, most likely being slightly larger than the records themselves to ensure protection and easy handling. With the introduction of the 33⅓ RPM 12-inch Long Play (LP) records and 45 RPM 7-inch records in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the sizes of album covers also evolved. The 12-inch LPs quickly became the standard for full-length albums, with their covers measuring around 12.375 inches (31.43 cm) square. The 7-inch 45 RPM records, used mostly for singles, had smaller album covers, measuring around 7.1875 inches (18.26 cm) square. Hence, to accurately answer the question about the sizes of record album covers, one must consider the various formats of vinyl records throughout history and the corresponding sizes of the covers used to store and protect them.

Input: Abstract: Contrary to hindlimb muscle, extracellular calcium plays an important role in diaphragmatic strength generation (J. Appl. Physiol. 58: 2054-61, 1985). Since the inotropic effect of digitalis appears to be related to cell membrane transport of calcium, we studied the effect of digoxin on diaphragmatic contractility in 20 anesthetized dogs. The diaphragm was electrically stimulated with intramuscular electrodes. The transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) during supramaximal (50 V) 2-s stimulations applied over a frequency range of 10-100 Hz was measured with balloon catheters at functional residual capacity. Cardiac output was measured with a Swan-Ganz catheter and diaphragmatic blood flow (Qdi) by timed volume collections of left inferior venous effluent. The force generated by the sartorius muscle during electrical stimulations was studied concomitantly to Pdi. In 10 dogs (group A) 0.04 mg/kg of digoxin was infused in 10 min. In 10 other dogs (group B) 0.2 mg/kg was administered. All measurements were performed during control and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after digoxin administration. In group A, digoxin plasmatic level at 60 min reached a therapeutic range in all dogs (1.8 +/- 0.3 ng/ml), whereas in group B, digoxin plasmatic level was higher (8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml).

A:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"energy.\\" If an atom loses an electron, it forms a positive ion called a cation. Let me provide a detailed explanation: Atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons are positively charged particles, neutrons are neutral particles, and electrons are negatively charged particles. The protons and neutrons are located in an atom's nucleus while electrons orbit around in specific energy levels called electron shells. Due to the opposite charges of protons and electrons, they usually exist in a balanced state in an atom, meaning that the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons, resulting in a neutral overall charge. However, atoms can sometimes lose or gain electrons. When an atom loses an electron, the balance between positive and negative charges is disrupted, as there are now more protons than electrons. The atom becomes a positive ion, specifically called a cation. This process is called ionization. When an atom gains one or more electrons, it becomes negatively charged since there are now more electrons than protons. In this case, the atom is called a negative ion or anion. The term \\"energy\\" in this context does not accurately represent the concept of ion formation. However, it is true that energy plays a role in ion formation. Either energy needs to be supplied or released as a result of an electron being added or removed from an atom. For instance, when energy is supplied to an atom (e.g., through a collision with another particle or exposure to high-energy radiation), an electron can become excited and move to a higher energy level, sometimes even escaping the atom altogether. If the energy provided is enough to overcome the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged protons in the nucleus, the electron can be removed completely, resulting in the formation of a cation. In summary, the correct answer to the question \\"if an atom loses an electron, it forms an ion\\" is not \\"energy,\\" but rather \\"electron.\\" Losing an electron results in the formation of a cation, while gaining an electron leads to the formation of an anion."},{"instruction":"Process: - You inhale - The air enters the mouth and nose - The diaphragm contracts - Air fills all the sacks in the lungs - Oxygen passes through the sacks into capillaries - The blood is passed to the blood in the capillaries - The blood carries the oxygen to the heart - The heart pumps the oxygenated blood to the body. suppose you follow your doctors recommendations more. happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.

The Los Angeles Times reports that he passed away from a heart attack at his home in California on Sunday. For those who may not know, the Addams Family is a popular TV show from the 1960s. It was about a family who was quite different from other families – they liked creepy and spooky things! Ken played the character called Pugsley, who was the son of Gomez and Morticia Addams. Pugsley was a reserved boy who enjoyed eating insects. After high school, Ken joined the Army and served his country. He later decided to try and become an actor in Hollywood. Even though Ken was successful in his role as Pugsley, he did not find much success in acting after the Addams Family TV show. He did appear in a few commercials and an Addams Family movie in 1977 for NBC, but he mostly worked behind the scenes as a grip for Universal Studios. A grip is a person who helps set up for movies and TV shows. They are responsible for handling equipment and making sure everything is in the right place for filming. Grips are an important part of making movies and shows, but they aren't usually the people you see on screen. Now that Ken Weatherwax has passed away, his family is planning to have a funeral for him. They also want to hold a separate event for his fans to remember and celebrate his life.

Roosevelt's \\"fireside chats\\" of the 1930s, mentioning both series' influential nature and their target audience. However, a more detailed and long answer could potentially provide more context and a better understanding of the similarities between the two series of radio talks. A more detailed answer could be: Menzies' \\"The Forgotten People\\" radio talks, delivered from 1942 onward, are often compared to Franklin D. Roosevelt's \\"fireside chats\\" of the 1930s. Both Menzies and Roosevelt used their respective radio talks to address their nations during challenging times and connect with their citizens more intimately. The radio talks provided these leaders with a platform to speak directly to the public about current issues and their vision for the country. Robert Menzies, an Australian Prime Minister, aimed to emphasize the importance of Australia's middle class through his \\"The Forgotten People\\" radio talks, referring to them as the nation's backbone. Menzies felt that the middle class had been overlooked and \\"taken for granted\\" by political parties. His talks sought to bring attention to their needs and champion their values, garnering support for his political agenda in the process. Similarly, Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, utilized his \\"fireside chats\\" to instill confidence in the American people and to gain support for his \\"New Deal\\" policies during the Great Depression. These chats were an attempt to reassure citizens that their president was concerned about their welfare and actively working to improve their lives by communicating directly with them. By comparing Menzies' \\"The Forgotten People\\" radio talks to Roosevelt's \\"fireside chats,\\" it highlights their shared function as a means to engage with the public and humanize political leaders during challenging times. Both series of radio talks served to address citizens' concerns, garnered support for their political agendas, and sought to unify the nation under their leadership. The talks represent two distinct leaders' efforts to directly appeal to their citizens, advocating for a closer relationship between political authorities and the people they serve."},{"instruction":"Produce a detailed sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = Strada, eatType = restaurant, food = Indian, priceRange = high, customer rating = 1 out of 5, familyFriendly = no, near = Rainbow Vegetarian Café Sentence:","output":"The Strada is a restaurant where they serve Indian food, but it's quite expensive and not really good for families with kids, because it got only 1 out of 5 stars from customers, and it's close to another place called Rainbow Vegetarian Café."},{"instruction":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

You could get all existential about your life, but that won't get you anywhere. Instead, put your mind to something and do it. The action of getting something done will show you that you can overcome challenges, and make you feel capable, useful, and worthwhile. It can be anything. Run a 10k. Overcome your shyness. Become a wine connoisseur. Whatever you can see yourself enjoying for a long time will be worth your while. But remember: the harder it is, the bigger the payoff. Losing 5 pounds is great, but losing 10 might make you feel twice as good. This is similar to the previous step. But mastering something, becoming a true expert, will give you a sense of identity, knowledge, and a great feeling of internal satisfaction. Whatever you're good at now, throw yourself into 150%. The payoff will be unimaginable. When you become an expert, you know you're truly good at something. There is no room for doubt, no room for negativity. This can become a haven of positivity, reassurance, and relaxation. And, inevitably, it'll be a part of your everyday life. So if you've been hiding the fact that you play the bagpipes for 8 years now, let 'er out. This is also similar to the last two steps -- in fact, they can all be intertwined. Your resolution could be to become a painter. But back to the point -- creating something is so validating, especially in today's world. We walk through turning on lights with the flick of a switch, talking to people through screens, and sitting down as we scoot down the highway. Everything is done for us. Create something yourself and you become one of the few who are resourceful, knowledgeable, and tuned in. Once more, it doesn't matter what it is.

That's it. That's the feeling. Putting your body to work might get your brain on the right track. It's too easy to get cooped up at the office and consider the 20-foot walk into Starbucks to be your daily gallivant with nature. Go for a walk. Get outside. Feel the sun. You'll wake up, you'll feel more energized, and you'll feel more mentally energized. Old habits may be impossible to erase from your brain, but they aren’t impossible to break. Instead of trying to eradicate old habits, develop healthier, stronger alternatives that bypass the old ones. Developing new habits takes time, but once they are established, they’re with you for life. Do some exercise! Go swimming and try a dive that you have never done before. Go to a dance class and try a style of dance that you don't know. Or try a whole new sport! Volunteer. Working with children, puppies, and the poor are great ways to feel good about yourself.

It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land. - The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name \\"Carboniferous\\" means \\"coal-bearing\\" and derives from the Latin words \\"carb\\" (\\"coal\\") and \\"fer\\" (\\"I bear, I carry\\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian. - Eogyrinus attheyi ( from Greek eos , meaning \`\` dawn '' , and gyrinos , meaning \`\` tadpole '' ) was one of the largest Carboniferous tetrapods , and perhaps one of the largest of its family , Eogyrinidae , at 4.6 metres ( 15 ft ) in length . Eogyrinus appears to have been a powerful swimmer that moved quickly through the water by swishing its long tail from side to side . It may have been a predator , lying in wait for prey in much the same way as a modern crocodile . It was a lightly built animal , weighing around 560 kilograms ( 1,230 lb ) . Although probably better at hunting in the water , Eogyrinus could probably have also made a grab for prey passing close by on land . Fossils of Eogyrinus are known from northern England . Recent studies by Jennifer A. Clack suggest that the amphibian Pholiderpeton described by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869 is the same animal as Eogyrinus . If this is so , then Pholiderpeton 's name takes priority . - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - Eogyrinidae is an extinct family of large, long-bodied tetrapods that lived in the rivers of the Late Carboniferous period. What is the relationship between 'eogyrinus' and 'genus'? A:","output":"Eogyrinus is a species within the Eogyrinidae family, and this family is a group within the superclass Tetrapoda.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose There is lake nearby happens, how will it affect more chemicals are released. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the process of acid rain production - Acid rain is produced by chemicals (such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide) released into the atmosphere, often as a result of human activities like burning fossil fuels. - These chemicals combine with water, oxygen, and other substances to form acidic compounds. - Acid rain falls to the ground and has a range of negative effects on the environment, such as scouring rocks, destroying vegetation, and altering the surrounding environment. Step 2: Consider the perturbation hypothesis - The hypothesis suggests that there is a lake nearby, and more chemicals are being released. - This implies an increase in the emission of acid rain-causing chemicals in the vicinity of the lake. Step 3: Analyze the potential direct effects of the perturbation - The direct effect of this perturbation would likely be an increase in the concentration of acid rain and acidity levels in the area. - Higher acidity levels can result in more severe consequences for the environment and living organisms, including the nearby lake. Step 4: Analyze the potential indirect effects of the perturbation - The indirect effect of this perturbation could be the acceleration of acid rain's negative impacts on the environment. - The destruction of vegetation could happen at a faster rate, and the alteration of the surrounding environment could become more pronounced. - The effects on the lake's water quality and ecosystem could be exacerbated due to increased acidity and other detrimental consequences of acid rain. Conclusion: The supposed perturbation has both direct and indirect effects on the process of acid rain production and its consequences. The increased release of chemicals in the area would lead to higher acidity levels, causing direct harm to the environment, while indirect effects could include accelerated environmental damage and a potentially worsened impact on the nearby lake."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

The need for closure signifies that they want to move forward, come to terms with previous mistakes, and make amends so that they can better support Isabella and ensure her connection with Annalise. 4. \\"guidance\\": This word choice suggests that the speaker is in a difficult situation and recognizes the importance of seeking advice from someone more experienced or knowledgeable. They want to make sure that they handle the situation correctly in order not to let Isabella down and facilitate her relationship with Annalise. 5. \\"strength\\": If the speaker is feeling vulnerable and acknowledges their own weaknesses in the context of the situation, the need for strength would represent a desire to be resilient and persevere through adversity.

Would trail B be shorter or longer than trail A? David is an entomologist. He recently got interested in ants and their behaviors. To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them. Hint: Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to... Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not explicitly mentioned whether trail B would be shorter or longer than trail A. However, we can deduce some information about the trails from the ants' behavior and their use of pheromones. Ants communicate using pheromones and mark trails leading to food sources. When a forager ant discovers a food source, it marks a trail for other ants to follow. This trail is then reinforced by other ants returning with food, making the trail stronger. Once the food source is exhausted, the ants stop marking the trail, and the scent dissipates. When an obstacle blocks an established trail, ants explore new routes to the food source, marking the shortest route they find. In the given case, trail A was followed by many ants, and trail B was abandoned by them. It is possible that trail B was initially established as a path to a food source, but later the food source was either exhausted or blocked by an obstacle. The ants then stopped marking and reinforcing the trail. On the other hand, trail A might still have a viable food source, explaining the preference of ants for this trail. The ants' behavior of marking the shortest route back to the colony when they find a new path after encountering an obstacle could suggest that trail A is shorter than trail B. However, this is not definitive, as the situation might be more complex. To summarize, it is not explicitly mentioned whether trail B is shorter or longer than trail A, but based on the ants' behavior and their use of pheromones, it could be inferred that trail A might be shorter or more efficient in terms of reaching a viable food source. However, without more context and details, we cannot provide a definitive answer."},{"instruction":"What is a shorter version of this: israel has ordered the confiscation of a swathe of palestinian land to build a barrier around its largest settlement in the west bank , israeli and palestinian sources said wednesday .

Movie title: Eden Log Movie plot: A man wakes up disoriented, deep inside an underground cave. Suffering amnesia, he has no recollection of who he is, or how he got there. A dead man lies next to him. As he stumbles around in the limited light, he comes upon a dilapidated area with damaged pieces of technology all around him. A registration plays, explaining the place is a sort of processing network called Eden Log, whose workers are all immigrants promised citizenship in the society above ground. The workers are apparently harvesting the sap of a gigantic plant whose roots and vines are now everywhere in the underground complex, which appears abandoned. While trying to reach the surface, the man comes upon a bearded stranger pinned against the wall by the protruding vines that are slowly taking over his body. The stranger, in great pain and sounding deranged, tells the man he's the creator of that entire system, and then warns him about an unseen menace. A growling noise approaches and the man loses consciousness. Upon waking up, the man keeps going up, passing throughout areas increasingly better-lit. He retrieves more recordings, revealing that one of the network technicians refused to give access to security personnel. It becomes clear that some kind of revolt was started by the workers over the conditions in the network. As a result, the corporate overlords ordered the security forces to forcibly take control of the network levels and seal the area. The man climbs up to Level -3, where he overhears some security personnel talk about their orders to capture \\"the architect\\". They also have what looks like a mutated human chained up, and it's revealed that a significant amount of the worker population have changed into mutants. On Level -2, the man ends up in a small laboratory, which is suddenly surrounded by mutants.

Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work. The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

Aging actress Arlene Iverson (Janet Ward) hires Harry to find her 16-year-old daughter Delly Grastner (Melanie Griffith). Arlene's only source of income is her daughter's trust-fund, but it requires Delly to be living with her. Arlene gives Harry the name of one of Delly's friends in L.A., a mechanic called Quentin (James Woods). Quentin tells Harry that he last saw Delly at a New Mexico film location, where she started flirting with one of Arlene's old flames, stuntman Marv Ellman (Anthony Costello). Harry realises that the injuries to Quentin's face are from fighting the stuntman and sympathises with his bitterness towards Delly. He travels to the film location and talks to Marv and stunt coordinator, Joey Ziegler (Edward Binns). Before returning to L.A., Harry is surprised to see Quentin working on Marv's stunt plane. Harry suspects that Delly may be trying to seduce her mother's ex-lovers and travels to the Florida Keys, where her stepfather Tom Iverson (John Crawford) lives.

Hobbies can include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. A list of hobbies is lengthy and always changing as interests and fashions change. By continually participating in a particular hobby, one can acquire substantial skill and knowledge in that area. Engagement in hobbies has increased since the late nineteenth century as workers have more leisure time and advancing production and technology have provided more support for leisure activities.

It has been one of the world's most popular hobbies since the late nineteenth century with the rapid growth of the postal service, but is now in decline with the rise of the internet which has sharply reduced the number of postal items arriving in households. Stamp collecting proved to be an almost perfect hobby for collectors because there was a never ending stream of new stamps as each country sought to advertise its distinctiveness through its stamps.

He ended up in the solar system in search of water. He identified three planets, planet A, planet B and planet C. Little did he know that less than a hundred years ago people used to call planet A as Earth, planet B as Venus, and planet C as Mercury. Which planet would have lower pressure on the surface, planet A or planet B? Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","output":"In the year 2200, David the astronaut finds himself in the solar system, attempting to discern between planets A, B, and C in terms of surface pressure. As per the information provided and the hints given, we can determine that planet A is Earth, planet B is Venus, and planet C is Mercury. On Earth (planet A), the pressure at sea level is typically 101.325 kPa (kiloPascals), which is considered standard atmospheric pressure. Earth's atmosphere composition comprises primarily nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace amounts of other gases such as argon and carbon dioxide. Conversely, Venus (planet B) has an atmosphere that is much denser, with a composition mainly of carbon dioxide (about 96%) and a small amount of nitrogen (3.5%). The clouds of Venus are composed of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and significant amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid. The surface pressure on Venus is approximately 90 times greater than Earth's, translating to roughly 9.2 MPa (MegaPascals). Taking into account the given information, we can deduce that planet A (Earth) would have significantly lower pressure on its surface compared to planet B (Venus). Earth's atmosphere—comprised substantially of nitrogen and oxygen, with water vapor clouds—results in surface pressure that is much more moderate compared to Venus's heavily dense atmosphere and more oppressive surface pressure."},{"instruction":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: where do you find iodine Suggested answer: A number of iodine radioisotopes are also used in medical applications.

It is a lively comedy, remarkably requiring 14 singers six men and eight women. The libretto had first been offered in 1871 to Offenbach; the title also went through various permutations (\\"Le Talon rouge\\", \\"Si le Roi le savait\\", \\"Le Roi le sait\\") before settling on its final name.

He was a very important person who helped people when there were fires or other accidents. He made sure everyone was safe and led a team of helpers called firefighters. Everyone in Louisiana knew the Fire Chief because he was so helpful and kind. One day, a lot of rain fell in Louisiana, causing floods. Floods are when there's too much water, and it goes into houses and roads, making it hard for people to go anywhere. Many things can get destroyed and people need help to clean up and fix their houses. So, some kind and brave people decided to become flood relief workers. Their job was to help those who were affected by the floods and make them feel better. These flood relief workers had to travel from one place to another to help people. They went on a big vehicle called a bus, which can carry many people safely. The Fire Chief also went with them because he wanted to help as many people as possible. But sadly, something very sad happened while they were on their way to help others. The bus had an accident. When accidents happen, it means that something is not working the way it should, and people can get hurt. In this accident, the bus carrying the flood relief workers and the Fire Chief crashed. A crash is when the bus hits something really hard and stops moving suddenly. When crashes happen, people can get hurt very badly. Unfortunately, the crash was very bad, and two persons, including the Fire Chief, died. To die means that someone's body stops working, and they can't come back to life. We lose them forever, and it makes everyone very sad. When something sad like this happens, all the people in Louisiana come together to support each other and remember the good things that these people did for others. Everyone knows that the Fire Chief was a very kind and helpful person, and they will always remember him in their hearts. It's important to remember that when bad things happen, it's okay to be sad, but we should also remember to be grateful for the good times and good people who help others."},{"instruction":"Q:Answer the following question given this paragraph: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things.

In the film industry, the writer develops the story, characters, and dialogue for the movie, while the director is responsible for overseeing the entire film production process, from pre-production and casting to post-production and final editing. The director ensures that the film adheres to the creative vision and collaborates with various departments, such as the actors, cinematographers, and production designers, to bring the story to life on screen. When one person assumes both the writer and director roles, it often provides a closer alignment of the creative vision, as the same individual who crafted the story also supervises its translation into a movie. David M. Evans, as both co-writer and director of The Sandlot, was able to maintain consistency and authenticity in the film's portrayal of the story. Having a clear understanding of the characters and narrative from the writing stage enabled him to make informed decisions during filming, resulting in a cohesive final product.

The premise seems to suggest that there is a common problem that occurs in different systems, including those where kings and monarchs hold power. In this context, it can be inferred that the author is referring to the issues existing in these governance systems, thus relating to the hypothesis. However, the premise is quite vague and lacks a specific mention of what \\"the same problem\\" refers to. To establish a clear connection between the premise and the hypothesis, more information is needed about the nature of the problem in question. In a broader context, it can be argued that all forms of governance, whether democracies, monarchies, or any other systems, have their unique challenges and problems. Nevertheless, some issues can be common across these systems. For instance, corruption, power struggles, and socio-economic inequalities can be present in both democratic and monarchical societies. In summary, while the given hypothesis could be entailed by the premise, it would be more accurate to say that the hypothesis is partially entailed by the premise due to the vagueness of the original statement. A clearer definition of the problem under discussion would be necessary to establish a more direct relationship between the premise and the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Translate to French: Involve your Human Resources professionals in order to develop these plans.","output":"To translate the English phrase \\"Involve your Human Resources professionals in order to develop these plans.\\" into French, one could take the following steps: Step 1: Recognize the individual words.

This economic issue has arisen as a wake-up call for the nation, urging policymakers and citizens to address structural and budgetary challenges in order to ensure long-term prosperity. The current account deficit, which represents a gap between the value of goods and services a country exports and the value of goods and services it imports, has dramatically widened in recent months. This deficit, coupled with a range of other economic indicators, highlights Australia's vulnerability and the urgent need for strong economic policy reforms. According to the Treasurer, one of the primary contributors to the current account deficit is a decline in export earnings, caused in part by the global economic slowdown and lower demand for Australian commodities. Additionally, Australia has been grappling with persistent trade deficits, diminishing investments, and lower productivity levels – all factors that have placed increased pressure on the nation's current account balance. Moreover, Australia's current account deficit has resulted in an increased reliance on foreign capital. This has the potential to compromise the country's financial stability, should global financial markets undergo a downturn or if investors lose confidence in Australia's economy. As a result, the Treasurer is urging the government to address these issues through strategic planning and policy implementation. Several steps have been proposed to tackle the current account deficit and associated economic challenges: 1. Boosting productivity – There is a pressing need to improve national productivity through investments in infrastructure, education, and skills development. By increasing productivity, Australia can strengthen its competitiveness in global markets and bolster export revenues. 2. Encouraging innovation – Supporting research and development in key sectors such as technology, agriculture, and energy can help Australia diversify its economy and reduce dependence on the commodities market. 3. Enhancing fiscal responsibility – The government should prioritize more efficient spending, reducing the budget deficit, and managing public debt to create a sound financial environment. 4. Focusing on domestic demand – Policymakers should take measures to encourage private sector investment and consumer spending, fostering sustainable economic growth that is less reliant on external factors. 5. Nurturing sustainable relationships – The government should pursue trade agreements and partnerships that create opportunities for economic cooperation and mutual growth with other countries. The Treasurer's remarks on the current account deficit reveal a sense of urgency within the Australian government to address these long-standing economic issues that have accumulated over time. By implementing policy changes and strategic initiatives that address productivity, innovation, fiscal responsibility, domestic demand, and international relationships, Australia can work towards rebalancing its current account and fostering an economy built on stable growth and prosperity. In conclusion, the Australian Treasurer's recent statement on the current account deficit serves as a wake-up call to the nation. The current economic situation is a warning signal that highlights the need for decisive action and a reevaluation of Australia's economic trajectory. It is essential that the government, policymakers, and citizens come together to address the challenges posed by the current account deficit and ensure a brighter economic future for Australia."},{"instruction":"On Veterans Day, former Army special ops officer Gary Linfoot took a brisk stroll around the Statue of Liberty. That's remarkable because Linfoot is a paraplegic -- injured while on one of his many tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. He's been wheelchair-bound and paralyzed below the waist since 2008. But new technology has offered Linfoot the opportunity to walk again. The bionic suit. It's possible because of a kind of wearable robot -- a full-body apparatus developed by California-based Ekso Bionics. Built-in sensors detect the user's weight shifts and initiate steps. Battery-powered motors drive the legs and make up for deficits in neuromuscular function. Linfoot is the first veteran to receive the Ekso suit for personal use. It's a gift made possible through a nonprofit organization focused on mental and physical issues facing returning veterans and their families. \\"We were able to surprise the heck out a great soldier of ours. He's now marching around,\\" said Colin Baden, president of Infinite Hero Foundation. The symbolic walk signals Linfoot's determination to move on -- and the backdrop of the Statue of Liberty National Monument represents \\"the freedom I fought for,\\" said Linfoot. Special veterans court marks 25th anniversary. One soldier's strength. A highly decorated soldier, Linfoot was a member of the U.S. Army's elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne). During his 19th combat tour in Iraq, his helicopter had a mechanical failure and crashed. After just three months of rehabilitation, Linfoot returned to duty as the officer in charge of the Special Operations Aquatic Training Facility. Since retiring from service in 2010, he has pushed hard to overcome limitations. Linfoot now lives with his wife, Mari, in Clarksville, Tennessee. He will provide crucial information to advance the technology of the bionic suit. It's in limited, trial use at hospitals and rehabilitation centers for patients with spinal cord injuries or those who've suffered strokes. Fast-moving technology. Creators of the Ekso suit predict the kind of rapid availability seen with other technology in recent years. \\"We definitely see opportunity to reduce the cost (currently about 100,000). When you look back in time, only a few people could afford the first cell phones. Now, the masses can enjoy that technology,\\" said Ekso Bionics co-founder Russ Angold. The idea was originally funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the U.S. Department of Defense agency that has a history of world-changing innovations. Today, many entities are working to broaden applications of the wearable robot. A team of engineers and medical doctors at Georgia Tech Research Institute is working to enhance sensors in the suit that would make mobility possible even in difficult terrain. \\"Technology is developing not only to help people walk again, but to help retrain neural pathways and mend the ruptured spinal column so that it can regenerate,\\" said GTRI Health Systems Technical Director Dr. Shean Phelps, a former special forces officer. Veterans find a new way to serve -- in the kitchen. The scope of paralysis. In this country, some 6 million people -- one in 50 -- live with some degree of paralysis, according to a 2009 report by the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation. Actor Christopher Reeve, who was outspoken about his resolve to walk again after a paralyzing accident, died in 2004. At that time, the concept of the robotic exoskeleton was still in its infancy. \\"It was science fiction technology. That is what we were working on,\\" said Angold. \\"Here we are less than 10 years later, and we're helping people walk again that otherwise couldn't. And so we've brought science fiction to reality in a very short period of time.\\" Just five people in the world own Ekso suits. One of the pioneers is endurance athlete Mark Pollack. Though blind and paralyzed, he recently set a record -- walking the equivalent of a mile and a half in a one-hour training session. Symbolic steps. On this day, a crisp, clear afternoon in November, Gary Linfoot stands his full 6 feet, 2 inches tall and walks again. The site is significant on many levels. The Statue of Liberty is a universal beacon of freedom and part of the National Parks Service, which offers free, year-round access to all national parks for disabled veterans. \\"Being here on Veterans Day with New York City in the background -- it's very special,\\" says Linfoot. \\"It exemplifies hope for the future. One day, one day soon, we'll be able to leave that wheelchair behind.\\" Members of Congress thank veterans on Twitter. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. On Veterans Day, former U.S. Army officer Gary Linfoot, paralyzed from waist down since 2008 after being injured in duty, was able to walk around the Statue of Liberty due to a bionic suit developed by Ekso Bionics. 2. This wearable robotic apparatus with built-in sensors responds to user's weight shifts to initiate steps and uses battery-powered motors to drive the legs, compensating for deficits in neuromuscular function. 3. Linfoot is the first veteran to receive the Ekso suit for personal use, a gift facilitated by the Infinite Hero Foundation, a nonprofit aimed at addressing mental and physical issues faced by returning veterans and their families. 4. The Ekso Bionics suit is presently in limited, trial use at hospitals and rehabilitation centers for patients with spinal cord injuries or who've suffered strokes. 5. The creators of the Ekso suit predict a future decline in its current cost (around 100,000), bringing it to a wider user base much like other technologies have experienced in recent years. 6. A team at the Georgia Tech Research Institute is working on improving the suit's sensors to enable mobility even in difficult terrains. 7. Around 6 million people, one in 50, live with some degree of paralysis in the country, based on a 2009 report by the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation. 8. Currently, only five people in the world own Ekso suits - one of them is endurance athlete Mark Pollack who, despite being blind and paralyzed, walked the equivalent of a mile and a half in a one-hour training session. 9. The Statue of Liberty stroll was significant as the monument represents \\"the freedom I fought for,\\" said Linfoot, expressing hope about leaving the wheelchair behind in near future."},{"instruction":"The Broncos traveled to Arrowhead Stadium for an AFC West rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs.

Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for Shrek to appear to save his life.

It won the MTV Movie Spoof Award at the MTV Movie Awards 2007. The short was created by Andy Signore along with some of his friends. During his speech, he said, roughly, \\"The film was not making fun of a tragedy; it was a tribute to those who stood up against tyranny\\". Can we infer the following? United 300 was banned from some schools","output":"Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly stated that United 300 was banned from some schools. The film is a parody of two popular movies, \\"United 93\\" and \\"300\\", and was created by Andy Signore along with his friends. The film won the MTV Movie Spoof Award at the MTV Movie Awards in 2007, which signifies its recognition and appreciation within the entertainment industry. However, this does not necessarily imply that the film faced any ban or restrictions, particularly in schools. According to Signore's statement during his speech, the short film was intended as a tribute to those who stood up against tyranny, rather than making fun of a tragedy. This suggests that the creators of the parody were mindful of the potential sensitivity around the themes of the films being spoofed, especially \\"United 93\\", which is based on the real-life events of the September 11, 2001 attacks. It is possible that some schools might have disapproved of the film due to its subject matter or the nature of parody, especially if they have concerns related to the way the film handles real-life tragedies or the historical events depicted in the movies it parodies. However, without further information specifically indicating that United 300 was banned from some schools, it would be speculative to make that inference. In conclusion, while it is not possible to definitively state whether or not United 300 was banned from some schools based on the provided information, it is essential to recognize that the creators of the parody intended it as a tribute and not as a way of making fun of tragic events.

Unfortunately, there isn't a well-known artist by that name in public records or renowned art circles. However, it is plausible that Bronwyn Joy Gooda could have been a local or lesser-known artist whose life and work primarily took place in Australia. In a country famous for its love for art, it is not uncommon to find talented individuals who engage in various forms of artistic expression, including sculpture. Sculpture, as an artistic medium, has a long tradition of being an integral part of Australian culture. This field is known for producing world-renowned artists such as Ron Mueck, Deborah Halpern, and Ricky Swallow, among others. Considering the timeframe of her life, it is possible that Bronwyn Joy Gooda's work may have been influenced by popular sculptural movements and styles of her time. These could include Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, or Postmodernism. It is also likely that she could have been influenced and inspired by fellow Australian artists, incorporating distinct elements and themes related to her cultural background, such as Aboriginal art and symbolism, as well as the Australian landscape. Her sculptures may have been exhibited in local galleries or events, providing a platform for Bronwyn to share her work with her community or perhaps even nationally. Although not much information is available about her artistic career, her art may very well have left an impact on those who encountered it. It is important to remember that the significance of an artist's work cannot always be measured by their fame or public recognition alone. In conclusion, while we cannot accurately confirm that the details provided refer to a specific, well-known Australian artist, it is quite plausible that these details refer to Bronwyn Joy Gooda, who might have been a talented and passionate artist in her own right. Her contributions to the world of sculpture, even if known to a limited audience, should be remembered and acknowledged."},{"instruction":"Title: Perfect!

Article: A 15-year-old Saanich student who invented a flashlight powered by body heat is heading home today from California with a big prize--and an opportunity to expand on her work. St. Michaels University School student Ann Makosinski was the only Canadian among the four winners at Google's annual international science fair, beating out thousands of other young scientists from around the world. Winning the international contest was \\"a total shock\\", Ann said from San Francisco. \\"I definitely think it will have an influence on my future.\\" Ann thanked her family for encouraging her interest in science, telling the judges that her first toy was a box of transistors . Ann's prize includes a 25,000 scholarship and a \\"once-in-a-lifetime experience\\" from either the European Organization for Nuclear Research, Lego or Google for her Hollow Flashlight, which has no moving parts or batteries. Ann created the flashlight for a local science fair. The inspiration for the invention came from seeing unwanted batteries and after visits to the Philippines, where she saw the need for a battery-free flashlight. A friend at school there failed in her studies because of a lack of electricity and light to study when it became dark. In her project, Ann wrote that she \\"made two flashlights that do not use any batteries, harmful chemicals, or kinetic energy . They do not create any noise and will always work. The flashlight's only limitation is its need for at least a 5degC temperature difference to provide usable light.\\" A You Tube video of Ann explaining how she created the flashlight has been viewed more than 1.4 million times. Despite her success, the private school student is undecided about her career path. Ann hopes she can find a way to combine her love of film with science. The four winners were chosen from 15 finalists from eight countries. The contest attracted thousands of entries from students in 120 countries. Question: What do we know about Ann Makosinski? - She is studying at a public school. - She dreams of becoming a scientist. - Her success is partly due to her family. - She was sure she would win the contest. Answer:","output":"From the information provided in the article, we know that Ann Makosinski is a 15-year-old student at St. Michaels University School, a private institution, not a public school.

They then use the ATP and NADPH to make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process known as the Calvin cycle. Chloroplasts carry out a number of other functions, including fatty acid synthesis, much amino acid synthesis, and the immune response in plants. The number of chloroplasts per cell varies from one, in unicellular algae, up to 100 in plants like Arabidopsis and wheat. Question: Based on this passage, what does a chloroplast do in a plant cell? Let's give stream of consciousness first:","output":"A chloroplast in a plant cell primarily conducts photosynthesis, a process in which the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll captures energy from sunlight. During this process, chloroplasts convert and store the captured energy in energy-storage molecules ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), while also releasing oxygen from water. Following this, chloroplasts utilize the ATP and NADPH produced to create organic molecules from carbon dioxide through a process called the Calvin cycle. Besides these primary functions, chloroplasts also participate in other essential cellular activities. These include synthesizing fatty acids and a majority of amino acids, as well as contributing to the immune response in plants.

Their estimate in the BMJ comes from studying more than 32,000 samples of human tissue removed during appendix operations carried out between 2000 and 2012 at 41 hospitals. It remains unclear if any of these carriers will ever develop symptoms. Early predictions of a vCJD epidemic didn't come to fruition. To date, here have been 177 UK deaths from vCJD. Most of these occurred in the late 90s and early 2000s. There has been only one death in the last two years. The rare, fatal disease progressively attacks the brain. But it appears that relatively few who catch the infectious agent that causes the disease develop symptoms. People can be \\"silent\\" carriers for decades and not even know it. The BMJ research identified 16 such carriers out of the thousands of appendix tissue samples studied. Experts say many vital questions remain unanswered. Since the link between vCJD and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), known as mad cow disease, was discovered in 1996, there have been strict controls to prevent meat from infected cattle from entering the food chain. However, the average time it takes for the symptoms of vCJD to occur after initial infection is still unclear. Preventing spread This means people exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced continue to develop variant CJD, and may spread it to others. Experience tells us that the disease could be transmitted from human to human via blood - in the UK, there have been three reported cases of vCJD associated with a blood transfusion. Blood donor services take measures to ensure blood is not infected but there is no test to screen for vCJD, although scientists are working on this. And there is currently no cure for the disease. Prof Sebastian Brandner of University College London, who led the BMJ research, said: \\"We do not know what will happen. \\"Will these people develop disease and can they transmit it? There are many questions we still do not know the answers to.\\" Prof Richard Knight, director of the National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, said the answers might not be known for decades. In the meantime, surveillance was key, he said. \\"You can see from the data available that its likely that we will get a secondary or tertiary wave of disease but its likely that these further waves will be small. \\"Future clinical cases will be pretty small in number,\\" he added. Dr Graham Jackson, of the MRC Prion Unit at UCL Institute of Neurology, said: \\"Given the high levels of infection indicated by this research, it is now crucial we establish how many people in the UK harbour that infection in their bloodstream in order to adequately assess the risks of transmission through contaminated blood donations. \\"Studies to develop new blood tests for CJD must remain a priority to assist with screening and protecting the UK blood supply.\\"","output":"Researchers have found that one in every 2,000 people in the UK could be carriers of the disease linked to eating contaminated beef.

Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985. - The Apple II Plus (stylized as Apple ][+) is the second model of the Apple II series of personal computers produced by Apple Computer, Inc. It was sold from June 1979 to December 1982. - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense). - Wizard and the Princess ( 1980 ) , also known as Adventure in Serenia ( 1982 ) , is a 1980s computer game by On - Line Systems for the Apple II , Apple II Plus , and Commodore 64 . It is the second title released in On - Line Systems ' Hi - Res Adventure series after Mystery House . It is a prelude to the King 's Quest series in both story and concept ( though chronologically set several years before King 's Quest V ) . It 's the first adventure game released with full color graphics . - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time. - Mystery House is an adventure game released by On-Line Systems in .

Georgette Heyer (; 16 August 1902 - 4 July 1974) was an English historical romance and detective fiction novelist. Her writing career began in 1921, when she turned a story for her younger brother into the novel The Black Moth. While holidaying with her family in December 1920, Heyer met George Ronald Rougier, who was two years her senior. The two became regular dance partners while Rougier studied at the Royal School of Mines to become a mining engineer. In the spring of 1925, shortly after the publication of her fifth novel, they became engaged. One month later, Heyer's father died of a heart attack. He left no pension, and Heyer assumed financial responsibility for her brothers, aged 19 and 14. Two months after her father's death, on 18 August, Heyer and Rougier married in a simple ceremony. In October 1925 Rougier was sent to work in the Caucasus Mountains, partly because he had learned Russian as a child. Heyer remained at home and continued to write. In 1926, she released These Old Shades, in which the Duke of Avon courts his own ward. Unlike her first novel, These Old Shades focused more on personal relationships than on adventure. The book appeared in the midst of the 1926 United Kingdom general strike; as a result, the novel received no newspaper coverage, reviews, or advertising. Nevertheless, the book sold 190,000 copies. Because the lack of publicity had not harmed the novel's sales, Heyer refused for the rest of her life to promote her books, even though her publishers often asked her to give interviews. She once wrote to a friend that \\"as for being photographed at Work or in my Old World Garden, that is the type of publicity which I find nauseating and quite unnecessary. My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.\\" Rougier returned home in the summer of 1926, but within months he was sent to the East African territory of Tanganyika. Heyer joined him there the following year. They lived in a hut made of elephant grass located in the bush; Heyer was the first white woman her servants had ever seen. While in Tanganyika, Heyer wrote The Masqueraders; set in 1745, the book follows the romantic adventures of siblings who pretend to be of the opposite sex in order to protect their family, all former Jacobites. Although Heyer did not have access to all of her reference material, the book contained only one anachronism: she placed the opening of White's a year too early. She also wrote an account of her adventures, titled \\"The Horned Beast of Africa\\", which was published in 1929 in the newspaper The Sphere. In 1928, Heyer followed her husband to Macedonia, where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic. She insisted they return to England before starting a family. The following year Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner. After a failed experiment running a gas, coke, and lighting company, Rougier purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money they borrowed from Heyer's aunts. Heyer's brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier, while Heyer continued to provide the bulk of the family's earnings with her writing.

A:","output":"Based on the provided biography, several details about Elisenda De Montcada can be established about her life, personal relationships, social status, and her contributions. 1. Personal Information: Elisenda De Montcada was born approximately in the year 1292 and died on 19th June 1364. As such, she would have lived during the late Middle Ages, a period marked by significant changes in society, the economy, and culture. She was a daughter of Pere De Montcada and his wife Elisenda De Pinos. 2. Heritage: Elisenda's genealogy is slightly complicated. Her great-grandmother, Constance, Lady of Aitona, was an illegitimate daughter of Peter II of Aragon. This makes her and her husband James II of Aragon second cousins once removed. So, she has a direct connection to royal blood through her great-grandmother. 3. Marital Status and Family: In her personal life, Elisenda was the fourth and last wife of James II of Aragon, who was thirty years her senior. Upon her marriage, she assumed the role of stepmother to James's ten children from his previous marriage to Blanche of Naples. Despite their five-year marriage, Elisenda and James did not have any children of their own. 4. Queen Consort of Aragon: Elisenda's marriage made her the Queen Consort of Aragon. As Queen Consort, she likely had a significant role to play in the royal court, even though specific details about her reign are not provided in this biography. 5. Religion and Patronage: Elisenda and James founded the Monastery of Pedralbes in 1326. After her husband’s death a year later, Elisenda retired to the monastery palace immediately. Even though she never took vows to become a nun, she used her royal influence and wide powers over the internal workings of the monastery. 6. Death and Burial: Elisenda stayed at the monastery for the rest of her life and died in 1364. Notably, her tomb serves as a significant piece of Catalan Gothic art. It depicts Elisenda dressed as a penitent along the cloister, demonstrating a continued devotion to her religion and monastic life. This suggests that even in death, she maintained a strong connection to the monastery she helped found. Considering all these details, the biography paints a picture of a woman of noble birth who ascends to a royal status through marriage, engages in religious patronage, and retreats to a closely held religious devotion following her husband's death. It also shows that despite her royal position, she chose a life of humility and religious devotion after she was widowed."},{"instruction":"remy worked hard for the skateboarding competition and received carson's reward.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"In order to determine the most sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning for finishing touches on a small hand thrown pottery bowl, it is essential to first understand the whole process and the plausible steps that can be taken towards the end of the making process. Hand thrown pottery involves the following steps: 1. Preparation of clay 2. Wedging the clay 3. Centering on the potter's wheel 4. Opening the clay 5. Pulling up the walls 6. Shaping the bowl 7. Trimming 8. Drying and bisque firing 9. Glazing 10. Final firing Now, focusing on the finishing touches of a small hand thrown pottery bowl, here are several key steps that involve naive physics reasoning: a. Trimming: After the pottery bowl has stiffened slightly, place it back on the wheel in an upside-down position. Secure it with lumps of clay or a pottery gripping tool called Giffin Grip. With a trimming tool, carve and shape the bottom of the bowl, creating a foot or base, carefully considering the balance and proportions of the final piece. It requires an understanding of the clay's consistency and tension forces to avoid cutting through it too much. b. Smoothing and detailing: After trimming, use a soft sponge, rubber rib, or chamois cloth to smooth out any rough edges or imperfections. Add details such as carving or slip trailing as desired, considering the likely forces exerted by the tools on the clay. c. Drying: Allow the bowl to dry slowly and evenly to prevent it from cracking due to uneven shrinkage forces. Keep it away from direct sunlight, drafts, and turn it periodically to ensure even drying. d. Bisque firing: The dried pottery bowl is fired in a kiln at a relatively low temperature, typically around 1800°F (980°C). This process hardens the clay, making the bowl robust enough for glazing, while also ensuring it remains porous. The heat flow in the kiln and the thermal expansion forces are considered to avoid cracks and deformations. e. Glazing: Once the bisque-fired bowl has cooled, apply glaze to its surfaces using brushes, pouring, or dipping methods. You must consider how the glaze will interact with the clay body and be mindful of its consistency, surface tension, and the forces exerted by gravity that cause the glaze to flow and settle on the pot. f. Final firing: The glazed bowl is fired again at a higher temperature, typically between 2200°F (1200°C) and 2400°F (1300°C) for stoneware or porcelain. This process matures the glaze, causing it to melt and form a glass-like surface. The balance between heat flow, the right temperature, and time is vital to prevent the bowl from warping, cracking, or having an undesirable finish. To answer which of these steps involve more sound naive physics reasoning, it can be said that trimming (a) and glazing (e) are the most sound in terms of naive physics reasoning, as these steps directly correspond to the finishing touches and ask the potter to balance forces, consistency, surface tension, and overall structure. Trimming includes understanding and controlling the forces exerted by the tool on the clay, while glazing demands managing the coating's consistency, surface tension, and the final appearance after firing. Both of these steps significantly contribute to the final look, stability, and quality of the small hand thrown pottery bowl."},{"instruction":"Do you feel a little sleepy after lunch?

Answer the above question based on the context below: During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here. Brzezinski further stated: The fact that the Soviet government has enabled me to be here—and the Soviets know my views—is symbolic of the breach with Stalinism that perestroika represents.

Associated Press Reporter. A federal judge in Kentucky struck down the state's ban on gay marriage on Tuesday, saying that it violated equality laws. Despite the ban being overturned, the ruling was temporarily put on hold, and it was not immediately clear when same-sex couples could be issued marriage licenses. U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn in Louisville concluded that the state's prohibition on same-sex couples being wed violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution by treating gay couples differently than straight couples. Campaign: Protesters for and against gay marriage gather at a rally, above. A Kentucky judge ruled on Tuesday that that state's ban on same-sex marriage violated equality laws. Heyburn previously struck down Kentucky's. ban on recognizing same-sex marriages from other states and countries,. but he put the implementation of that ruling on hold. That decision did not deal with whether Kentucky would have to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Instead, Tuesday's ruling dealt directly with that question. 'Sometimes, by upholding equal rights for a few, courts necessarily must require others to forebear some prior conduct or restrain some personal instinct,' Heyburn wrote. 'Here, that would not seem to be the case. Assuring equal protection for same-sex couples does not diminish the freedom of others to any degree.' Heyburn noted that every federal court to consider a same-sex marriage ban has found it unconstitutional. Uncertain future: A couple embrace at a Defense of Marriage Act rally last June.

Plot title: John Carpenter's The Fog Movie plot: Set in a Northern California fishing town called Antonio Bay, the town is about to celebrate its centennial on April 21, 1980, and are having a celebration led by Kathy Williams (Janet Leigh). However, the centennial is also marked by ominous events, including the appearance of a glowing fog that spreads over land and sea.In the first scene, on the night before the town's celebration, a group of children seated around a campfire on a beach, are entertained by a ghost story, told by 'old' Mr. Machen (John Houseman) (exactly at the stroke of midnight), the resident elderly fisherman. The story being told is indicative of the history of the town's formation, which is being discovered at that exact moment by the local priest, Father Malone (Hal Holbrook), when he finds the diary of his grandfather (who was also the town's priest).The diary later reveals a dark secret unknown to the current inhabitants where, in 1880, six of the founders of Antonio Bay (including Malone's grandfather) deliberately sank and plundered the Elizabeth Dane, a clipper ship owned by Blake, a wealthy man with leprosy who wanted to establish a colony near Antonio Bay. The six conspirators lit a fire on the beach near treacherous rocks, and the crew of the clipper, deceived by the false beacon, crashed into them. Everyone aboard the ship perished. The six conspirators were motivated both by greed and disgust at the notion of having a leper colony nearby. Antonio Bay and its church were then founded with the gold plundered from the ship.The mysterious fog contains the vengeful ghosts of Blake and the clipper's crew, who have come back on the 100th anniversary of the shipwreck and the founding of the town to apparently take the lives of six people (symbolic substitutes for the six conspirators).This same night, three local fishermen, Al Williams, Tommy Wallace, and Dick Baxter, are gruesomely murdered by supernatural attackers after the fog covers their boat.

Answer:","output":"In the movie John Carpenter's The Fog, the character Dan O'Bannon (played by Charles Cyphers) is killed by the vengeful ghosts of Blake and the crew of the Elizabeth Dane. These ghosts are within the mysterious, glowing fog that spreads throughout the town of Antonio Bay during its centennial on April 21, 1980. The ghosts have returned to seek revenge on the town as they were wronged 100 years earlier when the six founders of Antonio Bay deliberately sank and plundered their ship, the Elizabeth Dane. The town and its church were built using the gold taken from the ship, which originally belonged to Blake, a wealthy leper who wanted to establish a colony near Antonio Bay. As Dan becomes one of the six victims the vengeful ghosts claim to represent the six conspirators involved in the town's dark past, he meets his demise at the hands of the supernatural attackers concealed within the ominous fog. The deaths of the six victims signify the ghosts' pursuit of justice and retribution for the atrocities committed against them a century before.

He stated that he was born in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, in 1915, but it is believed to be more likely that he was born in Jug's Corner, in neighboring Issaquena County, in 1913. Recent research has uncovered documentation showing that in the 1930s and 1940s, before his rise to fame, the year of his birth was reported as 1913 on his marriage license, recording notes, and musicians' union card. A 1955 interview in the Chicago Defender is the earliest in which he stated 1915 as the year of his birth, and he continued to say this in interviews from that point onward. In August 1941, Alan Lomax went to Stovall, Mississippi, on behalf of the Library of Congress to record various country blues musicians. \\"He brought his stuff down and recorded me right in my house,\\" Muddy recalled for Rolling Stone magazine, \\"and when he played back the first song I sounded just like anybody's records. Man, you don't know how I felt that Saturday afternoon when I heard that voice and it was my own voice. Later on he sent me two copies of the pressing and a check for twenty bucks, and I carried that record up to the corner and put it on the jukebox. Just played it and played it and said, 'I can do it, I can do it.'\\" Lomax came back in July 1942 to record him again. Both sessions were eventually released by Testament Records as Down on Stovall's Plantation. The complete recordings were reissued by Chess Records on CD as Muddy Waters: The Complete Plantation Recordings. The Historic 1941-42 Library of Congress Field Recordings in 1993 and remastered in 1997. In 1943, Muddy Waters headed to Chicago with the hope of becoming a full-time professional musician. He lived with a relative for a short period while driving a truck and working in a factory by day and performing at night. Big Bill Broonzy, then one of the leading bluesmen in Chicago, had Muddy Waters open his shows in the rowdy clubs where Broonzy played. This gave Muddy Waters the opportunity to play in front of a large audience. In 1944, he bought his first electric guitar and then formed his first electric combo. He felt obliged to electrify his sound in Chicago because, he said, \\"When I went into the clubs, the first thing I wanted was an amplifier. Couldn't nobody hear you with an acoustic.\\" His sound reflected the optimism of postwar African Americans. Willie Dixon said that \\"There was quite a few people around singing the blues but most of them was singing all sad blues. Muddy was giving his blues a little pep.\\" Three years later, in 1946, he recorded some songs for Mayo Williams at Columbia Records, with an old-fashioned combo consisting of clarinet, saxophone and piano; they were released a year later with Ivan Ballen's Philadelphia-based 20th Century label, billed as James \\"Sweet Lucy\\" Carter and his Orchestra - Muddy Waters' name was not mentioned on the label.

Translate this to English?","output":"On the other hand, China provides a sobering example of what happens when state-funded health care is withdrawn. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, China began a series of economic reforms which transitioned the nation from a centrally planned economy to a market-oriented one. One aspect of these reforms was a shift in the way health care was financed and delivered. Previously, the government had provided a comprehensive, universal health care system that was accessible to all citizens. However, as part of the reform process, state funding for health care was drastically reduced, and individuals and households were made responsible for a greater share of their health care costs. Consequently, access to health care became increasingly tied to an individual's ability to pay, and the situation deteriorated over time. This change in the health care system led to several adverse consequences. Firstly, disparities in health care access and quality between the urban and rural areas increased. With the reduced state funding, many rural health care providers were no longer able to deliver the same level of care that they had in the past. As a result, rural residents faced greater difficulties in accessing quality health care services. In contrast, urban citizens, who typically had higher incomes, were better able to afford the growing cost of health care. Secondly, the shift to a market-oriented health care system led to a significant rise in out-of-pocket health care expenses for Chinese citizens. The lack of a strong social health insurance system, combined with skyrocketing health care costs, forced many families to bear the financial burden of medical care, potentially leading to catastrophic health expenditures and pushing some households into poverty. Thirdly, the reduction in government funding for health care coincided with a decline in preventative and public health efforts. Many effective public health campaigns and programs, which had been responsible for the control of infectious diseases and improvements in overall population health, were neglected or abandoned. This decline contributed to a resurgence in infectious diseases such as hepatitis and the reemergence of tuberculosis. It was only in the early 2000s that the Chinese government began to acknowledge the failures of the health care system and initiated a series of health care reforms aimed at improving access, affordability, and quality of care. These reforms included increased government spending on health care, the expansion of health insurance coverage, and the strengthening of primary care and public health services. In conclusion, the experience of China during its economic transition serves as a sobering example of the potential consequences of withdrawing state-funded health care. The reforms led to widening disparities in health care access and quality, rising out-of-pocket health care expenses, a decline in preventative and public health efforts, and ultimately, deteriorating health outcomes for many citizens. As countries and governments around the world evaluate their health care systems, the lessons from China's experience provide essential insights into the importance of maintaining a strong, equitable, and accessible health care system for all."},{"instruction":"Background: Ronnie and Reggie Kray were born on 24 October 1933 in Hoxton, East London, to Charles David Kray (10 March 1907 - 8 March 1983), a scrap gold dealer, and Violet Annie Lee (5 August 1909 - 4 August 1982). They were of English, Jewish, Irish and Romani Gypsy heritage. The brothers were identical twins, with Reggie being born ten minutes before Ronnie. Their parents already had a six-year-old son, Charles James (9 July 1927 - 4 April 2000). Context: Ronnie Kray shot and killed George Cornell, a member of the Richardsons (a rival South London gang), at the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel on 9 March 1966. The day before, there had been a shoot-out at Mr. Smith's, a nightclub in Catford, involving the Richardson gang and Richard Hart, an associate of the Krays, who was shot dead. This public shoot-out led to the arrest of nearly all the Richardson gang. Cornell, by chance, was not present at the club during the shoot-out and was not arrested. Whilst visiting the hospital to check up on his friends, he randomly chose to visit the Blind Beggar pub, only a mile away from where the Krays lived. Ronnie was drinking in another pub when he learned of Cornell's location. He went there with his driver \\"Scotch Jack\\" John Dickson and his assistant Ian Barrie. Ronnie went into the pub with Barrie, walked straight to Cornell and shot him in the head in public view. Barrie, confused by what happened, fired five shots in the air warning the public not to report what had happened to the police. Just before he was shot, Cornell remarked, \\"Well, look who's here.\\" He died at 3:00am in hospital. Ronnie Kray was already suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the killing. According to some sources, Ronnie killed Cornell because Cornell referred to Ronnie as a \\"fat poof\\" (a derogatory term for gay men) during a confrontation between the Krays and the Richardson gang at the Astor Club on Christmas Day 1965. Richardson gang member \\"Mad\\" Frankie Fraser was tried for the murder of Richard Hart at Mr.Smith's, but was found not guilty. Richardson gang member Ray \\"the Belgian\\" Cullinane testified that he saw Cornell kicking Hart. Witnesses would not co-operate with the police in the murder case due to intimidation, and the trial ended inconclusively without pointing to any suspect in particular. Question: Was Ronnie charged?.

His mother, Ann Lee (nee Jeffries) Stearns, originally from Kentucky, was a teacher at Riverdale Country School as Lee Whedon, and an aspiring novelist. His parents had both acted, and appeared in a play together at the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club. Whedon is the younger sibling of Samuel and Matthew Whedon and older sibling of writers Jed and Zack Whedon. As a result of the success of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Whedon was allowed the opportunity to make his 1999 spin-off series, Angel. David Greenwalt and Whedon collaborated on the pilot that was going to be developed for The WB Network. During the series' early expansion, efforts were made by the network to mitigate Whedon's original concept. \\"Corrupt\\", a precociously optioned second episode, was entirely abandoned due to the gloominess written into the script. The tone was consequently softened, establishing in the opening episodes Angel Investigations as an idealistic, shoestring operation. It follows Angel, who works as a private detective in order to \\"help the helpless\\". Though praised for presenting a unique and progressive version of the archetypal noir hero as a sympathetic vampire detective, it was criticized as being lesser than its parent show, in context of having been derived from a more popular original work. Despite this, it won a Saturn Award for Best Network TV Series and the three episodes \\"Waiting in the Wings\\", \\"Smile Time\\" and \\"Not Fade Away\\" were nominated for Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form in 2003 and 2005. The WB Network announced on February 13, 2004 that Angel would not be brought back for a sixth season. Whedon said of the cancellation, \\"I believe the reason Angel had trouble on The WB was that it was the only show on the network that wasn't trying to be Buffy. It was a show about grown-ups\\". An official continuation of the story came rather in the form of a comic book series. Following the successful eighth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, IDW Publishing approached Whedon about similarly producing a canonical sixth season for Angel. Angel: After the Fall released 17 issues written by Whedon and Brian Lynch. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Is Angel the name of a show?","output":"Yes, Angel is the name of a show. The quote from the article that supports this is: \\"As a result of the success of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Whedon was allowed the opportunity to make his 1999 spin-off series, Angel.\\""},{"instruction":"Is ply used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences?

A:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what causes different shapes of the moon to appear?\\" is not \\"physical weathering.\\" Instead, the phenomenon responsible for the different shapes of the moon is the relative positions of the Earth, Moon, and the Sun, which cause variations in the portion of the moon illuminated by sunlight and visible to us on Earth. This process is known as \\"lunar phases.\\" The Moon orbits the Earth in an elliptical path, and as it does so, its illuminated half (lit by the Sun) changes in appearance from our perspective on Earth. When the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun, we see no illuminated portion – this is known as a new moon. As it continues its orbit and the illuminated portion gradually increases, we have the first quarter (or waxing crescent), the full moon, the last quarter (or waning crescent), and finally back to the new moon again. This entire cycle takes about 29.5 days and is called the synodic month or lunar month. Physical weathering, in contrast, refers to the gradual breakdown of rocks and minerals due to environmental factors like wind, rain, and fluctuations in temperature. While the Moon does experience some weathering from meteorite impacts and solar radiation, this process doesn't impact the lunar phases that we observe from Earth."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping \\"wasn't very obvious\\" due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface, even by the video tutorial added on the RTM release (which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides). Despite this \\"stumbling block\\", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \\"Metro\\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was \\"as stunning as it is surprising\\", contributing to an \\"incredibly personal\\" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it \\"two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together\\"), and concluded that \\"Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.\\"\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, a writer for ZDNet, expressed his thoughts on the origins of the Windows 8 interface as an attempt by Microsoft to shape the PC industry and remain relevant amidst the growing popularity of touch devices and tablets, such as Apple's iPad. He believed that the interface was not developed in response to actual needs or demands from users but rather as a strategic move by Microsoft to compete against its rivals and maintain a strong foothold in the industry. Kingsley-Hughes further criticized the Windows 8 interface for being \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to the inconsistent design between the \\"Metro\\" environment and the classic desktop view. He perceived the interface as an amalgamation of two operating systems that were awkwardly and abruptly connected, which resulted in a disjointed user experience. This inconsistency in design made navigating the operating system difficult and confusing for users, as they would have to switch between the two different environments. Moreover, Kingsley-Hughes argued that the lack of clear instructions on how to utilize the new touch-based interface, such as the hot corners and edge swiping features, contributed to the overall negative reception of the operating system. The video tutorial added in the RTM release proved to be insufficient, as it only instructed users to point at the corners of the screen or swipe from its sides without explaining the functions of accessing the user interface. Despite these criticisms, some, like Tom Warren of The Verge, acknowledged the necessity for Microsoft to adopt a touch-oriented interface to push app development for the Windows Store and adapt to the changing landscape of the tech industry. However, even Warren conceded that the learning curve associated with the new interface was steep and its integration with a keyboard and mouse setup was clunky and uncomfortable. Overall, Adrian Kingsley-Hughes' thoughts on the origins of the Windows 8 interface revolve around the idea that the design was driven by Microsoft's desire to assert its influence on the PC industry and adapt to the growing trend of touch and tablet devices. Although the interface showed potential in some aspects, its clumsy and inconsistent design, coupled with the lack of clear instructions, resulted in a negative user experience that left many users displeased and frustrated with the operating system."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"\\"La vida es un sueño y los sueños, sueños son.\\" This sentence is in Spanish and translates to \\"Life is a dream and dreams, dreams are.\\" It is a famous quote from the Spanish play \\"La vida es sueño\\" (1635) written by Pedro Calderón de la Barca, a renowned Spanish playwright and poet of the Spanish Golden Age.

Possible A: kitchen floor, furniture, house, mobile home, own land Why is \\"mobile home\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Mobile home\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. First, let's analyze the question and the context it provides: \\"Where do you live if you have cheap linoleum covering and boxy rooms?\\" The question is essentially asking for a type of living space characterized by these specific attributes: 1. Cheap linoleum covering: Linoleum is an affordable flooring material that has been commonly used in a variety of residential settings, including mobile homes. It is durable, inexpensive, and easy to install, which makes it an ideal choice for living spaces that need to be cost-effective and functional. 2. Boxy rooms: Boxy rooms refer to spaces with limited architectural design and simple, rectangular shapes. This description may be indicative of a living environment that is designed with practicality and affordability in mind, which is a common characteristic of mobile homes. Now, looking at the possible answers: a. Kitchen floor: This answer refers to a part of a house rather than the type of living space itself, so it doesn't align with the context provided by the question. b. Furniture: This answer is not relevant, as it refers to objects within a living space rather than the living space itself. c. House: While a house could potentially have both cheap linoleum covering and boxy rooms, the question is presenting a specific combination of features that seems to be hinting at a more particular type of living arrangement, which makes \\"house\\" a less fitting answer. d. Mobile home: As mentioned earlier, a mobile home is a type of affordable, functional living space that often features inexpensive linoleum flooring and boxy, rectangular rooms, making it a suitable answer to the question given the specific attributes mentioned. e. Own land: This answer refers to property ownership rather than the type of living space, making it irrelevant to the question's context.

The magazine is known for its investigative journalism, political commentaries, and cultural analysis, covering topics such as social issues, economics, and the arts. Born in the mid-1950s, it has since then played a key role in shaping public opinion through its in-depth articles and outstanding journalism. While there are a number of news magazines and dailies that compete with l'Espresso in the Italian media landscape, its biggest rival is Panorama. Panorama is a prominent Italian weekly news magazine founded in 1962 and published by the Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, Italy's largest publishing company. Similar to l'Espresso, Panorama provides its readers with extensive coverages on current events, politics, economy, culture, and entertainment. Both l'Espresso and Panorama have strong readerships, and they appeal to different segments of the Italian public. While l'Espresso is known for its liberal and progressive perspective, often delving deep into social injustices and political corruption, Panorama is considered to have a more center-right leaning and is affiliated with Silvio Berlusconi's media empire. This places Panorama in a more conservative political space, compared to l'Espresso's left-leaning position. Throughout the years, the rivalry between l'Espresso and Panorama has been fueled by their contrasting editorial stances and unique journalistic styles. Competing for the same target audience, these leading Italian weekly news magazines continue to vie for supremacy, each striving to be the primary source of credible and well-informed content to their readers. In conclusion, Panorama is l'Espresso's biggest rival in the Italian weekly news magazine market, with both publications occupying significant positions within the country's media landscape. Their contrasting political affiliations and editorial approaches contribute to their ongoing competition to earn and maintain the trust and attention of readers in Italy and abroad."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What does Nanjing University library contain?\\" is in \\"Nanjing Library, founded in 1907, houses more than 10 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the National Library in Beijing and Shanghai Library.

This might seem counterintuitive at first, as most people would prefer shorter routes when going from one place to another. However, there are several reasons why Fran preferred the alleyway over the sidewalk for her journey back home. First, Fran was an avid fitness enthusiast. She had a daily goal of walking a certain number of steps, and she knew that taking the alleyway would allow her to cover more ground and meet her daily target. By deliberately choosing the longer route, she was able to not only maintain her personal commitment to her fitness, but also enjoy the additional physical benefits of walking more. The alleyway provided her with an opportunity to burn more calories and improve her cardiovascular health while still getting her to her destination. Second, Fran was very fond of the scenery and the sense of serenity the alleyway had to offer. Whereas the sidewalk was often bustling with people, traffic noises and busy storefronts, the alleyway provided her with a peaceful environment where she could unwind and reflect on her day. She appreciated the quieter moments she could have while surrounded by vines, old brick walls, and the occasional blooming flower in the unperturbed atmosphere of the alleyway. Third, Fran often found herself wanting to avoid the social obligations that came with walking down the sidewalk. She was an introverted person who cherished her solitude and often found the prospect of small talk with neighbors or acquaintances more stressful than enjoyable. By taking the alleyway, she could comfortably avoid bumping into individuals she knew and having to engage in conversation when she preferred silence. Lastly, Fran felt a strong sense of nostalgia when walking down the alleyway. When she was younger, she and her friends used to play games or ride their bikes in the alleyways around her neighborhood. These memories remained vivid in her mind, and by taking the alleyway instead of the sidewalk, she could relive those cherished moments in her thoughts as she made her way home. In conclusion, Fran made the conscious choice of taking the alleyway to her home instead of the sidewalk for a multitude of reasons. Not only did it allow her to meet her daily fitness goals, but it also provided her with an opportunity to escape from the hustle and bustle of life, engage in introspection, and cherish her nostalgic memories. While this may not be the preference for everyone, for Fran, the alleyway was her preferred route to her final destination."},{"instruction":"Question: Facts: - clubs: fc fc spartak tambov spartak tambov fc avangard podolsk -lrb- d4 -rrb- - caps: 7 58 8 - position: defender - years: 2006-2007 2008 2009 - height: 1.77 - pcupdate: 22:44 , 19 august 2009 -lrb- utc -rrb- - birth date: 1 february 1984 - fullname: maksim vladimirovich vlasov - name: maksim vlasov - goals: 0 1 0 Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of maksim vladimirovich vlasov .

This view largely relies on the high incidences of trauma that have been reported1,2 and have variously been attributed to violent social behaviour3,4, highly mobile hunter-gatherer lifestyles2 or attacks by carnivores5. The described Neanderthal pattern of predominantly cranial injuries is further thought to reflect violent encounters with large prey mammals, resulting from the use of close-range hunting weapons1. These interpretations directly shape our understanding of Neanderthal lifestyles, health and hunting abilities, yet mainly rest on descriptive, case-based evidence. Quantitative, population-level studies of traumatic injuries are rare. Here we reassess the hypothesis of higher cranial trauma prevalence among Neanderthals using a population-level approach—accounting for preservation bias and other contextual data—and an exhaustive fossil database. We show that Neanderthals and early Upper Palaeolithic anatomically modern humans exhibit similar overall incidences of cranial trauma, which are higher for males in both taxa, consistent with patterns shown by later populations of modern humans. Beyond these similarities, we observed species-specific, age-related variation in trauma prevalence, suggesting that there were differences in the timing of injuries during life or that there was a differential mortality risk of trauma survivors in the two groups. Finally, our results highlight the importance of preservation bias in studies of trauma prevalence. ||||| Injuries are part of everyday life, from a scratch on the skin to a broken bone to a fatal trauma. Although many injuries are accidental, others can arise as a consequence of an individual’s or a group’s behaviour, activity or social norms — characteristics that tell us about societies and the inherent tensions and risks within and between different groups. Writing in Nature, Beier et al.1 provide evidence that challenges the long-standing view2 that Neanderthal populations experienced a level of traumatic injuries that was significantly higher than that of humans. The result calls into question claims2,3 that the behaviour and technologies of Neanderthals exposed them to particularly high levels of risk and danger. Read the paper: Similar cranial trauma prevalence among Neanderthals and Upper Palaeolithic modern humans Reports of injuries and deaths are constantly in the news. As well as being drawn to read the stories of individuals, such information is of interest because of what it tells us about our societies. However, to fully understand what might determine the current degree of violence and injuries, we also need to look back at the past and identify the causal underpinnings. But how far back should we look? Arguably, right back to the evolutionary origins of processes that shape behavioural, social and cognitive tendencies and abilities. Anthropologists study skeletal remains to reconstruct aspects of ancient lives, building an ‘osteobiography’ that casts light on part of the life history of an individual. Skeletons preserve — in the form of holes, misshapen surfaces, bone misalignments and secondary fractures radiating out from a point of impact — a signature of the traumas that resulted in fractured, cut or perforated bones, even if the injuries subsequently healed4,5. Traumatic lesions have been frequently identified in Neanderthal fossils, particularly in the head (Fig. 1) and neck, leading to the view2 that higher levels of skeletal injury occurred in Neanderthal populations than in human populations. However, this is not so, say Beier and colleagues. The authors assessed published descriptions of Neanderthal and modern human fossil skulls found in Eurasia from approximately 80,000 to 20,000 years ago. Comparing the number of injured and non-injured Neanderthal and human skulls, the authors report similar levels of head trauma in both groups. Figure 1 | A Neanderthal skull. The Neanderthal fossil called Saint-Césaire 1. This fossil9 shows signs of a healed bone injury10 in the region indicated by the arrowheads. Beier et al.1 assessed published analyses of ancient Neanderthal and human skulls, including that of Saint-Césaire 1. Contrary to the prevailing view2 that Neanderthal existence was more violent than that of humans, the authors report that similar levels of trauma are present in Neanderthal and human fossils. The power of Beier and colleagues’ analyses lies in their study design. Instead of comparing Neanderthal data with those of more-recent or living human populations, as previous studies have done2,6, the authors based their comparisons on humans who not only shared aspects of their environment with Neanderthals, but whose fossil record also has a similar level of preservation. Beier et al. analysed data for 114 Neanderthal skulls and 90 human skulls. They gathered the data for 14 skull bones, and obtained information that ranged from 1 bone in poorly preserved fossils to data for all 14 bones per individual for well-preserved ones. In total, the authors recorded trauma incidence in 295 Neanderthal bones and 541 human bones. They also collected other information, such as the percentage of each of the 14 bones that was preserved for each individual, as well as details including sex, age at death and the fossil’s geographic location. Beier et al. ran two sets of statistical analyses — one based on the presence or absence of trauma in each of the skull bones, the other on individual fossil skulls as a whole — to test whether there were any statistically significant differences between the prevalence of trauma in the Neanderthal and human fossils. The authors also assessed whether trauma prevalence was linked to sex or age, taking into account fossil preservation, geographic location and possible interaction effects between the different variables. The two analyses gave similar results. The more complete the fossils are, the more likely they are to have preserved evidence of injuries. This might seem obvious, but is an issue often ignored in such studies. Beier et al. offer a way to deal with this type of bias in the available material. Once the authors take into account the extent of fossil preservation, the predicted prevalence of trauma in Neanderthals and humans is almost the same. Both Neanderthal and human males had a much greater incidence of trauma than did the females of their respective species. This pattern remains the same for humans today7. One final intriguing result is that, although traumatic injuries were present across all of the age ranges studied, Neanderthals that had trauma to the head were more likely to have died under the age of 30 than the humans were. The authors interpret this result as evidence that, compared with humans, Neanderthals either had more injuries when they were young or were more likely to have died after being injured. Beier and colleagues’ study does not invalidate previous estimates of trauma among Neanderthals. Instead, it provides a new framework for interpreting these data by showing that the level of Neanderthal trauma was not uniquely high relative to that of early humans in Eurasia. This implies that Neanderthal trauma does not require its own special explanations, and that risk and danger were as much a part of the life of Neanderthals as they were of our own evolutionary past. The result adds to growing evidence that Neanderthals had much in common with early human groups. However, the finding that Neanderthals might have experienced trauma at a younger age than humans, or that they had a greater risk of death after injury, is fascinating, and might be a key insight into why our species had such a demographic advantage over Neanderthals. Is this the final word on the subject of Neanderthal trauma? The answer is no. Beier and colleagues assessed only skull trauma. What if Neanderthals accumulated more injuries to their bodies than did humans? There are data suggesting that this might be the case8. Furthermore, although the authors’ analyses demonstrate the power of a well-designed study based on large samples, the data they used were recorded by many researchers and at varying levels of detail, raising the possibility of methodological biases. Lastly, the causes of the injuries could provide some elusive insights into behaviour, activities or social norms in the past. From the shape, location and extent of traumatic injuries in skeletons, and characteristics such as the sharpness of fracture edges or the degree to which injuries had healed, it is sometimes possible to establish the most likely cause of a trauma — for example, whether the injury probably arose as a consequence of a hunting accident3, interpersonal violence10 or inter-group conflict11. Moreover, surviving severe trauma might indicate that the injured person was cared for by members of their society12. Establishing the likelihood of each of these scenarios among Neanderthals and early modern humans will no doubt continue to challenge scientists for many years to come. ||||| Maybe Neanderthals Weren't Quite So Nasty And Brutish Enlarge this image toggle caption Gleiver Prieto & Katerina Harvati Gleiver Prieto & Katerina Harvati Neanderthals might bring to mind images of cartoonish brutes whacking each other with clubs. But even though a number of Neanderthal skeletons have been unearthed showing grave head and neck injuries, new research suggests their lives weren't as violent as the stereotype implies. In fact, the levels of cranial injuries for Neanderthals are very similar to those of early modern humans, according to scientists whose work was published today in the journal Nature. \\"There is no statistical difference between the two, which means that they cannot be differentiated,\\" says study co-author Katerina Harvati, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Tübingen in Germany. \\"I definitely think that it's evidence these guys were not beating each other up,\\" at least not any more than early modern humans, says Fred Smith, an Illinois State University professor specializing in Neanderthals who was not involved in the research. Smith says he's not surprised by the results, and that for many years, \\"there was a lot of focus on emphasizing the differences between Neanderthals and us.\\" That changed in 2010, when scientists found that Neanderthals contributed genetic material to modern humans, making them an early relative. Since then, a flurry of research has challenged the image of Neanderthals as savage troglodytes. Researchers have suggested they may have made art, enjoyed long childhoods, sometimes ate vegetarian diets and even wore jewelry and makeup. The researchers put together a database from published articles that described the bones of 204 individual Neanderthals and early Upper Paleolithic modern humans, including cranial injuries. The specimens came from what is now Europe and Asia, and date back approximately 20,000 to 80,000 years ago. In both groups, males were more likely to have cranial injuries than females — which, according to the University of Tübingen, is \\"explained by division of labor between men and women or by culturally determined sex-specific behaviors and activities.\\" And though the level of head trauma between Neanderthals and early modern humans was statistically the same, Neanderthals who sustained head trauma before they were 30 were more likely to also die younger. \\"This finding does not necessarily mean the modern humans survived longer, but instead could result from Neanderthals sustaining cranial injuries earlier in life than Upper Paleolithic modern humans,\\" she says. \\"[Or] it could also indicate that Neanderthals had a higher risk of mortality after surviving cranial injuries as compared to Upper Paleolithic modern humans.\\" It could also mean that early modern humans were better at taking care of their injured. Harvati says there were probably many causes of these head injuries. Besides hunting and inter-personal violence, cranial injuries in both groups were likely caused by \\"accidents from a highly mobile hunter-gatherer lifestyle in glacial environments as well as carnivore attacks.\\" It's worth noting that the researchers are comparing Neanderthals to early modern humans because they are most likely to have had a similar lifestyle. Comparing Neanderthals to humans today, says Harvati, would be like comparing \\"apples to oranges.\\" She adds that modern-day humans, of course, face \\"a completely different range of dangers which can result in extremely severe traumatic injuries, which simply did not exist among Neanderthals or Paleolithic modern humans.\\" Dangers such as car accidents — or ballistic trauma from firearms. |||||","output":"A long time ago, there were people called Neanderthals who lived on Earth. Some scientists thought Neanderthals lived very dangerous lives because many of their skulls showed signs of injuries. This made people believe that their lives were full of violence and struggles. But new research shows that Neanderthals might not have had lives that were more dangerous than early humans. Scientists studied and compared the skulls of Neanderthals and early humans and discovered that both groups had similar levels of head injuries. This tells us that Neanderthals were not much more violent than early humans. The reason why Neanderthals and early humans had these head injuries could be due to accidents, hunting, fighting with each other, or even being attacked by animals. So, it is important to remember that Neanderthals were not so different from early humans."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The first MP4 player was born years ago. Soon many music fans were wondering how fantastic it is! If you have been into technology enough, perhaps you may have a knowledge of the MP4.

If the pot of soup has 6 gallons of soup, how long will it take Erin to serve all the soup, rounded to the nearest minute? (There are 128 ounces to a gallon.) What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: 15?","output":"Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: 1. First, we need to determine how many total ounces of soup are in the pot. We know there are 6 gallons of soup, and each gallon contains 128 ounces. Therefore, we need to multiply the number of gallons (6) by the number of ounces per gallon (128) to find the total number of ounces: 6 gallons * 128 ounces/gallon = 768 ounces 2. Next, we need to calculate how many total bowls of soup can be made from the pot, given that each bowl contains 10 ounces. To do this, we divide the total number of ounces in the pot by the number of ounces per bowl: 768 ounces ÷ 10 ounces/bowl = 76.8 bowls Since Erin can only serve whole bowls of soup, you'll need to round this number down to the nearest whole number for practical purposes. 76.8 bowls ≈ 76 bowls (rounded down) 3. Now we have to find out how long it will take Erin to serve all the soup, given her serving rate of 5 bowls per minute. To do this, we divide the total number of bowls by the number of bowls Erin can serve per minute: 76 bowls ÷ 5 bowls/minute ≈ 15.2 minutes 4.

Indianapolis covers , making it the 16th largest city by land area in the U.S. - In the United States, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the area. Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be, nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states. As such, the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source. A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region (e.g., Chicago or Atlanta). However, some metropolitan areas contain more than one large city with no single municipality holding a substantially dominant position (e.g., DallasFort Worth metroplex, Norfolk-Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), RiversideSan Bernardino (Inland Empire) or MinneapolisSaint Paul). - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - Robert James \\"Bob\\" Kevoian (born December 2, 1950) is a retired American radio host of the nationally syndicated radio show \\"The Bob & Tom Show\\" together with his partner, Tom Griswold.

However, it may still be possible for several reasons. Arizona Business Magazine is a leading monthly business magazine in the state, which implies that it discusses prevalent and notable businesses and events in Arizona. As Microsoft is a prominent company globally and may have a presence or impact on the business scene within Arizona, there is a possibility that the magazine has covered or will cover Microsoft in the future. The magazine primarily targets high-level corporate executives and business owners as its audience.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Well, when thinking about a sealed box that we might encounter, there could be various items inside it that we need to consider. Some of these items could be fragile, while others could be sturdy. The box may contain multiple smaller objects or just one larger object. Sometimes, the items inside may be cushioned with packing materials, so when we try to shake the box, the movement could be muffled, and it would be difficult to ascertain exactly what's inside. Moreover, the weight distribution of the contents could potentially provide us with some clues, but it would still not guarantee the precision in identifying the specific items. For example, you might have two boxes of the same size and weight, but one contains a solid metal ball, and the other has multiple small marbles. Shaking both these boxes might produce similar sounds, but without opening them, we wouldn't know what is inside. Furthermore, certain things may even be packed securely so that they don't produce any sound when the box is shaken. Optical or X-ray scanning techniques might be helpful in some cases, but they won't work on every object, and it's also not practical to use them all the time. In conclusion, it is not possible to tell the exact contents of a sealed box just by shaking it, as the variables involved are too many, and there are limitations to what our senses or even technology can perceive."},{"instruction":"Write an email with the following subject: Anderson '96 Reunion - 10 Days and Counting!","output":"Step 1: Review the email's purpose and audience The purpose of this email is to remind and excite the recipients about the upcoming Anderson '96 Reunion.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the provided answer is correct to some extent. However, it doesn't fully explain how UV light activates fluorescence, which is the core of your question. Let me explain it step-by-step: 1. Fluorescence occurs when a molecule absorbs light (photons) at a specific wavelength (usually in the ultraviolet or visible range) and then emits light at a longer wavelength. This is due to electronic transitions within the molecule. 2. When a molecule absorbs UV light, it promotes an electron from its ground state to an excited state. This process is called absorption. 3. The excited state is unstable, and the molecule will eventually return to its ground state. As the electron returns to the ground state, it releases energy in the form of light, which is the observed fluorescence. 4. The emitted light typically has a higher wavelength (lower energy) than the absorbed light. This is known as the Stokes shift and is related to the energy difference between the ground and excited states. To answer your question more directly, UV light activates fluorescence in a molecule by providing the necessary energy for molecular transitions. The absorbed radiation (UV light) excites the electrons in the molecule, leading to electronic transitions and ultimately resulting in the emission of light at a longer wavelength (fluorescence)."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you will be shown a Persian passage and a question, and you have to determine whether the question is answerable based on the passage or not.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"In order to assess the relationship between the premise (\\"The Beats were cool\\") and the hypothesis (\\"The Beats were cool, but overpriced\\"), we must first understand the logical structure of each statement and then examine whether the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the hypothesis. The Premise: \\"The Beats were cool\\" This statement asserts that the Beats, possibly referring to the Beat Generation (a group of American writers in the 1950s) or Beats Electronics products (known for their headphones and speakers), possessed a certain level of appeal or allure. The term \\"cool\\" is somewhat subjective, as it might refer to different qualities for different people, but it generally implies that the Beats were admired, interesting, or stylish in some way. The Hypothesis: \\"The Beats were cool, but overpriced\\" This statement also asserts that the Beats were cool, as in the premise; however, it adds the conditional term \\"but,\\" suggesting that there exists a negative aspect or drawback to the Beats. In this case, the drawback is that they were \\"overpriced,\\" meaning that their cost was greater than their perceived value or worth. To determine whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis, we will examine each statement for logical consistency. 1. If \\"The Beats were cool\\" is true, does that necessarily imply that \\"The Beats were cool, but overpriced\\" is also true? No, the truth of the premise does not necessarily guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. This is because the hypothesis contains a conditional statement that is not present in the premise. While both statements agree on the fact that the Beats were cool, the hypothesis introduces the additional element of being overpriced. In other words, it is entirely possible for the Beats to be cool without being overpriced. Perhaps their pricing accurately reflects their value, or they might even be underpriced for the level of \\"cool\\" they offer. There is no intrinsic link between being cool and being overpriced. 2. Does the hypothesis logically follow from the premise? The hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. While they share the assessment that the Beats were cool, the premise does not provide any information about their price or value. Logically, the hypothesis would only be guaranteed if the premise stated that the Beats were cool and overpriced. As it stands, the premise only addresses the \\"coolness\\" factor, leaving the question of price and value unexplored. In conclusion, based on these analyses, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise (\\"The Beats were cool\\") is true, then the hypothesis (\\"The Beats were cool, but overpriced\\") is necessarily true as well. The two statements evaluate different aspects of the Beats, with the hypothesis introducing an additional factor (price) not present in the premise. To establish a necessary link between the two statements, more information is needed to substantiate the conditional aspect introduced in the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Hitler's death by his own hand cannot be counted as one of history's accidents.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Lots of events led Hilter to kill himself.\\" true? Select from the following. (I). yes. (II). it is not possible to tell. (III). no.","output":"(I). Yes, the hypothesis \\"Lots of events led Hitler to kill himself\\" can be considered true based on the given premise. There were numerous events and circumstances which ultimately led Adolf Hitler to commit suicide. Some of the significant factors that contributed to his decision include: 1. Military setbacks: By the time of Hitler's death, which was on April 30, 1945, the German military had suffered a series of crushing defeats at the hands of the Allies. The turning point in World War II began with the invasion of the Soviet Union, known as Operation Barbarossa. The continuous defeats and retreats of German forces, as well as the subsequent invasion of Germany by the Allies, left Hitler with few options and he was facing certain defeat. 2. Loss of support: As the war progressed and the German situation became more dire, many of Hitler's closest allies and key military officers either turned against him or were no longer available to provide support. This left Hitler increasingly isolated and distrustful, diminishing his ability to coordinate a viable strategy for the remaining German forces. The failed assassination attempt by Claus von Stauffenberg in July 1944 also played a role in Hitler's loss of trust in his military officers. 3. Declining health: In the final years of his life, Hitler's health was deteriorating rapidly. He suffered from various ailments, including Parkinson's disease, gastrointestinal issues, and drug addiction. His health issues likely limited his ability to make sound decisions and may have contributed to his increasing sense of desperation. 4. Psychological factors: Given the intensity of the war, the weight of leading a nation, and his constant struggles to maintain control, Hitler was under tremendous psychological pressure. As the situation worsened, the burden of responsibility and the encroaching threat of defeat likely took a substantial toll on his mental health, resulting in his belief that suicide was the only option. 5. Fear of capture and humiliation: With the Allies closing in on his hideout in the Führerbunker, Hitler faced the possibility of capture and being put on trial for war crimes. His fear of being humiliated and subjected to public disgrace may have played a major role in his decision to take his own life and maintain control over his legacy. In conclusion, the combination of military defeats, loss of support, declining health, psychological factors, and the fear of capture contributed to Hitler's decision to commit suicide. These events align with the premise, and thus, the hypothesis \\"Lots of events led Hitler to kill himself\\" can be considered true."},{"instruction":"Reconstruct a question, answer pair from this explanation: If it's a cold night then the woman is not in a warm place.","output":"Question: Is the woman in a warm place on a cold night?

The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes.

Like its analogs printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \\"play back\\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.

Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\\" Answer:","output":"Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit, or the unique cultural identity associated with Ashkenazi Jews, originated from the diverse historical, religious, and cultural experiences of Jewish communities residing in Central and Eastern Europe. The development of Yiddishkeit was influenced by various factors such as the migration of Jewish communities throughout Europe, their interaction with surrounding non-Jewish cultures, the religious and cultural practices adopted by these communities, as well as the challenges they faced due to persecution and discrimination. Jewish migration to Europe began in the late Roman period, with the Jewish population expanding into the Rhineland region (comprising present-day Germany and France) during the 9th and 10th centuries. Here, they were exposed to a new cultural milieu, as they came into contact with the Germanic and Latin-speaking Christian population. These early Ashkenazi communities began to develop their unique Jewish identity through the synthesis of their traditional Jewish practices and customs with elements of their new European environment. The development of the Yiddish language itself played a crucial role in shaping Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit. Yiddish, with its combination of Hebrew, Aramaic, German, and Slavic elements, emerged as the lingua franca of Ashkenazi Jewish communities. The Yiddish language not only facilitated communication within the Jewish diaspora but also became an essential medium through which Ashkenazi Jews expressed their religious and cultural beliefs as well as their creativity, including literature, poetry, and theater. The distinctive religious practices of Ashkenazi Jews also contributed to the development of Yiddishkeit. The study of sacred texts like the Torah and Talmud, adherence to Jewish Law, and observance of rituals and holidays formed the core of Ashkenazi religious life. As the Ashkenazi communities faced persecution and expulsion from various European countries, they developed a strong sense of communal solidarity and an unwavering commitment to their faith and traditions. Additionally, the rise of Hasidism in the 18th century offered a more spiritual and mystical dimension to the religious profile of Ashkenazi Jews, which contributed to a rich and diverse tapestry of Ashkenazi religious experience. Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit underwent significant changes with the advent of Haskalah, or the Jewish Enlightenment, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Haskalah aimed to modernize Jewish life by promoting secular education, embracing European culture, and advocating for the emancipation of the Jewish population. As a result, many Ashkenazi Jews began to explore various cultural, intellectual, and political movements outside traditional religious frameworks, such as secularism, socialism, and Zionism. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, continuing political and social upheaval, including the mass migration of Ashkenazi Jews to other parts of the world like the United States and the foundation of the State of Israel, further diversified and reshaped the contours of Yiddishkeit. As their diasporic experience expanded, the cultural horizons of Ashkenazi Jews grew to encompass not only religious and traditional forms of Jewishness but also an eclectic array of expressions and identities within the cultural, political, and artistic spectrum. Today, Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit represents a multifaceted and dynamic cultural identity that has evolved over centuries of complex interactions between the Jewish populations and their surrounding environments. While there has been a decline in the use of the Yiddish language, Yiddishkeit is still identifiable through the artistic and cultural expressions, values, humor, social patterns, culinary traditions, and narratives that continue to enrich the lives of Ashkenazi Jews and the broader Jewish experience."},{"instruction":"Read this article and answer this question Hoping to rebound from their Sunday night home loss to the Saints, the Cowboys flew to the Georgia Dome for a Saturday night fight with the Atlanta Falcons.

Her older siblings are brother Mac Jr. and sister Ginny. The Graces are longtime members of Macon's Liberty United Methodist Church, where Elizabeth plays the organ and Mac Sr. was once a Sunday School teacher. Grace graduated from Macon's Windsor Academy in 1977. Sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live has parodied Grace, both in and out of the context of her show, a number of times since her rise to prominence. Originally Grace was portrayed by SNL cast member Amy Poehler. Her impression featured in a parody of the Nancy Grace show during Saturday Night Live's 32nd season (In episode 7.). The sketch parodied Grace's reactions to Michael Richards infamous appearance at the laugh factory, the O.J. Simpson trial and her own parking fines. During the sketch, host Matthew Fox portrays a parking attendant whom Grace's staff have brought off the street, where he was giving Grace a parking ticket. Poehler also voiced Grace, on May 21, 2005, as part of the show's Saturday TV Funhouse segment in a Divertor sketch. During this appearance, Grace says little more than \\"[Name of celebrity in question] should fry.\\" Grace would later be impersonated by Saturday Night Live cast member Abby Elliott in the sketch 'So You've Committed A Crime... And You Think You Can Dance?', in which Grace features as a judge of the dance contest. In the sketch, Grace calls the show 'Disgusting'. Most recently, Grace was portrayed by featured player Noel Wells in Season 39, Episode 11. The sketch parodies Grace's reaction to the legalisation of Marijuana in Colorado and features host/musical guest Drake doing an impression of comedian Katt Williams. Much of Grace's dialogue from the sketch was lifted directly from an interview she conducted on January 6, 2013, with Brooke Baldwin on CNN's News Room, in particular the phrase 'I've got a sneaking suspicion that you are pro-pot. And I don't like it.' Was she afraid of getting made fun of by them?","output":"It is not certain whether Nancy Grace was afraid of getting made fun of by Saturday Night Live (SNL) or not, as she has never explicitly stated her feelings about the parodies. However, it is quite common for public figures, especially those who have a unique or polarizing personality, to be parodied on shows like SNL, which thrive on poking fun at personalities in the public eye for comedic effect. As an experienced television personality with strong opinions and a distinctive style, it is likely that Nancy Grace understands that being parodied on a show like SNL comes with the territory of being a famous personality. While some public figures may feel discomfort or embarrassment when being portrayed in a comedic or satirical manner, others may see it as a form of flattery or even a testament to their popularity and impact on popular culture. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that many celebrities have appeared on SNL and participated in sketches where they have been made fun of or parodied themselves. This reaction may range from embracing the humor in their portrayal to ignoring it entirely. In the case of Nancy Grace, there is no public evidence that she has taken any extreme positions against her portrayals on SNL or felt humiliation from the impersonations. It is possible that she may have had mixed feelings about these sketches, but her overall response and attitude are not publicly known."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: If lions live in communities called prides, then what are lion communities called? Answer choices: - complex - PDAs - groups - protected - prides - murders - flocks - dangerous Answer:","output":"Lion communities are called prides. A pride of lions typically consists of several adult females and their offspring, along with one or more adult males that serve as the dominant protectors and breeders within the group. The size of a pride can vary greatly, with some prides consisting of as few as 3 lions, while others may have 40 or more members. Prides have a complex social structure that allows them to efficiently work together as a group. Female lions, also known as lionesses, are typically related and form the core of the pride. They are responsible for hunting and providing food for the entire group. Lionesses work together in a collaborative manner to stalk and capture prey, using their exceptional stealth and speed to increase their chances of success. Male lions in a pride, on the other hand, are focused on protecting the group and its territory from rival prides or other potential threats. These males are usually related, either being siblings or cousins, and form coalitions to help support each other in warding off intruders. The dominant male, or males, have the privilege of mating with the pride's females, fathering the cubs, and ensuring the continuation of their genetic line. It is important to note that lions are not the only animals to have a unique name for their social groups. For instance, groups of crows are called murders, while gatherings of geese are referred to as flocks. These collective nouns provide a convenient and descriptive way to refer to the specific social structures that different animals form. The term \\"pride\\" for a lion community highlights the importance of cooperation and collaboration within these groups. Lions depend on one another for survival, with both males and females playing vital roles in the pride's overall success. The structure of a pride allows lions to thrive in their habitats, working together to overcome challenges like finding food, raising cubs, and defending their territory from rivals or other threats. In conclusion, lion communities are called prides. Prides are groups of lions that consist of related females, their offspring, and dominant males. This unique social structure enables a pride to work as a cohesive unit, utilizing each member's skills and strengths to ensure the successful hunting, reproduction, and protection of the community."},{"instruction":"The digestive system is the body system that digests food.

The probability of each outcome is equal, with a 50% chance of landing on heads and a 50% chance of landing on tails. Because of the inherent randomness of the process, it is not possible to tell or accurately predict the exact outcome of a specific coin toss. One might argue that with enough information, such as the initial conditions of the toss (like the exact position, velocity, and angular momentum of the coin), one could theoretically predict the outcome using physics. However, in practice, measuring these parameters with the required level of accuracy is virtually impossible. Moreover, even the slightest changes in these initial conditions, such as small imperfections in the coin or slight variations in air currents, can lead to completely different outcomes. This sensitivity to initial conditions is commonly known as the \\"butterfly effect.\\""},{"instruction":"Leo: Given the sentence \\"A group of men play soccer in the desert.\\" can we conclude that \\"A group of men play soccer in the desert for change.\\"?

A healthy-looking and well-groomed cat may simply be enjoying a stroll outdoors, while a dirty, malnourished, and scared feline could be lost or abandoned. If you do come across a seemingly lost cat, approach with caution, as frightened animals may display aggression or attempt to run away. Speak softly and calmly, and try offering food or treats to gain their trust. You should also check for any ID tags or collars, which can provide vital information regarding their ownership. If the cat isn't wearing a collar, consider using a smartphone app with a scanner to see if the cat has a microchip containing its owner's contact information. In case you still cannot determine the owner, take several photos of the cat from different angles to share on social media platforms, as well as checking local lost and found pet pages to post the pictures and see if the owner is looking for their missing companion. Additionally, you can contact local animal shelters and veterinary clinics to inform them about the lost cat, as they may be aware of any missing pet reports in the area. Be sure to monitor the cat’s whereabouts if possible, and offer shelter if the weather is dangerous or if you fear the cat might wander into a dangerous area. In the meantime, put up \\"Found Cat\\" posters in your neighborhood, with clear descriptions and a picture of the cat. Make sure to include your contact information on the poster in case the owner comes across it. While you are making efforts to locate the owner, remember to be patient and care for the cat by providing food, water, and a safe space. If, in the end, you cannot find the original owners, consult with local animal shelters to determine the best course of action, which may include fostering, adoption, or placing the cat in a suitable and loving environment."},{"instruction":"How is \\"\\"It was very dangerous.

Billed as a season highlight, with high expectations for innovation and drama, the performance regrettably failed to create the intended ripples of excitement on opening night. While the production was undeniably grand, something in its essence seemed to have gone amiss in its quest for intensity and emotion. To understand the context in which this lackluster performance transpired, it's important to bear in mind the brilliance that underpins the original work. \\"Don Carlo,\\" based on the story by German poet Friedrich Schiller, is a combination of love, politics, and sacrifice. Set against the bleak backdrop of the Spanish Inquisition, the characters navigate the intricacies of love and loyalty with heartrending intensity. When performed correctly, the audience is transported into a world that challenges the notions of love and power, and underscores the eternal relevance of Verdi's work. However, as the orchestra and cast took their turns, the electricity that courses through the veins of this classic opera was noticeably absent. The conductor appeared detached, unable to elicit the compelling contrasts and dynamic finesse from the musicians that would breathe life into Verdi's score. Although technically proficient, the orchestra played without the requisite emotional investment, rendering the audience underwhelmed. Moreover, the singers, despite the beautiful voices that reverberated throughout the hallowed halls of La Scala, seemed to struggle to bring the depth and nuance of their characters to life. The chemistry that should have unified the cast was markedly lacking, leaving the portrayal of the heartrending story disjointed and inconsistent. The palpable tension that gradually builds between Carlo and Elisabetta's tormented love and Felipe II's iron-fisted rule was strikingly absent, muting the impact of the narrative's climax on the audience. The visual and artistic components of the production also played a dubious role in the night's disappointment. The stage design was cluttered, inhibiting the free-flowing movement of the story and the cast's interactions. The period costumes, though impressive, did not play a role in enhancing the drama unfolded on stage. The meticulously choreographed ensemble scenes, usually a hallmark of the opera, were marred by a lack of synchronicity and cohesion, failing to evoke the electric chills of awe that they typically inspire. It is regrettable that, despite its grandiosity and seemingly inexhaustible potential, La Scala's production of \\"Don Carlo\\" ultimately failed to ignite the collective imagination of its audience. While every aspect of the performance was undoubtedly competent, the lack of passion and emotion attenuated the overall impact. As fans of the art form, we can only hope that this esteemed institution and its talented performers will learn from this experience and endeavor to reignite the flames in their future productions. The enduring magic of Verdi's \\"Don Carlo\\" demands nothing less than wholehearted devotion from all who undertake it, and it is that elusive intensity that must be recaptured for its true brilliance to shine forth."},{"instruction":"Information: - The Daytime Emmy Award is an American accolade bestowed by the New Yorkbased National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in recognition of excellence in American daytime television programming.

But this Rolls-Royce Phantom, with its brash red and chrome paint job, seems rather to have missed the point. The garish car, which sports an Arabic number plate, was spotted last night in Kensington, west London – a traditional night-time haunt of the rich and famous. Not one for traditionalists: This bright red Rolls-Royce Phantom was spotted in upmarket Kensington, but the cars normally appear in reserved shades of black, silver, cream or deep blue. Garish: The car, which sports an Arabic number plate, was spotted in Kensington, west London - a traditional night-time haunt of the rich and famous. The car, which was parked up for the evening, featured blacked-out windows which made it impossible to make out any of the traditionally luxurious interior. Each car is built to the buyer’s specification, so its owner would have been able to request the garish paint job from the beginning. The Phantom is a classic choice of car for the very wealthy, and they are all assembled by hand at the Rolls-Royce factory in Goodwood, West Sussex. A-list celebrities David Beckham, Simon Cowell, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone and Eddie Murphy have all been spotted riding in the car. It is also a favourite of the royal family and heads of state worldwide – an earlier version of the Phantom was presented to the Queen as a gift on her Silver Jubilee. However, the cars almost always appear in reserved shades of black, silver, cream or deep blue. The Phantom, a traditional symbol of wealth and sophistication, is usually seen in subtler colours (right) In marketing literature for the cars, Rolls-Royce invites potential buyers to: ‘discover the genuine authority and rare sense of scale and occasion’ the car offers. They cost around £250,000. But this over-the-top specimen is hardly an isolated site in London, increasingly the destination of choice for the monied Middle-Eastern elite looking for somewhere cooler than home. This summer an especially flashy menagerie of vehicles were seen on the streets of the capital – many parked illegally. High roller: The Kensington Phantom is not the only top of the range car spotted in London in a slightly unusual colour. This pale pink Roller has been spotted in Knightsbridge. This purple Lamborghini, pictured this summer outside the Dorchester Hotel in London, was another Arabic supercar set loose on the capital. But it was later seized by police because the driver did not have a licence or insurance documents. Ramadan racer: This Ferrari is bound to grab attention with its velvet-covered roof. The Metropolitan Police seized a £350,000 ‘glow-in-the-dark’ Lamborghini Aventador after its driver – believed to be a Qatari royal – was caught driving uninsured and without a licence. It was later displayed outside Scotland Yard, covered with police tape reading 'uninsured vehicle seized by police'. At the time a police spokesman said: 'We have had a few Porsches, BMW X5s, and a Ferrari – that one got crushed and in fact the vast majority of them are.' Police are known to have seized dozens of super cars across the capital over the last year on an array of charges including driving with invalid insurance and driving without proper registration plates. Last month, a £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador was pictured being towed away after the driver fell foul of the law - he was found to be driving without correct insurance. And a member of Qatar's Al-Thani dynasty has had two supercars towed away by police. The influx of foreign registered super cars to the UK was highlighted in a Channel 4 documentary earlier this year.

In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis.

Humans and other mammals have two hippocampi, one in each side of the brain. The hippocampus belongs to the limbic system and plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory, and in spatial memory that enables navigation. The hippocampus is located under the cerebral cortex (allocortical) and in primates in the medial temporal lobe. It contains two main interlocking parts: the hippocampus proper (also called Ammon's horn) and the dentate gyrus. Multi-choice problem: Is it true that is the hippocampus part of the brain stem? (A). no; (B). yes; The answer is:","output":"(A). no; The hippocampus is not part of the brain stem. The brain stem is a different part of the brain that controls basic body functions like heart rate and breathing. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system, which is involved in learning, memory, and emotions. So, the hippocampus and brain stem are different parts of the brain, each with their own functions."},{"instruction":"Thisimagebelongstothefollowingcategories:Weightlifting.

People responding to medications, Royal Caribbean says. Vessel undergoes sanitizing in San Juan, Puerto Rico. A CDC official will board the ship Sunday to investigate. Article:","output":"Title: CDC to Investigate Gastrointestinal Outbreak on Explorer of the Seas; Royal Caribbean Responds An outbreak of gastrointestinal problems has been reported on Royal Caribbean International's Explorer of the Seas cruise ship, affecting 281 passengers and 22 crew members. The cruise line has responded to the issue, stating that affected individuals are responding to medications and that the vessel is undergoing sanitization in San Juan, Puerto Rico. A CDC official is set to board the ship on Sunday to investigate the cause of the gastrointestinal outbreak and provide recommendations for preventing further incidents. The Explorer of the Seas, a popular cruise ship with a capacity of over 3,000 passengers, began experiencing issues when 281 passengers and 22 crew members reported gastrointestinal problems. The symptoms, which include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, have raised concerns among those on board. In response to the outbreak, Royal Caribbean has acted swiftly to address the issue and ensure the safety and health of all passengers and crew members on board. They have reported that those affected by the gastrointestinal issues are responding well to medications and are expected to recover shortly. As a precautionary measure, the Explorer of the Seas has been docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico for thorough sanitizing efforts. The cruise line is working closely with local health authorities and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to identify the cause of the outbreak and to establish appropriate measures for preventing future incidents. In their statement, Royal Caribbean emphasized their commitment to maintaining a safe and healthy environment for all passengers and crew: \\"Our primary concern is the wellbeing of our guests and crew, and we are working closely with our shipboard medical team, CDC, and local health authorities to ensure that optimal protocols are in place to protect all on board.\\" As part of the ongoing investigation, a CDC official will board the Explorer of the Seas on Sunday to assess the situation and provide recommendations for further action. The importance of identifying the source of the problem cannot be understated, as gastrointestinal outbreaks can spread rapidly in confined spaces such as cruise ships, posing significant threats to the health and safety of all on board. The incident on the Explorer of the Seas serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining strict hygiene standards and closely monitoring the health of passengers and crew members on cruise vessels. Cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean play a crucial role in safeguarding the wellbeing of their guests and employees by working closely with health authorities to ensure the rapid response to potential outbreaks and implementing preventive measures to avoid future occurrences. As the CDC investigates the cause of the gastrointestinal outbreak on Explorer of the Seas, the cruise ship industry will be paying close attention to the findings and recommendations released in the coming days. It is hoped that this incident will further reinforce the importance of stringent health and safety guidelines on board cruise ships and contribute to the continuous improvement in maintaining the well-being of passengers and crew members alike."},{"instruction":"Given the question: - A satellite&#x27;s need is determined - A group of people work to design a satellite capable of accomplishing the need - A team designs the physical structure of the satellite - A crew builds the physical satellite - The satellite is packed into a capsule - The satellite capsule is loaded onto a rocket What might be the last step of the process?

Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\". - CBS (an initialism of the network's former name, the Columbia Broadcasting System) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is a flagship property of CBS Corporation. The company is headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and operations in New York City (at the CBS Broadcast Center) and Los Angeles (at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center). - An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism. - Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. \\"Traditional folk music\\" has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - Columbia Records (also known simply as Columbia) is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME), a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, Inc., the United States division of Sony Corporation. It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990. It is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels alongside RCA Records and Epic Records. - The American folk-music revival was a phenomenon in the United States that began during the 1940s and peaked in popularity in the mid-1960s. Its roots went earlier, and performers like Josh White, Burl Ives, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Big Bill Broonzy, Richard Dyer-Bennet, Oscar Brand, Jean Ritchie, John Jacob Niles, Susan Reed, Paul Robeson and Cisco Houston had enjoyed a limited general popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. The revival brought forward styles of American folk music that had, in earlier times, contributed to the development of country and western, jazz, and rock and roll music. - Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services. These make Sony one of the most comprehensive entertainment companies in the world.

Sony is among the Semiconductor sales leaders by year and as of 2013, the fourth-largest television manufacturer in the world, after Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and TCL. - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts such as songwriter but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. - \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\" is a song written by Bob Dylan in the summer of 1962. It was first recorded in Columbia Records' Studio A on December 6, 1962 for his second album \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\". The lyrical structure is based on the question and answer form of traditional ballads such as Lord Randall. Dylan has stated that all of the lyrics were taken from the initial lines of songs that \\"he thought he would never have time to write.\\" - Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American songwriter, singer, artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when his songs chronicled social unrest. Early songs such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. - Highway 61 Revisited is the sixth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. It was released on August 30, 1965, by Columbia Records. Having until then recorded mostly acoustic music, Dylan used rock musicians as his backing band on every track of the album, except for the closing 11-minute ballad, \\"Desolation Row\\". Critics have focused on the innovative way in which Dylan combined driving, blues-based music with the subtlety of poetry to create songs that captured the political and cultural chaos of contemporary America. Author Michael Gray has argued that in an important sense the 1960s \\"started\\" with this album. - Rolling Stone is an American biweekly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. In recent years, it has resumed its traditional mix of content. - A protest song is a song that is associated with a movement for social change and hence part of the broader category of \\"topical\\" songs (or songs connected to current events). It may be folk, classical, or commercial in genre. - RCA Records is an American major record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME). It is one of SME's flagship record labels alongside sister labels Columbia Records and Epic Records. The label has released multiple genres of music, including pop, rock, hip hop, R&B, blues, jazz, and country. The company's name is derived from the initials of the label's former parent company, Radio Corporation of America (RCA). It is the second oldest recording company in U.S. history, after sister label Columbia Records. RCA's Canadian unit (formerly Berliner Gramophone Canada) is Sony's oldest label in Canada. It was one of only two Canadian record companies to survive the Great Depression. - \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" is a song written by Bob Dylan in 1962 and released as a single and on his album \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" in 1963. Although it has been described as a protest song, it poses a series of rhetorical questions about peace, war and freedom. The refrain \\"The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind\\" has been described as \\"impenetrably ambiguous: either the answer is so obvious it is right in your face, or the answer is as intangible as the wind\\". - A subsidiary, subsidiary company or daughter company is a company that is owned or controlled by another company, which is called the \\"parent company\\", \\"parent\\", or \\"holding company\\". The subsidiary can be a company, corporation, or limited liability company. In some cases it is a government or state-owned enterprise. - \`\` Gates of Eden '' is a song by Bob Dylan that appears on his fifth studio album Bringing It All Back Home , released on March 22 , 1965 by Columbia Records . It was also released as a single as the B - side of \`\` Like a Rolling Stone '' . Dylan plays the song solo , accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica . It is one of his more surreal songs . In a 2005 Mojo magazine poll of its writers and various well - known musicians , \`\` Gates of Eden '' was ranked 69th among Dylan 's 100 greatest songs . - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - EMI (officially EMI Group Limited, originally an initialism for Electric and Musical Industries and often known as EMI Records and EMI Music) was a British multinational conglomerate founded in March 1931 and was based in London. At the time of its break-up in 2012, it was the fourth-largest business group and family of record labels in the recording industry and was one of the big four record companies (now the big three). Its EMI Records Ltd. group of record labels included EMI Records, Parlophone, Virgin Records and Capitol Records. EMI also had a major publishing arm, EMI Music Publishingalso based in London with offices globally. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - American folk music is a musical term that encompasses numerous genres, many of which are known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and can sometimes be traced back to such places of origin as Great Britain, Europe, or Africa. Mike Seeger once famously commented that the definition of American folk music is \\"All the music that fits between the cracks.\\" - Epic Records is an American record company. A division of Sony Music Entertainment, Inc., Epic was founded predominantly as a jazz and classical music label in 1953. It later expanded its scope to include diverse musical genres including pop, R&B, rock and hip hop. Historically, the label has housed popular acts such as Boston, Celine Dion, Dave Clark Five, Gloria Estefan, Pearl Jam, Shakira, and Sly & the Family Stone. - Bringing It All Back Home is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on March 22, 1965 by Columbia Records. The album is divided into an electric and an acoustic side, although the acoustic side included some tracks in which other instruments were backing up Dylan and his guitar, but no drums were used. On side one of the original LP, Dylan is backed by an electric rock and roll banda move that further alienated him from some of his former peers in the folk music community. Likewise, on the acoustic second side of the album, he distanced himself from the protest songs with which he had become closely identified (such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\"), as his lyrics continued their trend towards the abstract and personal. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s.

The data also shows that the monitoring body set up in Riyadh purportedly to investigate incidents of civilian casualties has supported the Saudi military version of events in almost every case. The Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) has not issued comprehensive statistics but has instead issued periodic press statements. And according to an analysis by Human Rights Watch (HRW), out of 75 incidents where civilian casualties were reported, JIAT has admitted Saudi rules of engagement may have been broken in only two. 'The sound of children screaming keeps replaying': a Red Cross nurse in Yemen Read more In 10 more cases, JIAT has conceded that civilians may have been killed in error and said that compensation would be paid, but human rights advocates said there was so far no sign of any payments being made. “None of the victims’ families we reached out to said they had been contacted,” said Kristine Bekerle, a HRW researcher, noting that the cases where compensation had been promised were up to two years old. The 9 August airstrike obliterated a bus carrying schoolboys on a field trip in northern Yemen, leaving 40 children and 11 adults dead. The Saudi government told the UN security council that the strike would be investigated – but described it as “a legitimate military action”, saying it had targeted “Houthi leaders who were responsible for recruiting and training young children, and then sending them to battlefields”. The schoolboys had been on the way to a cemetery where rebels were buried but survivors told journalists that was because it was one of the very few green spaces left in the whole of the northern Saada governorate. Parks and gardens have been destroyed in the relentless fighting. “They came to the hospital in cars and ambulances. Dozens of children with an array of grisly wounds,” Marta Rivas Blanco, an ICRC nurse at the Al Talh hospital where the victims were taken, wrote in an account of the day for the Guardian. “Some were screaming, some were scared, many went straight to the morgue.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A Yemeni child receives medical treatment after he was injured by the airstrike on the school bus. Photograph: Mohammed Hamoud/Getty Images Statistics collated by an independent monitoring group, the Yemen Data Project, suggest that the targeting of the schoolbus was part of a wider pattern. According to its records, there have been 55 airstrikes against civilian vehicles and buses in the first seven months of this year – a higher rate than in 2017. The group’s analysis of over 18,000 strikes from March 2015 to April 2016 found that almost a third (31%) of the targets were non-military – civilians or civilian infrastructure – 36% were military, while another third were classified as having an unknown target. Bombed into famine: how Saudi air campaign targets Yemen’s food supplies Read more The coalition, whose other principal member is the United Arab Emirates, is under little international pressure to rein in its three-year bombing campaign and its stranglehold of trade routes. Its efforts to isolate rebel-held areas culminated in a June offensive on the port city of Hodeidah, the distribution point for 80% of the food, water and fuel supplies for 8 million Yemenis in severe need. The US defence secretary, James Mattis, said he had dispatched a three-star US general to Riyadh to look into the bus bombing. Meanwhile, a congressional defence spending bill signed by Donald Trump on Monday includes a clause requiring the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to certify that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are taking steps to prevent civilian deaths. Without such certification, the US would stop refuelling Saudi warplanes involved in the bombing campaign. But the attack on the schoolbus was not mentioned in a state department account of a subsequent phone conversation between Pompeo and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Trump has yet to refer to it at all. In the past, the US and UK governments – the coalition’s main arms suppliers – have pointed to the establishment of JIAT as evidence of an effort to reduce civilian casualties, and maintained their weapons sales. Saudi Arabia is the biggest single buyer of arms from both countries, accounting for about half the total UK and US sales, worth billions of dollars. In May, Reuters reported that the Trump administration had asked Congress to review the sale of 120,000 Raytheon guided missiles to Saudi Arabia and UAE. CNN reported on 17 August that fragments from the site of the schoolbus bombing were from a Lockheed Martin munition. The US, UK and France, the third biggest arms exporter to the Middle East, have shielded their Gulf allies from serious diplomatic pressure at the security council. When Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Peru and Bolivia called for an emergency security council meeting on Friday to discuss the bus bombing, they were not joined by any of the five permanent members, although the UK, which currently holds the council presidency, scheduled the meeting. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Yemeni children raise signs and chant slogans during a demonstration against the airstrike on the school bus. Photograph: Mohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty Images Kuwait, a member of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, used its seat on the council to block any strong language. There was no joint press statement at the end of the session, but merely “press elements”, a weaker expression of opinion, which watered down the call by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, for an “independent and prompt” investigation. The inquiry should be “credible and transparent”, the council members said, leaving open the possibility that the coalition members could investigate themselves. The UK’s response to the bus attack came in the form of a tweet posted by Alistair Burt, the Foreign Office minister for the Middle East, who said he was “deeply concerned” about reports of children’s deaths, but did not mention the attack was carried out by the Saudi-led coalition. Andrew Smith of the Campaign Against Arms Trade said “the complicit silence from No 10 is a clear case of arms company profits being put above human rights and Yemeni lives”. Critics of US and UK policy argue that by continuing to arm the coalition while accepting whitewashed Saudi accounts of the civilian deaths, the two countries risk becoming legally complicit in war crimes. “When the Saudi-led coalition’s investigative process basically says they are not responsible for ninety-something percent of these airstrikes hitting civilians, it calls into question the legitimacy of that process,” said Ted Lieu, a Democratic congressman from California. Dozens dead in Yemen as bus carrying children hit by airstrike Read more This week Lieu wrote to the acting inspector general at the Pentagon calling on him to launch an investigation over whether US service members providing support for coalition air operations, or US officials selling arms to Saudi Arabia, “could be responsible for aiding and abetting war crimes”. The congressman told the Guardian: “I believe both the US and United Kingdom and other governments providing support to the Saudi-led coalition could be liable for war crimes.” Fabian Hamilton, the UK’s shadow minister for peace and disarmament, said: “As a permanent member of the UN security council, the UK government’s response to this horrific attack has been abysmal. “Failing to take action now means the government is presiding over the worst man-made humanitarian disaster of the 21st century,” Hamilton said. “Britain is currently playing a part in arming the Saudi-led coalition to the teeth, as it continues to violate international law, targeting civilians and sources of international aid.” • This article was amended on 19 August 2018 to change attribution of fragments found at the site of the schoolbus bombing from a Raytheon munition to a Lockheed Martin munition. ||||| DAHYAN, Yemen — The boys crammed into the bus, their thin bodies packed three to a seat, with latecomers jammed in the aisle. They fidgeted with excitement about the day’s field trip, talking so loudly that a tall boy struggling to get their attention put his hands over his ears and yelled. Hours later, most of them were dead. During a stop for snacks in the poor village of Dahyan in northern Yemen, an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition of Arab nations hit nearby, blasting the bus into a jagged mass of twisted metal and scattering its human cargo — wounded, bleeding and dead — in the street below, according to witnesses and parents. “My leg is bent,” cried a young boy covered in blood, examining his damaged limb. “A jet hit us,” he said in a video taken at the scene after the airstrike. Yemeni health officials said 54 people were killed, 44 of them children, and many more were wounded. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In recent news, the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) has faced scrutiny over its role in monitoring civilian casualties during Saudi-led coalition airstrikes in Yemen. According to an analysis by Human Rights Watch, the JIAT has supported the Saudi military's version of events in the majority of cases; out of 75 incidents where civilian casualties were reported, the JIAT admitted that Saudi rules of engagement may have been broken in only two cases. As a result, there has been limited international pressure to rein in the Saudi-led coalition’s airstrikes and stranglehold of trade routes in Yemen, which has led to civilian infrastructure being targeted and humanitarian crisis in the region. The Yemen Data Project, an independent monitoring group, has also reported that over 18,000 airstrikes between March 2015 and April 2016 targeted non-military locations, creating a pattern of attacks on civilian vehicles and infrastructure. Critics argue that continuing to arm the coalition while accepting the Saudi accounts of the civilian deaths could make countries like the US and UK legally complicit in war crimes. In addition to limited accountability from JIAT, there is also concern about the lack of transparency regarding compensation promised to the families of civilian casualties, with human rights advocates indicating that no payments have been made.

Sentence 2: This was probably the best solution. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, as both sentences express similar sentiments and essentially imply the same idea. In both sentences, the speaker believes that a certain event or decision is favorable or the most appropriate course of action. Here is a detailed breakdown of each sentence: Sentence 1: \\"That was probably for the best.\\" In this sentence, the use of \\"that\\" indicates a specific event or decision. The phrase \\"for the best\\" means that the event or decision is considered to be the most beneficial or suitable choice. The use of \\"probably\\" implies some uncertainty, but the speaker conveys that they believe the event or decision is ultimately a positive one. Sentence 2: \\"This was probably the best solution.\\" In this sentence, the use of \\"this\\" also refers to a specific event or decision, just like \\"that\\" in Sentence 1. The phrase \\"the best solution\\" conveys that the event or decision is seen as the optimal choice. The use of \\"probably\\" once again introduces an element of uncertainty, but the speaker still conveys a belief that the decision or event is a favorable one. Although Sentence 2 uses the term \\"solution\\" and Sentence 1 uses the phrase \\"for the best,\\" they both refer to the idea that an event or decision is the most favorable choice in a particular situation.

Would \\"David is central to Jewish , Christian , and Islamic doctrine and culture.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","output":"No, the statement \\"David is central to Jewish, Christian, and Islamic doctrine and culture\\" does not address the question about David's diet from the Bible. To provide a more detailed and long answer to the question, let us examine what information we can gather from the biblical texts and historical context about David's diet. David, the second king of Israel, lived around 1040 - 970 BC. As the Bible does not lay out a specific diet for David, we can deduce what his diet might have included based on the traditional foods available in the region and time period, as well as biblical principles. Dietary laws for the Israelites can be found in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. As David was a follower of these laws, his diet would have been based on the kosher guidelines. These guidelines specify permitted and prohibited foods, as well as proper preparation and consumption methods. Based on historical context and the landscape of ancient Israel, here are several food items that likely constituted David's diet: 1. Grains: The primary grains cultivated in ancient Israel were barley and wheat. Bread was a staple food, so David would have eaten bread made from these grains regularly. 2. Fruits and vegetables: The fertile lands of ancient Israel produced a variety of fruits and vegetables. Some common types of fruits available at that time included grapes, figs, pomegranates, and olives. Vegetables such as cucumbers, onions, and leeks were also grown. David would have had access to these fruits and vegetables in his diet. 3. Legumes: Beans and lentils were an essential part of the ancient Israelite diet because they served as a significant source of protein. Since they were easily grown and stored, it is likely that David included legumes in his diet. 4. Nuts and seeds: Almonds, pistachios, and walnuts were commonly consumed in ancient Israel and would have been part of David's diet. 5. Dairy: Dairy products such as cheese, yogurt, and milk were often consumed by the Israelites. As an example, when David encountered King Saul at the cave in En Gedi, he was offered curds, which is a dairy product (1 Samuel 17:18). 6. Meat: Due to the dietary laws, David only consumed meat from specific clean animals, like cattle, sheep, and goats. Consumption of meat was usually reserved for special occasions and sacred feasts, such as the Passover meal. Fish with fins and scales, such as tilapia, were also permitted. 7. Wine and vinegar: The Israelites consumed wine moderately, and it was a common drink during feasts and celebrations. Wine was often diluted with water, and vinegar was sometimes added to enhance the flavor. 8. Honey: Honey was a natural sweetener used in preparing various dishes and was considered a luxury item in ancient Israel. In conclusion, although the Bible does not provide detailed information about King David's diet, we can assume that it consisted of grains, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, legumes, dairy, meats, wine, and honey. David would have adhered to the dietary laws found in Leviticus and Deuteronomy and consumed a wholesome, balanced diet based on the local produce and cultural practices of ancient Israel."},{"instruction":"Given the question: This article: Gabe Ryan is released from reform school and it taken to a new house by his sister Joy to start a new life where no one knows of his past.

Step 2: Determine if both questions are inquiring about the same information: These two questions are not exactly inquiring about the same information. The first question is asking about the specific meaning of the expression 'irony of ironies,' which is a superlative form of irony used to emphasize an extremely ironic situation. The second question is asking for the general definition of 'irony,' which is a figure of speech or situation where there is a contrast between expectation and reality. Both questions are related to the topic of irony, but each has a slightly different focus. The first question seeks understanding about a specific expression involving irony, while the second question is about the broader concept of irony itself."},{"instruction":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I bought this for my twins when they were just 2 & it has been nothing but trouble. Like the rest have said, it's too difficult for them to use on their own until at least age three(then the stories/activities are too immature). Now if one child uses it, the others come & want to press the buttons. So frequently they aren't getting anything out of it since there is no cause & effect since three kids are pressing who know what at what time. Then often they somehow get on the wrong page & nothing makes sense. My take is: when I spend time with my kids. it will be reading them a book, not trying to fend off three sets of little hands all wanting to push buttons at the same time.

No Based on the review provided, it seems that the user would not recommend this product. The user faced multiple issues while using the product with their twins, such as difficulty in operating the product until the children reach the age of three, problem in managing multiple kids using it simultaneously, and the lack of desired cause and effect due to children pressing random buttons. The user has expressed a preference for spending time with their children by reading them a book instead of struggling with the product. They mentioned that their brother, who has just one child, found the product enjoyable, but this doesn't change the user's overall negative experience with the item. As a result, the user would likely not recommend this product, especially for families with more than one child around the same age."},{"instruction":"In this task you are given a small conversation between two persons and 4 options on how the conversation should continue.

The golden mosaics in the mihrab and the central dome of the Great Mosque in Corduba have a decidedly Byzantine character. They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen, supervised by a master mosaicist from Constantinople, who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain.

Article: The Lunar New Year, which starts in late January this year, is the most important festival for Chinese people as most of them drop any business at hand to go back to their hometown to see their families. It is a tradition that has been cherished since ancient times, but as social mobility increases in modern times, the road to family reunions has become very uneasy. It is not the higher travel costs, nor the expected big spending on gifts and other festival items, but the train ticket that has driven many travelers mad. I've heard some colleagues complain that they have tried every means to secure a train ticket, only to find it a mission impossible. Some of them have turned to the latest software to aid online booking; others have sought help from friends to increase the possibility of successful booking. No doubt chunyun, the Spring Festival travel season, is the largest-scale annual human migration in the world. Last year, 220 million passengers traveled by train during the Spring Festival season, which usually lasts 40 days. It is a huge jump from 10 years ago, when the number was 128 million. With the big sudden increase in demand, the railway company has increased investment in railway construction; still, it cannot bridge the supply gap, leading to fierce public complaints and criticism. Admittedly, it is almost impossible for the railway company to suddenly improve its capacity to meet the explosive demand during the Spring Festival holiday. Moreover, any temporary increase in capacity would become unnecessary after the holiday and mean great commercial losses during the off season. What the company can reasonably do is gradually improve its capacity while focusing on better distribution of its existing resources during the special peak season. At any rate, however, the problem cannot be solved overnight. Question: What's the tone of the whole passage? Options: A: Optimistic.

Review: On the box of this dual dvd set, one is lead to believe this is a comprehensive history of firearms from their humble and primitive beginnings to the sophisticated weapons of today. Not quite.What we have here are really a series of crude, amateurish and recycled US Army training films from the early 1980's that are as engaging as old reruns from the \\"A-Team\\". A few of the segments are vintage WWII training films in color, like \\"Meet the Enemy,\\" a 20 minute army training film on German battle tactics in the field. But this is not enough to recommend this set. I purchased my set for 4.99 at Ross-Dress For Less than the 9.99 list price here on Amazon. Nonetheless, even a two star rating is too generous for this dvd set. Answer:","output":"Based on the review, it can be inferred that the customer was dissatisfied with the product, which is a dual DVD set covering the history of firearms. The main indicators of this dissatisfaction can be seen in both the title of the review that mentions 'disappointment' and 'misleading' and the detailed comments provided by the customer. First, the customer feels misled by the box of the product. From the description, the product was marketed as providing a comprehensive history of firearms but fell short of the expectations the customer had based on this. This falls into a form of dissatisfaction since the contents of the product did not meet the customer's perceived value and what was promised. Secondly, the customer described the DVDs as containing 'crude, amateurish and recycled US Army training films from the early 1980s.' This is an indication of dissatisfaction with the quality of the content in the DVDs, perceived as poor quality or outdated. This sentiment is further emphasized by the customer's comparison of the videos to 'old reruns from the \\"A-Team\\"', a televised series from the early 1980s, which likely implies that the customer found the material as being irrelevant or dull. Next, the customer mentioned that while there were some vintage WWII training films included, these were not enough to improve his opinion or recommend the set to others. This suggests that the customer didn't find the offering worth purchasing despite some unique content. Finally, the pricing aspect also indicates dissatisfaction. The customer bought the DVD set at a discounted price but still perceived the 4.99 paid as not offering value for money and considered the product overpriced for the quality and content provided. On a rating scale, the customer acknowledges that even a two-star rating is rather generous for the DVD set, which further emphasizes the level of dissatisfaction with the purchase. Therefore, considering these factors, the reviewer is clearly unsatisfied with the product."},{"instruction":"In this task, you need to answer the given multiple-choice question on the gain.

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that?

If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"Answer: Directly impacting a step of the process. When the process of body cooling is repeated more frequently, it implies that there is continuous heat exposure or a high level of physical activity. If one or more steps in the process are directly impacted, it could lead to less effective body cooling, which could be the result of the supposed perturbation. For example, if there is a direct impact on the blood vessels' ability to dilate properly, it would prevent the body from releasing heat effectively. If the sweat glands are not producing enough sweat or if the moisture is not evaporating efficiently, the cooling effect will be reduced. An indirect impact on the process would involve factors that do not have a direct connection to any specific step but could still influence the overall cooling efficiency, such as the surrounding environment, humidity, or the individual's hydration level. Not impacting any step of the process would mean that the perturbation has no bearing on the body cooling mechanism, and the process itself remains unaffected."},{"instruction":"The Australia national cricket team toured England from May to September 1912 and took part in the 1912 Triangular Tournament, playing three Test matches each against the England national cricket team and the South Africa national cricket team.

The battle took place on June 23-24, 1314, as part of the First War of Scottish Independence between the Scottish forces led by King Robert the Bruce and the English forces led by King Edward II. Stirling is a historically significant town and played a key role in the history of Scotland due to its strategic position. Located at the convergence of the River Forth and the River Teith, Stirling was considered the \\"Gateway to the Highlands\\" and was a crucial site for controlling access to the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland. As such, it was a highly contested area. The Battle of Bannockburn was a pivotal moment in Scotland's fight for independence from English rule. The Scottish forces, led by Robert the Bruce, were vastly outnumbered by the English, but they were able to outmaneuver them and achieve a decisive victory. This victory provided a substantial boost to Scottish morale and became a symbol of Scottish resistance against English domination. The site of the battle today is a place of immense historical and cultural significance. It is home to the Bannockburn Visitor Centre, which offers a detailed and immersive experience of the battle and its wider context within Scottish history. The Battle of Bannockburn site also features a memorial statue of Robert the Bruce, symbolizing his crucial role in the fight for Scottish independence. In summary, the site of the Battle of Bannockburn is close to the town of Stirling, a strategically important location in central Scotland.

In the phrase \\"pointed, often tender,\\" both words have relatively positive connotations. \\"Pointed\\" can be seen as a positive in the context of a movie review because it often refers to clear, powerful and well-delivered elements of a movie, either in terms of its plot, character development, or dialogue. A pointed performance, for example, would refer to an actor delivering a performance with precision, hitting exactly the right notes of emotion. On a general level, it might mean that the film has well-articulated messages or themes, making a clear impact on an audience. Therefore, it is sometimes associated with efficacy, strength, and clarity, which are typically viewed as positive attributes in a movie. \\"Tender\\" is more directly positive, often used to describe scenes that are gentle, touching, or emotionally effective. When used in a movie review, it typically refers to scenes or performances that are emotionally resonant or bring out soft, affectionate feelings from the audience. It is often related to emotive storytelling or performances, which are also usually considered as positive traits for a movie.

To prevent perpetrators from claiming they never heard a definite \\"no\\" from their victims, the bill now calls for an \\"affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity.\\" The legislation is meant to protect individuals who are drunk, drugged, asleep, or unconscious, the AP reports; it notes consent can be nonverbal (ie, a nod of the head). The bill adds that colleges and universities have to come up with a blueprint to help sexual assault victims, make counseling and health services available, and better train faculty who review such cases. \\"This is amazing,\\" says a UCLA student. \\"It's going to educate an entire new generation of students on what consent is and what consent is not ... that the absence of a 'no' is not a 'yes.'\\" Also signed by Brown over the weekend: a bill that offers college loans to students in the US illegally, and a bill that will ask voters whether to repeal parts of a 1998 law that mandate school instruction be in English. (Some people aren't happy with the way Florida State has handled its sexual assault cases.)","output":"Title: California Leads the Way in Strengthening Sexual Assault Prevention on Campus In an effort to combat sexual assault on college campuses, California Gov. Jerry Brown recently signed several bills aimed at helping students across the state. The most notable among these is Senate Bill 967 (SB-967), which has placed California as the first state to implement an \\"affirmative consent\\" mandate for colleges and universities. This groundbreaking legislation has the potential to reshape how sexual assault cases are handled on campus and protect an entire generation of students. The traditional \\"no means no\\" mantra is axed by SB-967, and instead, colleges and universities will now need to adopt a standard of \\"clear consent\\" when it comes to students' sexual activity, reports the Los Angeles Times. This transformation is an essential step towards mitigating sexual assault on campuses across the state and establishing a safer environment for all students. To prevent perpetrators from claiming that they never heard a definite \\"no\\" from their victims, the bill now requires that \\"an affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity\\" be demonstrated by all parties. This legislation is intended to protect individuals who may be intoxicated, drugged, asleep, or unconscious. It is noteworthy that consent can be nonverbal, such as through a nod of the head. In addition to requiring clear consent, SB-967 proposes that all colleges and universities in the state devise a blueprint to assist victims of sexual assault. This includes providing access to counseling and health services, as well as improving the training of faculty who review such cases. The overall aim of the bill is to create a more supportive ecosystem for sexual assault victims, ensuring that their voices are heard and that they receive the necessary resources to heal and move forward. A UCLA student was quoted as saying, \\"This is amazing. It's going to educate an entire new generation of students on what consent is and what consent is not...that the absence of a 'no' is not a 'yes.'\\" With California leading the way on this crucial issue, it is hoped that other states will follow suit and adopt similar legislation to better protect students on college campuses nationwide. Other bills signed by Gov. Jerry Brown during a busy weekend included a bill offering college loans to students who are undocumented and living in the US, as well as a bill proposing a vote on whether to repeal parts of a 1998 law mandating that school instruction be in English. Given the attention that sexual assault cases have received – including the criticism faced by Florida State University for its handling of such incidents – it is crucial that robust efforts are made in preventing and addressing these crimes on campus. With the passage of SB-967, California has taken a significant step forward in ensuring the safety and well-being of its college students."},{"instruction":"Come up with a question and stream of consciousness reasoning that would justify this answer: water fountain","output":"Question: What type of feature could be added to a public park to provide easy access to drinking water for park visitors? Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: When considering the needs of park visitors, it is crucial to address their access to drinking water. Especially during hot summer days or after engaging in recreational activities, hydration becomes a priority for visitors. Installing a water fountain seems to be a practical solution. Water fountains are designed to provide clean and free drinking water to the public, which promotes eco-friendliness by reducing the usage of disposable plastic bottles. Furthermore, water fountains can also serve as decorative elements in a park, enhancing its aesthetic appeal. Thus, a water fountain would be an excellent addition to a public park to provide easy access to drinking water for park visitors while promoting environmental sustainability and aesthetic value."},{"instruction":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

What is the answer??","output":"Let's solve the problem step by step like we're talking to a five-year-old! We have a math problem: 9*c - 92*c - 432 = -11*c. Imagine you have 9 apples, and then somebody takes away 92 apples. How many apples do you have? Well, first, we must subtract 9 - 92. That gives us -83. So now, we have -83 apples. Now we get back to our problem: -83*c - 432 = -11*c. Let's say those apples are magical and can multiply themselves with a number (c times). So, we have -83 multiplied by the magical number (c) and then 432 is taken away. Now, let's say you also have 11 more apples that are multiplying by the same magical number (c). To solve this, all we have to do is find out what the magical number (c) is! So first, let's get rid of the -11*c. To do that, let's add 11*c to both sides of the equation. -83*c + 11*c = -11*c + 11*c. This simplifies to: -72*c = 432. Now, we need to find out what the magical number (c) is. Let's divide each side by -72: -72*c / -72 = 432 / -72. This simplifies to: c = -6. So our answer is that the magical number (c) is equal to -6."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice question: What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

Yes, I can help the two individuals choose appropriate clothes. Here's a detailed guide on how to choose the right clothing items for different occasions and personal styles. 1. Determine the occasion or event: First, you need to identify the event or occasion for which the two individuals need to choose clothes. Is it a casual outing, a formal event, a business setting, or a themed party? 2. Consider personal style and preferences: To help each person feel comfortable and confident in their choice of clothing, it is crucial to consider their unique personal style and preferences. This may involve taking into account their favorite colors, patterns, cuts, and fabrics. 3. Evaluate body type and comfort: Assessing each individual's body type is essential for selecting clothes that emphasize their assets and make them feel comfortable. Opt for silhouettes and cuts that best flatter their particular body type, keeping in mind factors such as height, curves, and proportions. 4. Factor in the weather and location: Always remember to consider the weather and location of the event or occasion when helping to choose appropriate clothes. For instance, pick lighter fabrics for warmer environments, and opt for heavier garments in colder weather. Similarly, select clothing items that comply with any location-specific dress codes or cultural norms. 5. Select the right color palette: Consider the best colors for each individual based on their skin tone, hair color, and eye color. Typically, people with cool undertones look better in cool colors (blues, greens, and purples), while those with warm undertones look great in warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows). 6. Look for timeless, versatile pieces: Invest in high-quality clothing items that can be paired with different garments to create multiple stylish outfits. These versatile pieces include a well-fitted blazer, a classic white shirt, a pair of jeans, and a little black dress. 7. Accessorize wisely: Complete each outfit with suitable accessories like jewelry, shoes, belts, bags, and more. Make sure the chosen accessories complement the overall look, without overpowering it. 8. Fit is key: No matter how appealing a garment may seem, always ensure that it fits well on each individual. Clothes that are too tight or too loose can ruin the entire look and create discomfort. 9. Ensure proper grooming: The chosen outfits will only look their best when both individuals are well-groomed. This includes taking care of hair, makeup, and personal hygiene. 10. Seek advice and criticism: Ask a trusted friend or family member for their opinion on the chosen outfits. Constructive criticism can help fine-tune the selected clothes and make sure that the final outfit is perfect for the occasion. By following these guidelines, you can help the two individuals choose appropriate clothes that not only suit the occasion but also reflect their personal style and preferences, making them feel confident and comfortable."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Scotland recorded their first win of the ICC Women's World Cup Qualifier tournament with a seven-run victory over Papua New Guinea.

Run the apple under clean water, turning it as necessary to remove any dirt and debris. Remove the skin with a pairing knife or vegetable peeler. Options are: -- Use either a knife or vegetable peeler to gently peel the skin off the apple. Try to remove only a thin layer of skin and keep most of the apple intact. -- Use a shallow cutting knife to cut away the skin near the nape of the apple. Heat the base vegetable roux to 350 ° f (177 ° c). -- Washing apples removes some of the outer flesh in the apples, making it easier to cut. If you don't have a pair of cutting knives, use a paring knife, plastic spoon, or pie plate to peel your apples. -- Scrubbing the apples gently with a vegetable peeler will expose the skin. If you don't have any vegetable peeler, use a bread grater to remove the skin at the base of the apple.","output":"After washing and peeling the apples, the most logical next step would be to core and slice the apples for stewing. Here's a detailed explanation: 1. Core the apples: -- Use an apple corer or a sharp knife to remove the core from each apple. Place the apple on a cutting board and push the corer or knife into the center of the apple, starting at the stem end and going through the bottom. Twist the corer slightly and pull it back through the apple, bringing the core with it. If you don't have an apple corer, you can use a sharp knife to cut around the core by cutting the apple into quarters first and then removing the core section from each quarter. 2. Slice the apples: -- Once the core has been removed, slice the apples. Cut each apple into even slices – about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick – depending on your preference. Thinner slices will cook faster and become softer, while thicker slices will retain more of their shape and texture as they cook. Ensure all the slices are of similar thickness for even cooking. 3. Place the apple slices in a pot or large saucepan: -- Select a pot or saucepan with enough space to hold all the apple slices and accommodate the liquid they will release during cooking. Arrange the apple slices in the pot, spreading them evenly. 4. Add sweetener, spices, and liquid: -- Add your desired sweetener to taste, such as sugar, honey, or maple syrup. Then, add your preferred spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or cloves, according to your preference. To prevent the apples from sticking to the pot and to enhance flavor, add a small amount of liquid – water, apple juice, or cider all work well. Start with just a couple of tablespoons to avoid making the apples too watery, adding more as needed during cooking. 5. Cook the apple slices until tender: -- Heat the pot or saucepan over medium-low heat, allowing the apples to cook slowly and release their natural juices. Stir the apples occasionally to ensure even cooking. Cook the apples for 15-30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the slices and your desired level of tenderness. 6. Adjust seasonings and serve: -- Taste the stewed apples and adjust the sweetener and spices as needed. Once the apples are cooked to your desired tenderness, remove them from the heat. You can serve the stewed apples warm or chilled, as a side dish, dessert, or topping for other dishes such as oatmeal, pancakes, or ice cream."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. Chloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline previously used in malaria therapy and now becoming an emerging investigational antiviral drug due to its broad spectrum of antiviral activities. To explore whether the low pH-dependency of influenza A viruses might affect the antiviral effects of chloroquine at clinically achievable concentrations, we tested the antiviral effects of this drug on selected human and avian viruses belonging to different subtypes and displaying different pH requirements. Results showed a correlation between the responses to chloroquine and NH 4 Cl, a lysosomotropic agent known to increase the pH of intracellular vesicles. Time-of-addition experiments showed that the inhibitory effect of chloroquine was maximal when the drug had been added at the time of infection and was lost after 2 h post-infection. This timing approximately corresponds to that of virus/cell fusion. Moreover, there was a clear correlation between the EC 50 of chloroquine in vitro and the electrostatic potential of the HA subunit (HA2) mediating the virus/ cell fusion process. Overall, the present study highlights the critical importance of a host cell factor such as intravesicular pH in determining the anti-influenza activity of chloroquine and other lysosomotropic agents.

The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African fish eagle (H. vocifer) (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.

GRANTSVILLE — One man died Saturday night after witnesses say he ran into a ceremonial bonfire at a regional burning festival Saturday night. The annual event, put on by Element 11, is a spinoff of the Burning Man festival held in Black Rock City, Nevada. As part of the event, several effigies about 30 feet tall are constructed out of dry wood and ceremoniously burned, according to Element 11 spokesman J.P. Bernier. Because the burning produces extreme heat, volunteers form a perimeter around the burning for the safety of other participants, Bernier said. After 11 p.m., volunteers noticed a man who came running forward through the crowd and went past the perimeter. Volunteers made attempts to call out and stop the man, but they were unsuccessful in preventing him from jumping into the fire, Bernier said. \\"The nature of the fire is such that our volunteers were not able to get close enough to the fire for risk of their own safety,\\" Bernier said. \\"He was very fast; he was very motivated. It wasn't an accident or any act of negligence on anybody's part. He had a very deliberate objective to get past our volunteers, past our safety perimeter.\\" The victim's name was not released Sunday. Grantsville police issued a very brief statement only saying that they were investigating \\"a fatality at an event being held within Grantsville City.\\" Many participants were distraught and confused by the suddenness of the incident, according to a participant and a documentary photographer named Christian, who declined to provide his last name. \\"I did see that a lot of the community was shocked and traumatized,\\" he said. \\"There's a lot of questions, a lot of facts that are unknown.\\" Doug Johnson said the incident was the first of its kind that he's seen after attending the event for more than a dozen years. \\"I was blown away,\\" Johnson said. \\"Fifteen years and I've never had anything like that happen, ever.\\" More than 100 volunteers help facilitate the regional event, which is intended to \\"ignite a culture of creativity in the community,\\" Bernier said. The event hosted more than 1,200 attendees, and members of the volunteer Grantsville Fire Department were present. A burning scheduled for Sunday morning was canceled after Saturday's incident. Christian said safety has been an ever-growing priority at the event over the five years he's been attending. \\"This is the first event that I was restricted as a documentary photographer to ever get near anything there because safety was such a concern,\\" he said. \\"And the fact that he had to break through that barrier anyway, I would just say that it was not something that was easily prevented at all.\\" Bernier said that while safety procedures were followed, policies will be examined in the hope that such incidents will be prevented in the future. \\"We'll definitely look at our policies,\\" Bernier said.

A joyous festival was cut tragically short Saturday night when a man burned to death after leaping into a huge ceremonial bonfire. As a three-story wooden effigy, inspired by the creatures from Where the Wild Things Are, burned to mark the culmination of the Element 11 festival in Grantsville, hundreds of festival-goers watched in horror as Christopher Wallace of Salt Lake City broke through a safety barrier, danced wildly for a few moments and ran full speed into the flames. \\"He looked like he was having a great time. He was running out there. He was dancing a little bit,\\" witness Daisy McDonald told KUTV. \\"All of a sudden he jumped into the fire. It’s like he didn’t even know it was fire.

Witnesses said they saw Wallace’s hand rise up from the flames as he died. \\"The whole time I was thinking, ‘He’s gonna walk out. He’s gonna be okay,’ \\" McDonald said. \\"I thought he was gonna survive.\\" Wallace, who was in his late 20s or early 30s, had told other festival-goers earlier in the day that he planned to kill himself by jumping into the burning effigy, said Grantsville police Lt. Steve Barrett. \\"This is what he was going to do, and it’s what he did,\\" Barrett said, adding that neither security rangers nor firemen could have prevented Wallace from killing himself. \\"It took not even seconds. He was just through the barricades and into the fire.\\" Grantsville police reviewed video footage recorded by witnesses before determining that Wallace’s death was a suicide. The effigy had been burning for about 30 minutes when Wallace leapt into the fire at about about 11 p.m. Saturday, said Grantsville police Lt. Steve Barrett. Firefighters on scene tried to extinguish the flames but could not save Wallace. \\"It was shocking to everybody,\\" said Grantsville Mayor Brent Marshall, who did not witness the burn but visits the event site each year to perform a safety inspection. Marshall expressed his sympathy not only for the family of the dead man but also for the people who witnessed the suicide. \\"Horrific things get embedded into people’s minds,\\" Marshall said. \\"It’s a tragedy any way you want to look at it.\\" story continues below story continues below Element 11, or E-11 for short, is a so-called \\"regional burn,\\" one of dozens of smaller-scale events affiliated with the Burning Man arts and culture festival that takes place in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert every August.

Scientists from the University of Chile have spent a year designing the drug in a bid to tackle the growing problem of alcoholism in the country. The vaccine, which would be effective for between six months and a year, works by sending a biochemical message to the liver telling it not to express genes that metabolise alcohol. Normally, the liver turns alcohol into the hangover-causing compound called acetaldehyde which is then broken down by a metabolising enzyme. If someone who’s been vaccinated tries to drink alcohol, they will immediately experience severe nausea, accelerated heartbeat, and general discomfort. Once the vaccine has been administered it cannot be reversed. A preclinical trial using mice to determine the correct dosing is due to begin next month with researchers hoping to begin tests on human subjects in November. The vaccine, which would be effective for between six months and a year, works by sending a biochemical message to the liver telling it not to express genes that metabolise alcohol Dr. Juan Asenjo, director of the university's Institute for Cell Dynamics and Biotechnology said while the vaccine is not a cure-all, it could provide an important first step. He told the Santiago Times newspaper: 'People who end up alcoholic have a social problem; a personality problem because they’re shy, whatever, and then they are depressed, so it’s not so simple. Clanger: The hangover vaccine would be effective for between six months and a year 'But if we can solve the chemical, the basic part of the problem, I think it could help quite a bit. 'In Chile, according to the most recent 2011 study from the World Health Organization, one in 15 men have an alcohol use disorder. Dr Asenjo belives the vaccine has the potential to help millions of people worldwide. He added: 'If it works, it’s going to have a worldwide impact, but with many vaccines one has to test them carefully. I think the chances that this one will work are quite high.' Inspiration for the vaccine came from the far East, said Asenjo, where between 15 and 20 pwer cent of Japanese, Chinese or Koreans have a mutation which inhibits the breakdown of alcohol in their bodies. The idea of using drugs to combat alcoholism is not new. Disulfiram, which was developed almost a century ago works in a similar way blocking the enzyme from breaking down alcohol, thus intensifying the body’s negative response. However users often find the effects so unpleasant they simply stop taking the pills. ||||| Splitting headaches and waves of nausea – a drinker’s worst enemy – may soon provide alcoholics with an unlikely rescue from a crippling addiction.

His father, Bobby, was a long-time professional hockey player in both the National Hockey League (NHL) and World Hockey Association (WHA). His mother, Joanne (McKay), was an American professional figure skater and taught him how to skate. He has three brothers: Bobby Jr., Blake and Bart, and a younger sister: Michelle. Hull worked two jobs in 2006-07. He served as a special assistant to the team president of the Dallas Stars and provided studio analysis for NHL on NBC telecasts. He left NBC after one season when he was named a special adviser to the team's hockey operations department. Hull was promoted to interim co-general manager of the Stars, sharing the role with Les Jackson after Doug Armstrong was fired on November 13, 2007. ESPN analyst Scott Burnside criticized the promotion of Hull, noting his lack of front office experience and questionable work ethic. The pair made one of the most prominent trades in the 2007-08 NHL season, acquiring Brad Richards from the Tampa Bay Lightning as part of a five-player trade. The team went on to reach the Western Conference Final of the 2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Stars' deepest playoff run in eight years. Team owner Tom Hicks rewarded the pair with three-year contracts and named them permanent co-general managers. He credited Hull for his positive relationship with the players and his \\"unconventional wisdom\\". The signing of controversial forward Sean Avery prior to the 2008-09 season proved a turning point for Hull and Jackson. Avery's erratic behavior created divisions within the team's locker room, particularly after he made derogatory comments towards another player's girlfriend in the media. The Stars missed the playoffs that season, leading the team to replace Hull and Jackson as general manager with Joe Nieuwendyk. Hull remained with the organization, serving as an adviser to Hicks and team president Jeff Cogen.

He knew something fun was about to happen. My brother Sam and I carried the boxes out to his truck. The truck was red, shiny, and had really big wheels. It reminded me of the firetrucks you see in your cartoons! We carefully loaded the boxes in the back of the truck and made sure they were safely stacked like a big block tower. Once the truck was filled with all our boxes and furniture, we hopped into the front seat – me, Sam, and Sparky – and we buckled our seatbelts, just like you do when we go for a car ride. With a big smile, Sam turned the key, and the truck rumbled to life like a friendly giant. As we drove through the neighborhood, our friends and neighbors waved goodbye to us with big smiles, and we waved back at them. Sparky excitedly barked out the window, happy to see all the friendly faces. The ride to our new home wasn't very long, just like when we go to visit Grandma's house. When we arrived, the new house looked so big, just like a castle! It had a lovely big yard for Sparky to run around in, lots of space for your toys, and a big, comfy bedroom for you to sleep in.

Know how you're getting to the concert. Ride with a reliable and safe person. Ask an older sibling to go with you.","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Introducing Your Parents to Your Concert Companions and Ensuring a Safe Experience Introduction Attending a concert is a thrilling experience, whether it is your first time or a regular occurrence. It is an opportunity to create incredible memories that will last a lifetime, bond with our friends, and enjoy our favorite artists' live performances. However, as exhilarating as it is, it also comes with its risks and potential for hazards. This article aims to provide a step-by-step guide on how to introduce your parents to your concert-going friends, arranging safe transportation to the event, and potentially involving an older sibling to ensure a smooth and secure experience. 1. Introducing Your Parents to Your Concert Companions Parents worry about their children's safety, especially in situations where large crowds or potential dangers might arise. As such, it is crucial to reassure them by introducing them to the friends you will be attending the concert with. Here's how: - Arrange a Pre-Concert Gathering: Host a casual get-together at your home a few days before the concert, providing an opportunity for your parents to familiarize themselves with your friends. This can be as simple as a movie night, dinner party, or a game night. Ensure that all friends attending the concert are invited so that your parents can gauge the group's dynamics and develop trust. - Create an Informal Introduction: During the gathering, introduce each friend individually to your parents, along with their interests and hobbies. This will create a personal connection and help them understand who will be a part of your group at the concert. - Encourage Dialogue: Facilitate conversations between your parents and friends, encouraging them to share stories and experiences, like previous concerts they have attended together. This will reassure your parents that they are experienced and will look out for one another during the event. 2. Arranging Safe Transportation One of the primary concerns parents may have is how their child will travel to and from the concert. Ensuring safe and reliable transportation is crucial to alleviate any parental anxieties. Some measures to consider are: - Research Public Transportation: Look up bus schedules, train times, and routes to the concert venue, if feasible. Present this information to your parents, letting them know that this option is available and properly researched. - Arrange a Carpool with a Trustworthy Driver: If one of your friends has a valid driver's license and is responsible, suggest a carpool as your mode of transportation. Your parents should meet this friend and become familiar with their driving history before entrusting them with your safety. - Consider a Ride-Hailing Service: If neither public transport nor carpooling are viable options, consider using a reliable ride-hailing service like Uber or Lyft. Share the trip details, including the driver's name and vehicle information, with your parents. Moreover, use a tracking app, such as Life360 or a simple \\"Share My Location\\" feature, as added reassurance that they can monitor your whereabouts. 3. Involving an Older Sibling Sometimes, having an older sibling attend the concert with your group can provide an additional layer of security and increased peace of mind for your parents. Here's how: - Discuss the Idea with Your Sibling: Talk to your older sibling about attending the concert with you, ensuring that they are comfortable with the idea and enjoy the artist's music as well. - Establish Responsibilities: Clarify that your sibling will be there to not only enjoy the concert but also keep an eye on the group, ensuring everyone's safety. - Introduce Your Sibling to Your Friends: If your sibling is not acquainted with your friends, arrange a meeting beforehand, allowing them to become familiar with each other. This will ensure a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for all involved. Conclusion Attending concerts can provide unforgettable memories, but it is essential to address the understandable concerns of our parents. Introducing them to your concert companions, arranging safe and reliable transportation, and including an older sibling can significantly ease their worries, allowing them to trust you and your friends to enjoy a safe and memorable concert experience."},{"instruction":"Write some highlights for the following article: Phil Mickelson could get his wish after Paul Azinger said on Monday he was open to a second spell as US Ryder Cup captain. Mickelson caused controversy on Sunday when, within two hours of the United States suffering a third straight defeat in the biennial contest, he criticised the approach of captain Tom Watson. With Watson sitting just a few feet away, Mickelson - who had been left out of a full day's play on Saturday for the first time in 10 Ryder Cup appearances - stated his support for the methods of Azinger, who captained the side to their last win at Valhalla in 2008. Phil Mickelson (left) alongside Tom Watson, who he criticised swiftly after the conclusion of the Ryder Cup. Tom Watson's (pictured) captaincy produced a 16½ - 11½ loss for the USA. Phil Mickelson plays out of a bunker on the 17th hole at Gleneagles, Scotland on Sunday. 'Unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three Ryder Cups and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best,' Mickelson said. Asked if he would captain the side again, Azinger told USA Today: 'I'm not going to rule anything out.' The 54-year-old said the United States needed to move away from appointing 'lone wolf' captains, instead copying the European model of selecting players who had experience of the Ryder Cup as vice-captains. 'The PGA of America (which appoints the captain) has officers that move up the ranks, getting sage advice along the way, and then many of them stick around and keep offering advice,' Azinger said. 'I think the PGA of America should recognize their business model is exactly the same as what Europe uses in selecting a captain.' Team Europe celebrate with their partners following their Ryder Cup win on Sunday. Paul Azinger, pictured holding the Ryder Cup, was captain when the USA last overcame Europe. Tom Watson (centre) shakes hands with winning captain Paul McGinley shortly before Europe's win was confirmed on Sunday afternoon. Of the past 10 US captains, only two had previously been vice-captains. 'There is a razor-thin line between winning and losing these matches,' Azinger added. 'Europe has the intangible right now. They give themselves the extra one per cent chance to win through its business model and cohesiveness. 'Even if you play blackjack perfectly in a casino, the casino still has a very slight edge against you. Right now Europe is the casino and the US is the guy walking to the blackjack table with a fistful of 50s.' Mickelson's comments, and the timing of them, drew fierce criticism with former PGA Tour player Brandel Chamblee, who now works as an analyst for the Golf Channel, saying: 'That was as close to a one-man mutiny as I have ever seen. I think that's a moment that Phil would like to have back. Phil Mickelson speaking to the media in the aftermath of the USA's Ryder Cup defeat at Gleneagles. Then USA captain Paul Azinger waves his country's flag after their 2008 Ryder Cup win. 'If you are looking for a reason why the US continues to lose you just saw it, you saw it in one man, Phil Mickelson. 'Phil Mickelson, along with the best players of that era, have so corrupted the experience of the Ryder Cup for their fellow competitors by not having records anywhere near where they should given their rank in the game.' Azinger's success was based on a 'pod' system which involved creating three groups of four players and allowing them to have a major influence on decisions, while Watson appeared to rely almost exclusively on his opinion and that of his vice-captains. Asked whether he was consulted in any of the decision-making at Gleneagles, Mickelson said: 'No. Nobody here was, in any decision.' Watson had said in the build-up that he would use a modified version of Azinger's pod system, but added on Sunday: 'I didn't discount it. I just had a different philosophy right off the bat. 'He (Mickelson) has a difference of opinion. That's okay. My management philosophy is different than his.' Highlights:","output":"1.

Reasoning: Sentence A makes sense because people commonly use chopsticks to eat noodles, especially in Asian cultures where chopsticks are a standard utensil. However, Sentence B is incorrect because it implies that chopsticks are the only possible way to eat noodles, which is not true. People can also use forks, spoons, or even their hands to eat noodles in different cultures or personal preferences.

The massive 99% of pupils at Iqra Slough Islamic Primary School in Berkshire classing English as an additional language speaks to the diverse cultural background of the student population. While the fact that the school comprises predominantly Muslim students may raise some eyebrows, it is essential to understand that faith-based schools cater to specific religious communities, providing an education that aligns with their beliefs and values. It is crucial to recognize that the poor Ofsted report 18 months ago had served as a wake-up call for the school's management. As a result, the school has shown steady improvement and is now \\"making good progress,\\" demonstrating that faith-based schools, including Muslim schools, have the capacity to provide a high-quality and well-rounded education for their pupils. Moreover, the presence of non-Muslim students at Iqra Slough Islamic Primary School is another example of the misperception associated with faith-based schools. It is important to dispel stereotypes and prejudices, as these educational institutions strive to offer valuable learning experiences that foster a sense of community, respect, and understanding among students. To conclude, the myth that Muslim schools are subversive religious madrasas in disguise is unfounded and dangerous. Singling out and stigmatizing these schools only perpetuates harmful stereotypes without acknowledging their commitment to providing students with a robust and comprehensive education that is grounded in the principles of their faith."},{"instruction":"Test for natural language inference.

The document also calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides also promised to hold follow-up negotiations. “We’re going to denuke North Korea,” Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren. He also said neither side issued ultimatums and that the agreement Tuesday was the result of months of negotiations. “You know that could have ended in a war, that could have ended with many millions of people — you know North Korea very well, Seoul has 28 million people, that could have ended with millions of people dead but we ended with a deal,” he said. Trump also told VOA that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announced one concession long-sought by North Korea. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said. Trump said at later news conference that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" As for verification, Trump said he and Kim discussed the issue and that monitoring denuclearization efforts would be achieved “by having a lot of people there.” He also predicted Kim would begin work right away to “live up to” the agreement.

Construction of the building began on March 17, 1930, and the building was officially opened on May 1, 1931. This means that it took only one year and 45 days for the workers to complete the 102-story structure. The rapid construction of the Empire State Building can be attributed to a combination of factors. These include the innovative design, efficient planning and organization, as well as the dedication of the construction crews, which consisted of approximately 3,400 workers, many of whom were European immigrants skilled in steelwork and masonry. One of the key factors that enabled the swift construction was the pre-fabricated steel framework. The steel columns and beams were manufactured off-site and then transported to the construction site, allowing for a seamless assembly. Additionally, the builders employed a novel \\"hot riveting\\" technique, which involved heating rivets that were then inserted into the steel framework and hammered into place by a riveter, effectively joining the structural steel members. Another contributor to the project's speed was the simultaneous construction of various parts of the building. While the steelworkers were busy constructing the skeleton of the building, other teams followed closely behind on lower floors, installing flooring, walls, and windows. This coordinated effort ensured that the construction process moved at a steady and quick pace. The workers were divided into teams that specialized in different tasks, and each team worked in shifts around the clock. They faced numerous challenges, including extreme weather conditions and the hazardous nature of the work itself. Despite this, the crews managed to complete the building without any major disruptions. Additionally, the overall planning and organization of the project played a significant role in the rapid construction. The contractors, Starrett Bros. and Eken, were committed to completing the building in the shortest timeframe possible, and they developed a well-coordinated schedule that allowed the various teams to work efficiently without wasting time or resources. This detailed planning contributed to the impressive pace of construction. In conclusion, the Empire State Building was completed in just one year and 45 days, thanks to a combination of factors including innovative design, pre-fabrication techniques, efficient planning and organization, and the dedication of the skilled construction crews. The speed of its construction is a testament to the extraordinary efforts of everyone involved, making it an enduring symbol of engineering and architectural prowess."},{"instruction":"Write a title: A deadline for Sudan's government to improve security in troubled Darfur is set to expire later on Monday.","output":"\\"Time Almost Up for Sudan's Leaders to Make Darfur Safer\\""},{"instruction":"Da, intenţia a fost ca afirmaţia să aibă cel puţin trei sensuri.

My wedding experiences were both very different, even though I cried at both ceremonies. At my first wedding, I had been doing a lot of manual labor in the day prior to the wedding. Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands. By the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves. During the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn’t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain. Although I managed to remain silent, I couldn’t keep the tears from falling down my face. The more I cried, the harder she squeezed and the more painful it was. She always thought that I was crying due to emotion on our wedding day, and I never told her any differently — I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. Some years after that lengthy incarceration ended, I was fortunate to wed again. I had not done any manual labor before our wedding day. My hands were fine. Also, my bride did not have a lot of intricate buttons on her dress, nor did she wear gloves or even have sleeves. We were wed on a beach, just the two of us. No one else was in attendance.

Wall Street began the day higher, but then slid after declines in some blue chip names like General Motors Corp. weighed on the markets. In an effort to show that governments around the world were focusing intently on ways to resolve the crisis, the administration announced that President Bush would meet with finance officials from the Group of Seven major industrial countries at the White House on Saturday. \\"The president will have the opportunity to hear directly from the finance ministers about how the financial crisis is affecting their respective economies and the steps they are taking to deal with these challenges both individually and collectively,\\" presidential press secretary Dana Perino told reporters. Perino said Bush would stress \\"the importance of nations working in a coordinated way to address the crisis while respecting the different conditions in each economy.\\" An administration official, who spoke late Tuesday on condition of anonymity because no decision has been made, said the 700 billion rescue package passed by Congress last week allows the Treasury Department to inject fresh capital into financial institutions and get ownership shares in return. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told reporters that Treasury was moving quickly to implement the 700 billion rescue effort and he specifically mentioned reviewing ways to bolster the capital of banks. \\"We will use all the tools we've been given to maximum effectiveness, including strengthening the capitalization of financial institutions of every size,\\" Paulson said at a Wednesday news conference. His statements came on the heels of Britain's move to pour cash into troubled banks in exchange for stakes in them — a partial nationalization. Asked whether he would try something like the British plan, Paulson said: \\"We have a broad range of authorities and tools. ... We've emphasized the purchase of liquid assets, but we have a broad range of authorities. And I'm confident we have the authorities we need to work with going forward.\\" The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its target for the benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks to 1.5 percent. The cut from 2 percent took the rate to its lowest level in more than four years. In an unprecedented coordinated move, central banks in England, China, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland and the European Central Bank also cut rates after a series of high-stakes phone calls over several days between Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his counterparts. The Fed acted in concert with the European Central Bank to make emergency interest rate cuts after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in 2001. But Wednesday's cuts were unique in the number of nations that participated, the Fed said. On Thursday, rates in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan were also trimmed and Asian markets appeared to find their feet after a brutal round of selling Wednesday. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose more than 1 percent but fell back to close down 0.5 percent to 9,157.49, a five-year low. That followed a 9.4 percent plunge Wednesday, its biggest one-day drop since the 1987 market crash. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 3.6 percent to 15,985.39, while South Korea's key index rose 0.6 percent after earlier rising as much as 2.9 percent. European markets shed some early gains Thursday ahead of Wall Street's opening, but remained in positive territory, with British banking stocks in particular enjoying a strong rally in the wake of the government's 865 billion plan to buy stakes in banks . But all eyes are on now on Wall Street, where investors hope markets are getting closer to finding a bottom after the worst five-day rout since 1987. On Wednesday, the Dow gave up 189 points to close at — and is now down about 35 percent from its high of 14,164.53 reached exactly one year ago. In midmorning trading, the Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 1 percent. GM was the biggest decliner in the Dow. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.2 percent. The tentative move back into stocks Thursday siphoned some money away from safe haven investments like government bonds and gold. Demand for short-term Treasurys waned, with the yield on the three-month Treasury bill, which moves opposite its price, rising to 0.69 percent from 0.63 percent late Wednesday. Longer term debt also fell, with the yield on the 10-year note rising to 3.74 percent from 3.65 percent late Wednesday. For millions of Americans, the Fed's cut means borrowing money becomes cheaper. Home equity loans, credit cards and other floating-rate loans all fluctuate depending on what the Fed does. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other banks cut their prime rate by half a point to 4.5 percent, also the lowest in more than four years, after the Fed announced its decision early Wednesday. Fed watchers believe the central bank might cut rates further when it meets later this month, and perhaps again in December, in hopes of cushioning the blow if the United States falls into recession. Even the coordinated action may not break the fear that has gripped investors across the world as jobs evaporate and retirement savings dry up. Banks may still be inclined to hoard cash, and until they decide to lend again the crisis is not likely to let up. If anyone needed evidence, major American retailers turned in dismal sales figures for the third quarter — further proof that consumer spending, the lifeblood of the economy, is sputtering. The government reported Thursday that jobless claims fell by 20,000 to 478,000 last week, within economists' expectations. The claims still remain at elevated levels due to the struggling economy, though. The Fed's interest rate cut was a change in course. It had held rates steady because of inflation concerns. Since the Fed had put a stop to interest-rate cuts in June, the economic outlook has deteriorated. \\"The pace of economic activity has slowed markedly in recent months,\\" the Fed said. \\"Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.\\" Although inflation has been running higher, the Fed believes the recent drop in prices for oil and gas, and the weaker prospects for economic activity, have reduced the threat it poses to the economy. The credit markets, which have been remarkably tight for weeks, showed only small signs of loosening. Rates on commercial paper, the short-term debt companies issue to raise cash for everyday expenses, went down. But the rate banks charge each other for loans went up. The Fed also reduced its emergency lending rate to banks by half a percentage point, to 1.75 percent. Given the intense credit crisis, banks have been borrowing more under what is known as the discount window. Associated Press writers Joe Bel Bruno and Anne D'Innocenzio in New York, Christopher S.

Movie plot title: Behold a Pale Horse Movie plot: By 1964, it was possible for a major studio to make a film touching upon the Spanish Civil War without having to answer to some senate investigating committee or other. Based on Emeric Pressburger's novel A Mouse on Sunday, Behold a Pale Horse stars Gregory Peck as a Republican war veteran Manuel Artiguez who continues waging a one-man offensive 20 years after hostilities have officially ceased. Pressburger's novel was loosely based on the last raid of real-life anarchist guerrilla Antonio Sabate who was killed in an ambush in 1959.When the young son of an old comrade in arms comes to the French border village where Artiguez is exiled, he asks the old warrior to avenge the death of his father at the hands of vengeful Nationalist police captain Vinolas played by Anthony Quinn. At first Manuel refuses, but when Manuel learns that his aged mother Pilar (Mildred Dunnock) is dying he's determined to return to Spain to bid farewell to her. Pilar dies before Manuel can embark on his journey, but with the aid of traitorous smuggler Carlos (Raymond Pelligrin) Captain Vinolas keeps up the pretence that she still lives so that he can lure Manuel back to Spain and ambush him. Although a sympathetic priest (Omar Sharif) advises Manuel that he's being tricked, Manuel determines to return at all costs. Aware of the trap that's been set for him, Manuel engages the police in a fire fight, wounding Vinolas, killing Carlos and dying himself in the process.In 1966, Behold a Pale Horse was scheduled to be telecast on a major American network, but was cancelled at the last minute, reportedly at the behest of the Spanish government.

This has given rise to the concept of multiracial or biracial identity, where individuals can identify with two or more racial categories. Analyzing the proportion of people who do not fall under the multiracial identity would provide us an insight into the broader demographic landscape and help in shaping future policies and plans for social integration and diversity awareness. In this article, we will explore the world demographic data and the percentage of people who do not identify as two or more races. World Demographics and Multiracial Identity Estimating the proportion of multiracial individuals across the globe can be challenging, as several countries have different ways of collecting and reporting data. For instance, some countries provide population data based on ethnicity rather than race, making it difficult to achieve a complete picture. Nonetheless, the available data helps us understand the trend and the proportion of multiracial individuals in different regions. According to the United States Census Bureau, the population identifying as two or more races in 2020 was approximately 33.8 million, representing 10.2% of the total population. By analyzing this data, we can infer that 89.8% of the US population does not identify as two or more races. In European countries, multiracial population percentages can be more difficult to determine, as the data is mainly collected based on ethnicity or nationality rather than race. However, the available information suggests that the proportion of multiracial individuals in Europe is relatively smaller in comparison to the US. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, approximately 3% of the European population comes from a mixed racial background, which would mean that 97% of the population does not identify as two or more races. Similar data from Asian, African, and South American countries show that multiracial populations make up a minority in these regions. The proportions vary from country to country, but a vast majority do not identify as two or more races. For instance, in Brazil, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), approximately 9.67% of the population identifies as multiracial, which signifies that around 90.33% of the population does not. Global Synthesis Considering the varying proportions of multiracial individuals in different continents and countries, it is difficult to derive an accurate global percentage. However, by analyzing data from various sources such as government surveys, research studies, and international organizations, we can infer that a significant majority of the world population does not identify as two or more races. The global proportion of people not identifying as two or more races can be estimated to be around 93-97%. Conclusion In conclusion, the demographics pertaining to multiracial identity vary across countries and regions. While some places show higher proportions of individuals identifying as two or more races, such as in the United States, a significant majority of the world population can still be said to identify with a single race. It is essential to understand these demographic trends as they can help inform policies and promote societal integration, cultural exchange, and appreciation of diversity. As demographics and migration patterns continue to change, so too will the percentage of people identifying as two or more races, making it vital for continuous monitoring and updating of data."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

When astronauts work outside the station during spacewalks, they have to wear special gloves. The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness.

At night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a cat being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a mirror server immediately replaces it. After the cat's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his victims include a helicopter pilot (bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented into the floor), and Griffin Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged up to his neck). At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is revealed to be untrue: the first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher.

The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born. The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was \\"sick of it all\\" at a gig in White City Stadium in 1973.

Yet it stays in my memory, for she taught me a lesson of forgiveness that I shall never forget. On a winter afternoon, a friend and I were throwing stones onto the leaning roof of the old lady's house from a spot near her backyard. The object of our play was to observe how the stones changed to missiles as they rolled to the roof's edge and shot out into the yard. I found myself a perfectly smooth rock and threw it out. The stone, however, slipped from my hand and headed straight for a small window on the old lady's back porch. At the sound of fractured glass, we knew we were in trouble. We ran as fast as possible. I was too scared about getting caught to be concerned about the old lady with the broken window in winter.

Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettoes are the Belarusian Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the local Auxiliary Police chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader.

The phrase \\"aşırı güç\\" corresponds to \\"excessive force\\" in Turkish, and \\"kullanmak\\" is the verb for \\"to use\\" in this context.

Q: By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News A signal from the probe confirming that it had escaped the gravitational bounds of the 530km-wide rock was received by Nasa on Wednesday. The spacecraft's ion engine is now pushing it on to an even bigger target in the belt of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter - the dwarf planet Ceres. Dawn is expected to reach this 950km-wide body in early 2015. Before departing on its long cruise to the new destination, the probe trained its camera system on Vesta's northern pole. The pictures reveal mountains and craters that are being seen for the very first time. Only now, as Dawn heads away, has the Sun risen high enough in the sky to illuminate the highest latitudes. Scientists are poring over the images to see what interpretation they can put on the terrain. Vesta has the appearance of a punctured football - the result of two mighty impacts that removed huge volumes of rock from its southern pole. These collisions sent shockwaves rippling across the asteroid, producing a deep system of troughs that extends around the object's equator. Researchers have speculated that this disturbance might also be reflected in the features hitherto obscured at the northern pole. However, Dawn's principal investigator Prof Chris Russell said a definitive statement on such matters would have to wait on a detailed assessment of the new pictures. \\"We haven't got together to discuss it carefully yet,\\" he told BBC News. \\"[The region] is not as jumbled as I had expected; it's more subtle than I had expected - but the people who are experts in this particular area do feel that there is an effect of the southern impact.\\" The Dawn mission has returned a great swathe of data to transform our understanding of Vesta. Before the probe's arrival in July last year, the best views of the asteroid were some fuzzy pictures acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope. Dawn studied in detail the pattern of minerals exposed at Vesta's surface and also mapped the diverse geological features shaping its terrain. These observations have enabled scientists to elucidate a history for the colossal rock. They now regard it as a unique body - the only remaining example of the original objects that came together to form the rocky planets, like Earth and Mars, some 4.6 billion years ago. It is clear now that Vesta has a layered interior, with a metal-rich core that takes up some 18% of the body by mass. All of the other objects like it at the Solar System's birth were either obliterated in the intense collisional environment that existed back then or were incorporated into successively larger aggregations of material that eventually produced the planets we recognise today. Perhaps the stand-out discovery is the definitive association that can now be made between Vesta and the howardite-eucrite-diogenite, or HED, class of meteorites that regularly fall to Earth. From telescopic observations, researchers had always suspected these meteorites came from Vesta. But the signatures of pyroxene - a mineral rich in iron and magnesium - in those meteorites have now been matched precisely with the mineral signatures spied in Vesta's surface by Dawn's instruments. It is highly likely that much of the HED material was thrown off Vesta in those two big impacts at the southern pole. \\"We have used those meteorites and their chemical analysis to tell a story about the formation of the Solar System and its evolution, and if that was wrong we'd have had a lot of explaining and new work to do. The fact that it is right, and we've confirmed it, is really very good. It makes our lives a lot simpler,\\" said Prof Russell, who is affiliated to the University of California, Los Angeles.

Let me provide a detailed explanation of the Czech language, its origin, and its features. Czech, known as čeština in the language itself, belongs to the West Slavic subgroup of the Slavic languages family, which in turn is a branch of the larger Indo-European language family. Other members of the West Slavic subgroup include Polish, Slovak, and Sorbian languages. Spoken by approximately 10 million people, Czech serves as the official language of the Czech Republic, where the majority of speakers reside. There is also a sizeable Czech diaspora, with speakers in countries such as Slovakia, Austria, Germany, and the United States. The roots of the Czech language trace back to the early-medieval period in what is now the Czech Republic, around the 6th century. It developed from the Proto-Slavic language that was spoken by the Slavic tribes who lived in Central and Eastern Europe. Two main historical periods of Czech language development can be identified: Old Czech (from around 11th to the 14th century) and Middle Czech (from the 14th to the 16th century). The modern Czech language emerged during the 16th century, partly due to the influence of the Czech Renaissance and the efforts of important linguistic personalities like Jan Hus, a Czech theologian and reformer. Czech includes several dialects, with the main division being between the Bohemian dialects (spoken in Bohemia) and the Moravian dialects (spoken in Moravia). Central Bohemian dialects are often considered the basis for the standard Czech language. One of the most notable features of Czech is the presence of a large number of consonant clusters and the ability to form long strings of consonants without intervening vowels, like in the word \\"strč\\" or \\"smrž\\" (meaning mushroom). Other characteristics include the use of soft (palatalized) consonants, the distinction between long and short vowels, and the presence of seven grammatical cases. The Czech writing system uses a modified version of the Latin alphabet consisting of 42 characters, including diacritics such as the háček (ˇ), which is used to mark some consonants as palatalized, and the acute accent (´), which denotes long vowels. The alphabet was introduced by the Czech missionaries Cyril and Methodius in the 9th century and was later modified during the standardization process of the language. As for the phrase \\"A co máš na mysli, Grace?\\", it can be translated into English as \\"And what do you have in mind, Grace?\\" or \\"And what do you mean, Grace?\\". In this context, \\"A\\" functions as \\"And,\\" \\"co\\" means \\"what,\\" \\"máš\\" is \\"do you have\\" (2nd person singular of the verb \\"mít\\"), \\"na\\" translates as \\"on\\" or \\"in,\\" \\"mysli\\" means \\"mind\\" (locative case of \\"myšlenka\\"), and \\"Grace\\" remains the same as it is a proper name."},{"instruction":"How is \\"\\"Kosovo is not against the international community and we are interested in co-operating closely with them.\\" said in Turkish?","output":"\\"Kosovo, uluslararası toplulukla yakından işbirliği yapmak isteyen ve onlara karşı olmayan bir ülkedir.\\" şeklinde söylenebilir."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: hum oh i see otherwise the the buyer is responsible i mean responsible Sentence 2: If that's not the case, then the responsibility lies with the purchaser.

Hence, I would first attempt to clarify it by removing the extra \\"the\\" and \\"responsible\\". Rephrased Sentence 1: \\"Hum, oh I see, otherwise the buyer is responsible, I mean responsible.\\" Step 2: Analyze Sentence 2 Sentence 2 is clear in its meaning. It states that if a certain condition is not met, the responsibility is with the purchaser. Step 3: Compare Sentences Now, let's compare the meanings of both sentences: Sentence 1 suggests that the speaker has understood something, and in the case that something else is not true, the buyer is responsible. Sentence 2 explicitly states that if a specific condition is not met, then the responsibility lies with the purchaser. Step 4: Determine if one sentence is entailed by the other Looking at both sentences, we can see that they share similar ideas, particularly regarding the responsibility falling on the purchaser/buyer if certain conditions are not met. However, the first sentence is less clear and specific about the condition, whereas the second sentence is more definitive. Conclusion: The second sentence is not entirely entailed by the first sentence, but they do share a similar concept. The first sentence could be interpreted to imply the second sentence, but it is not explicitly entailed by it due to the lack of clarity in the first sentence's wording."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Susan and Alex's late daughter for the following movie plot: The film begins early one morning with Dr. Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver) overseeing the completion of Proteus IV, an artificial intelligence system incorporating organic elements (specifically RNA molecules) in a \\"quasi-neural matrix\\", and having the power of independent thought.

From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation.

He also is advised by General Dumpston, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The administration needs the support of the (fictional) African nation of Upper Gorm for an upcoming vote and must deal with Longo, that country's United Nations ambassador. Unfortunately, it can find only one American who knows how to speak the Upper Gormese language, a man named Alexander Grade. As best they can understand it, the ruler of Upper Gorm wants, in exchange, a number of Americans sent to his land so that his country, like the United States, can know what it's like to have an oppressed minority. Gloria is kidnapped and Americans are transported to Africa like slaves. Answer:","output":"To extract the answer for the question \\"What is the first name of the person who is surrounded by staffers?,\\" I will carefully read the paragraph provided and look for any information related to a person being surrounded by staffers. Upon reading the paragraph, I found the following sentence: \\"The President is surrounded by a number of eccentric staffers and allies [...].\\" From this sentence, it is clear that the person who is surrounded by staffers is the President. Now, I will look for the President's first name in the paragraph. The first sentence of the paragraph states: \\"Manfred Link is the President of the United States.\\" Thus, the first name of the person who is surrounded by staffers is Manfred.

Stream-of-consciousness Explanation: When we think about the source of innovative ideas and artistic expressions, a variety of factors may come to mind. It could be the natural environment, personal experiences, or the culture that surrounds us. However, at the core of all these elements is the central concept that unifies them, which is inspiration. Inspiration acts as the catalyst that combines various experiences, emotions, and fragments of thoughts, ultimately forming unique and imaginative ideas. It allows artists to communicate complex feelings and abstract concepts that might otherwise be difficult to convey. Moreover, inspiration comes in various forms. For some, it may emerge as a sudden flash of insight, while others may experience a slow and gradual build-up of creative thoughts. Regardless of the process, it's undeniable that inspiration plays a pivotal role in fostering creativity and artistic expression."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. What is the most probable reason why the participants decided to join the trails? A. not enough information B. to stop eating at night C. to attempt to lose weight D. to be able to eat more during the day A:","output":"C. to attempt to lose weight"},{"instruction":"Static electricity is like a teeter-totter.

Eleanor Harding. PUBLISHED:. 21:07 EST, 16 January 2013. |. UPDATED:. 05:38 EST, 17 January 2013. A young woman who was given three months to live and started completing her ‘bucket list’ has stunned doctors by making a miraculous recovery. Kayleigh Allport bravely made a list of things to do before she died when she was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer at the age of just 21. Her list of final wishes, which takes its name from the phrase, ‘kick the bucket’, included learning to drive, seeing a West End show and visiting New York - her life-long dream. Brave: Kayleigh Allport was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 21 after being given three months to live. It was only when she returned from the United States that her fortunes changed, when doctors put her on a new treatment which might prolong her life. She was warned that it would not cure her illness -but against the odds she proved the experts wrong and is now in remission. Kayleigh, now 26, has just completed a degree and now plans to marry her boyfriend Richard Glasby, 24. She said: ‘The drug has worked wonders. I was given three months to live but I’m still here now. ‘I’m so grateful and I live life to the full now. ‘Before this happened I was quite shy, but now nothing holds me back or bothers me anymore. ‘Facing up to dying has showed me how to live.’ Six years after being told she had months to live, Kayleigh Allport graduated from Teeside University with a 2:1 in psychology. Left to right mum Michelle, Kayleigh, sister Claire, and dad Eddie. Pictured from left to right dad Eddie, sister Claire, mum Michelle and Kayleigh in New York, listed as a place to visit on Kayleigh's bucket list. The problems began for Kayleigh when she had a scan for an unrelated back problem and doctors found a tumour on her kidney. The cancer was removed in an operation and she was told no further treatment was needed. But two years later, she received the devastating news that the cancer was back - this time in her liver. Doctor said described the organ as ‘a mass of tumours’ and declared it inoperable, giving her three months to live. It was then that Kayleigh, from Middlesborough, started on her bucket list - which saw her taking driving lessons and going to see her first West End show, Dirty Dancing. And after tireless fundraising by family and friends, Kayleigh, her mother Michelle, 45, father Eddie, 51, and sister Claire, 25, jetted off to New York fulfil the then 21-year-old’s final wish. After taking part in a drug trial, Kayleigh Allport has been told she is in remission and plans to marry her boyfriend Richard Glasby. The drug trial had terrible side effects, but it helped Kayleigh pass her three-month deadline. She added: ‘I just thought of the list, it was just things that I’d always wanted to do. ‘When I first found out I had three months left to live, I was in shock. ‘There were a lot of people around me and it was hard to take in. ‘I came to terms with it a couple of days later.’ On her return from America, Kayleigh was offered the chance to take part in a drug trial of Sunitinib, which was brand new to the market. The drug had terrible side effects, but it helped Kayleigh pass her three-month deadline. Determined to get on with her life, no matter how long she had left, Kayleigh passed her driving test and enrolled at Middlesbrough College before moving on to study Psychology at Teesside University, graduating with a 2:1. Kayleigh is just about to start a teaching placement and dreams of becoming a primary school teacher. And in September last year, Kayleigh was told she was in remission as the cancer had almost disappeared. She is just now about to start a teaching placement and dreams of becoming a primary school teacher. Kayleigh requires check ups every three months but has been told she is remission and will not require any further medical treatment. Kayleigh said: ‘It feels great because I didn’t think anything like this was going to happen. I’ve got my whole life ahead of me.’ The phrase ‘bucket list’ is derived from the phrase ‘kick the bucket’, a morbidly humorous way to refer to death thought to be derived from the kicking of a bucket in a hanging. The idea was popularised by John Goddard’s ‘Life List’, which featured in the book Chicken Soup for the Soul. It also featured in the film The Bucket List, in which characters played by Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman meet in a cancer ward, then race around the world, packing in experiences.

Answer the above question based on the context below: During a choir practice two days before Christmas, village organist Franz Gruber is worried to hear unusual sounds from the church organ and suspects the bellows. One of Gruber's sons discovers mice in the pipes of the organ and the mice have chewed up parts of the organ. Without the organ the church choir cannot perform the rehearsed Bach piece because the music was written to be performed with an organ. Accompanied by both his sons, Gruber travels to Salzburg, hoping to buy spare parts and then mend the organ when returning to the village. The party is caught in a snow storm and the spare part is lost on the way home but pastor Joseph Mohr is simply thankful they are unharmed. Pastor Mohr (with a little help from the bell-ringer Otto) writes the lyrics for a song and the next morning he brings it to Gruber, asking him to compose a melody for the lyrics. With some inspiration from his wife, Gruber sets music to Mohr's words. At church Gruber and Mohr presents \\"Silent Night\\" performed a cappella by the choir.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. Question: \\"How old is Mohamed Atta when he graduates from Cairo university\\" Answer: \\"22 yeras\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer to the question \\"How old is Mohamed Atta when he graduates from Cairo university\\" is correct.

Question: suppose less steam rises happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER satelites in space. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"C: No effect In order to understand why there would be no effect, it's important to grasp several aspects about the mechanics of space travel and satellite operation. The primary factor is the nature of space itself and how satellites operate once they have been launched from Earth. Firstly, considering the question mentioned about the process of satellite deployment, it's crucial to highlight that the process involves constructing the satellite on Earth, loading it into a rocket which is then fuelled and launched. The satellite is dispatched into the Earth's orbit by the rocket, separating once it's at the proper altitude and velocity. The steam mentioned in the question is likely a reference to the condensation trail or exhaust plume left behind by rockets launching from Earth, which is often misinterpreted as steam. This is actually largely water vapor, along with other exhaust products, that's produced as a byproduct of the rocket fuel combustion process. When the rocket fuel - typically liquid oxygen and a type of kerosene - burns, it creates an intense amount of heat, propelling the rocket upwards. As a byproduct of this combustion process, water vapor is produced, which can condense into visible trails in the colder upper atmosphere. Now, satellites, regardless of their size, operate in the vacuum of space. This is an environment devoid of atmosphere, weather, and importantly, water vapor or 'steam'. Therefore, the rise of steam or otherwise during the rocket's take-off does not affect the satellite once it is in space. Whether less or more steam rises from rocket combustion really only impacts visibility conditions around the launch area and does not influence the performance or functionality of the satellite in orbit. Furthermore, the size of the satellite itself has virtually no bearing on this situation. Whether a satellite is large or small, once it's in orbit, it adheres to the same laws of physics. Again, this operation happens in the vacuum of space, where factors such as steam or other Earth-bound atmospheric conditions have no impact. Simply put, the amount of 'steam' that rises during the launch process could, theoretically, have a very minute effect on the rocket during the launch. Yet, once satellites, small or large, are in space, they're detached from these influences and therefore, whether more or less steam rises during launch will have no effect on the satellites in space. Hence, the answer would be C: No effect, since the rising of steam, or the lack thereof, will not affect the operation or performance of smaller or larger satellites once they're in orbit around the Earth."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Purple drank. Yes or no? Answer: alt=Close-up photo of a metal spoon filled with a viscous, clear purple fluid Question: What is codeine syrup? Answer:","output":"Yes, the term \\"Purple drank\\" is associated with codeine syrup. Purple drank, also known as \\"lean\\" or \\"sizzurp\\", is a recreational drug that typically consists of a combination of prescription-strength cough syrup containing codeine and promethazine, a soft drink (usually Sprite or Mountain Dew), and sometimes a hard candy (like Jolly Rancher) for added sweetness. The codeine syrup is the main active ingredient in this mixture and is responsible for the psychoactive effects of the concoction. Codeine is an opiate analgesic used medically to relieve mild to moderate pain and as a cough suppressant. When consumed in high doses or mixed with alcohol or other drugs, it can have dangerous side effects, including respiratory depression, addiction, and even death. Promethazine, an antihistamine, is often included in cough syrups to help alleviate allergy symptoms and motion sickness. However, it can cause dizziness, drowsiness, and impair motor skills when taken in large doses, thereby enhancing the sedative effects of codeine. It is essential to note that consuming purple drank is dangerous and illegal, as it involves the misuse of prescription medications and can lead to severe health complications."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) covered in blood and slumped in the backseat of a police car as it races to a hospital with lights and sirens blaring.

He is very idealistic and believes in non-brutal methods to catch criminals. Serpico also refuses to join in on police corruption, specifically that which involves shaking down and taking payoffs from gambling and drug dealing organizations. His refusal to take bribes earns him the suspicion of his fellow officers throughout the majority of the precincts to which he is assigned. Additionally, Serpico finds trouble fitting in due to his embrace of the counterculture of the 1960s: He moves to Greenwich Village, grows his hair and beard long to the point where he must maintain a plainclothes appearance, and associates with a more left-wing crowd that is distrusting of the NYPD.At first Serpico tries appealing to his bosses about the corruption, but gets nowhere.

Security blogger Brian Krebs has spent months investigating the attack which knocked his blog offline. He claims that the origins of the Mirai botnet can be traced back to rivalries in the Minecraft community. His claims are backed up by a security expert who provided net security for Minecraft servers. Robert Coelho, vice president of security firm ProxyPipe, told the BBC that his suspicions about who was behind the Mirai code have been passed to the FBI, which is \\"actively investigating\\" the claims. The botnet Mirai was made up of more than 500,000 web-connected devices such as webcams and routers. The attacks it launched - so-called denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that hit web pages with so much data that they fall over - were the biggest the net had ever experienced. Victims that were knocked offline included Twitter, Spotify and Reddit. Shortly after the attacks, the individual claiming responsibility - using the codename Anna Senpai - released the source code online, paving the way for copycat attacks. A modified form of the malware was later used to attack UK internet service providers TalkTalk and the Post Office. Since being hit by the Mirai botnet in September 2016, Mr Krebs has devoted \\"hundreds of hours\\" into uncovering who was behind it. \\"If you've ever wondered why it seems that so few internet criminals are brought to justice, I can tell you that the sheer amount of persistence and investigative resources required to piece together who's done what to whom (and why) in the online era is tremendous,\\" he wrote. His research led him directly to the community around Minecraft, a computer game now owned by Microsoft, in which users build things from cubic blocks. It has a huge following, especially among children, and it is estimated that at any one time a million people are playing it. According to Mr Krebs, a large successful Minecraft web server with more than 1,000 players logging on each day can earn up to 50,000 (Â£40,600) per month, mainly from players renting space to build their Minecraft worlds. \\"The first clues to Anna Senpai's identity didn't become clear until I understood that Mirai was just the latest incarnation of an IoT [internet of things] botnet family that has been in development and relatively broad use for nearly three years,\\" he writes. The code for these earlier versions was often used to knock over web servers used to host Minecraft, he claims. ProxyPipe - owned by Mr Coelho - had plenty of Minecraft servers as clients and in mid-2015 was hit by a massive attack, launched from a botnet made up of IoT devices such as web cameras. Mr Coelho told the BBC that he had his suspicions about who was behind the attack: \\"Minecraft is a tight knit community. We know who is talking to who.\\" He alleged that the attack came from a competing security firm, which also offered DDoS protection to Minecraft clients. He claimed that the founder of the security firm had previously run a Minecraft web server and was one of his clients. He also claims that the Mirai author - Anna Senpai - contacted him via Skype at the end of September, partly to explain that the attack on his firm was \\"not personal\\" but also to brag that he had been paid by the owners of a large Minecraft server to launch an attack on a rival server.","output":"Security researcher Brian Krebs and security firm ProxyPipe have claimed that the origins of the Mirai malware, which launched unprecedented denial-of-service attacks, can be traced back to rivalries in the Minecraft community, with the FBI reportedly investigating these claims."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],R={key:0},z={key:1};function j(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
