I found the following answer on Google: However, because negligence cases are very fact-specific, this general definition does not fully explain the concept of when the law will require one person to compensate another for losses caused by accidental injury. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is a correct starting point, but it does not completely cover the entire concept of negligence in tort law. To provide a more detailed explanation, let me further clarify the concept and its components. Negligence, as a concept in tort law, pertains to the failure of an individual to exercise reasonable care that results in harm or damage to another person or their property. In other words, negligence arises when someone's actions or omissions fall below the standard of care expected of a reasonably cautious person under the given circumstances. To establish negligence and hold the defendant liable, the plaintiff must prove four primary elements: 1. Duty of Care: The first element to be proven is that the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff. This means that the defendant had a legal obligation to act with reasonable care toward the plaintiff or be responsible for the plaintiff's well-being. Duty of care may arise from various relationships, such as a driver's duty to other road users or a doctor's duty to their patients. 2. Breach of Duty: The second element involves proving that the defendant breached their duty of care by failing to exercise reasonable care. This can be demonstrated by showing that the defendant's conduct fell short of the standard expected of a person in a similar situation. For instance, a driver who was texting while driving or a property owner who failed to repair a broken handrail. 3. Causation: The third element in a negligence case is proving that the defendant's breach of duty directly caused the plaintiff's injury or harm. This is often referred to as the \\"cause-in-fact\\" or \\"but-for\\" test, meaning that the injury would not have occurred but for the defendant's negligence. For example, if a driver's inattention caused them to rear-end another car, there is a direct causal link between the negligent action and the resulting damage. 4. Damages: The final element in proving negligence requires showing that the plaintiff suffered actual harm or damages as a result of the defendant's negligence. These damages can be physical, emotional, or financial and must be quantifiable. Examples include medical bills, lost income, property damage, or pain and suffering. In tort law, negligence cases vary significantly based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case. The success of a negligence claim depends on the plaintiff's ability to prove each of these four elements. It is crucial for legal practitioners and plaintiffs to carefully analyze the facts at hand and gather strong evidence supporting each element of negligence to effectively establish liability and seek appropriate compensation for the harm or losses caused by the defendant's negligent actions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: After the release of better-than-expected deficit data for 2014, Finance Minister Michel Sapin said there were reasons to be confident about growth. Official data showed the 2014 deficit was 4% instead of the 4.4% forecast, and will fall to about 3.8% this year, Mr Sapin predicted. The eurozone's second biggest economy has held back the euro bloc's growth. Following the improved data, Mr Sapin said economic growth could beat the government's 1% forecast. \\"A lower-than-expected deficit brings confidence,\\" he said. \\"We will do better than 1% (economic) growth in 2015.\\" Public spending has fallen, and last year's expected shortfall in revenues was not a bad as initially thought. \\"Things are falling into place to back the scenario of growth accelerating in 2015,\\" said Credit Agricole economist Axelle Lacan. The eurozone's second-largest economy grew by 0.4% in 2014, the data confirmed on Thursday, the same pace as in 2013. France, which has repeatedly missed its fiscal targets, is confident it will finally bring the deficit below an EU cap of 3% of GDP in 2017. President Francois Hollande, during his 2012 election campaign, had pledged to bring the deficit down to the EU limit by end-2013 but his government has since pushed the target back several times. This month, European Union finance ministers gave France two more years to cut the deficit to the 3% limit, extending the deadline for the third time since 2009. Recent economic data has showed that although unemployment is still rising, business confidence has improved. Summary:","output":"France found out that they didn't owe as much money as they thought they did in 2014. This makes their Finance Minister, Michel Sapin, feel good about their chances to grow. He thinks things will get better than they planned, and they will be able to follow the rules set by the European Union by 2017. This is good news because France is a big part of the group of countries that use the Euro, and their growth will help everyone else too."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Against the supposition that forest fires in Alaska, Canada and Siberia warm the climate, scientists have discovered that cooling may occur in areas where burnt trees allow more snow to mirror more sunlight into space. This finding suggests that taking steps to prevent northern forest fires to limit the release of greenhouse gases may warm the climate in northern regions. Usually large fires destroyed forests in these areas over the past decade. Scientists predict that with climate warming, fires may occur more frequently over the next several centuries as a result of a longer fire season. Sunlight taken in by the earth tends to cause warming, while heat mirrored back into space tends to cause cooling. This is the first study to analyze all aspects of how northern fires influence climate. Earlier studies by other scientists have suggested that fire in northern regions speed up climate warming because greenhouse gases from burning trees and plants are released into the atmosphere and thus trap heat. Scientists found that right after the fire, large amounts of greenhouse gases entered the atmosphere and caused warming. Ozone  levels increased, and ash from the fire fell on far-off sea ice, darkening the surface and causing more radiation from the sun to be taken in. The following spring, however, the land within the area of the fire was brighter than before the fire, because fewer trees covered the ground. Snow on the ground mirrored more sunlight back into space, leading to cooling. \\"We need to find out all possible ways to reduce the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\\" Scientists tracked the change in the amount of radiation entering and leaving the climate system as a result of the fire, and found a measurement closely related to the global air temperature.

Now, The New York Times, in its Saturday print edition, is taking the rare step of running a front page editorial calling for tighter gun control laws. The paper has not run a page one editorial since 1920. GOP OFFERS PRAYERS, NOT SOLUTIONS, ON CALIF. MASSACRE \\"We do so today to deliver a strong and visible statement of frustration and anguish about our country's inability to come to terms with the scourge of guns,\\" Times Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said in a statement. \\"Even in this digital age, the front page remains an incredibly strong and powerful way to surface issues that demand attention.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the urban hubs that are within 6 miles of the ridge that picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge? , can you please find it?   The Metacomet Ridge picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge, beginning on Sugarloaf Mountain and the parallel massif of Mount Toby, 1,269 feet (387 m), the high point of the Metacomet Ridge geography. Both Sugarloaf Mountain and Mount Toby are composed of erosion-resistant sedimentary rock. North of Mount Sugarloaf, the Pocumtuck Ridge continues as alternating sedimentary and traprock dominated strata to Greenfield, Massachusetts. From Greenfield north to 2 miles (3 km) short of the Vermont–New Hampshire–Massachusetts tri-border, the profile of the Metacomet Ridge diminishes into a series of nondescript hills and low, wooded mountain peaks composed of sedimentary rock with dwindling traprock outcrops.In Connecticut, the high point of the Metacomet Ridge is West Peak of the Hanging Hills at 1,024 feet (312 m); in Massachusetts, the highest traprock peak is Mount Tom, 1,202 feet (366 m), although Mount Toby, made of sedimentary rock, is higher. Visually, the Metacomet Ridge is narrowest at Provin Mountain and East Mountain in Massachusetts where it is less than 0.5 miles (1 km) wide; it is widest at Totoket Mountain, over 4 miles (6 km). However, low parallel hills and related strata along much of the range often make the actual geologic breadth of the Metacomet Ridge wider than the more noticeable ridgeline crests, up to 10 miles (16 km) across in some areas. Significant river drainages of the Metacomet Ridge include the Connecticut River and tributaries (Falls River, Deerfield River, Westfield River, Farmington River, Coginchaug River); and, in southern Connecticut, the Quinnipiac River.The Metacomet Ridge is surrounded by rural wooded, agricultural, and suburban landscapes, and is no more than 6 miles (10 km) from a number of urban hubs such as New Haven, Meriden, New Britain, Hartford, and Springfield. Small city centers abutting the ridge include Greenfield, Northampton, Amherst, Holyoke, West Hartford, Farmington, Wallingford, and Hamden.

In contextul actual al politicii globale, unde probleme precum imigrația, criza economică și securitatea națională sunt preocupări majore, sunt lideri politici care profită de aceste temeri pentru a-și spori popularitatea și a câștiga voturile oamenilor. Acești politicieni, adesea etichetați ca populisti, folosesc argumente bazate pe emoții și pe sentimentul național în detrimentul argumentelor raționale și a faptelor concrete. Manipularea acestor temeri și a argumentelor iraționale a avut un impact semnificativ asupra vieții politice internaționale. Multe dintre țările afectate de către creșterea populismului se confruntă acum cu dezbinare, polarizare și, în unele cazuri, instabilitate. De aceea, este imperativ ca liderii politici care se opun acestui gen de manipulare să lupte împotriva acestei tendințe, promovând transparența, onestitatea și lucrul în echipă în sfera publică. Pentru a combate manipularea bazată pe temeri și argumente iraționale, este esențial ca informațiile să fie corecte și ușor de înțeles pentru cetățeni. Prin încurajarea educației și a accesului la informații, precum și prin promovarea unui discurs public bazat pe respect și toleranță, liderii politici pot contribui la reducerea influenței populismului. În plus, este important ca liderii politici să își asume responsabilitatea de a lua decizii bine fundamentate, bazate pe dovezi și respect pentru drepturile și nevoile tuturor cetățenilor. Aceasta include promovarea unei abordări mai incluzive și participative în procesul decizional, asigurându-se că vocile minorităților și ale celor marginalizați sunt incluse și luate în considerare. Pe termen lung, înfrângerea populismului și a manipulării bazate pe temeri și argumente iraționale va necesita un efort susținut și coordonat din partea liderilor politici, organizațiilor civile și a cetățenilor înșiși.

Lake Superior is incredibly vast and holds enough water to cover the entire landmass of North and South America to a depth of 1 foot (30 centimeters). It is a vital ecological resource, as it is home to various species of fish, birds, and other wildlife. It also has a significant impact on regional climate, affecting temperatures, precipitation, and land use patterns in the surrounding areas. Economically, Lake Superior is instrumental in supporting both commercial and recreational industries. Shipping and cargo transportation through the St. Lawrence Seaway contribute to trade between the US, Canada, and other nations.

The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage, which historically was Rome's deadliest foe. The queen, Dido, welcomes the ancestor of the Romans, and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him. At a banquet in Book 2, Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy, the death of his wife, and his escape, to the enthralled Carthaginians, while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home. Jupiter in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city, and he slips away from Carthage, leaving Dido to commit suicide, cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in a symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome.

Question: Who takes over after Taha is killed Title: District B13 Movie plot: In 2010, social problems have overrun the poorer suburbs of Paris; especially Banlieue 13, commonly referred to as B13: a ghetto with a population of some two million. Unable to control B13, the authorities construct a high wall topped by barbed tape around the entire area, forcing the inhabitants within to survive without education, proper utilities or police protection behind the containment wall. Police checkpoints stop anybody going in or out. Three years later, the district has become overrun with gangs. LeÃ¯to (David Belle) is a fighter of such gangs. The beginning of the film depicts LeÃ¯to washing a case full of drugs down the drain, then escaping the gang who has come to collect the drugs. The gang's leader, Taha, kidnaps LeÃ¯to's sister Lola in retaliation; LeÃ¯to is able to rescue her and take Taha to the police station, but the police arrest LeÃ¯to and let Taha leave with Lola, stating that they're leaving the district. Six months later, in Paris, Damienâan undercover copâcompletes a successful operation at a casino, and is immediately given a new assignment: Taha's gang has taken a bomb from a nuclear transport vehicle and accidentally activated it, giving it 24 hours before it wipes out the district. Damien, posing as a prisoner, must infiltrate the district and disarm the bomb; he teams up with LeÃ¯to to do so. LeÃ¯to immediately sees through Damien's cover, but the two reluctantly team up to save LeÃ¯to's sister as well. The pair surrenders to Taha in order to gain access to his base, where they find the bomb has been set up on a missile launcher aimed at Paris, with Lola handcuffed to it. Taha demands a high ransom to deactivate the bomb; the government refuses, but after Damien gives them Taha's bank account codes, they drain his funds.

There are about 300 radicals and 100 are in common use. Creating a new character by modifying the radical is an easy way to disambiguate homographs among xíngshēngzì pictophonetic compounds. This practice began long before the standardization of Chinese script by Qin Shi Huang and continues to the present day. The traditional 3rd-person pronoun tā (他 \\"he, she, it\\"), which is written with the \\"person radical\\", illustrates modifying significs to form new characters.

Article: Sports shoes that work out whether their owner has done enough exercise to promise time in front of the television have been devised in the UK. The shoes- named Square Eyes- contain an electronic pressure sensor and a tiny computer chip to record how many steps the wearer has taken in a day. A wireless transmitter   passes the information to a receiver connected to a television, and this decides how much evening viewing time the wearer deserves , based on the day's efforts. The design was inspired by a desire to fight against the rapidly ballooning waistlines among British teenagers, says Gillian Swan, who developed Square Eyes as a final year design project at Brunel University in London, UK. \\"We looked at current issues and childhood overweight really stood out,\\" she says. \\"And I wanted to tackle that with my design.\\" Once a child has used up their daily allowance gained through exercise, the television automatically   switches off. And further time in front of the TV can only be earned through more steps. Swan calculated how exercise should translate to television time using the recommended daily amounts of both. Health experts suggest that a child take 12,000 steps each day and watch no more than two hours of television. So, every 100 steps recorded by the Square Eyes shoes equals exactly one minute of TV time. Existing pedometers  normally clip onto a belt or slip into a pocket and keep count of steps by measuring sudden movement. Swan says these can be easily tricked into recording steps through shaking. But her shoe has been built to be harder for lazy teenagers to cheat. \\"It is possible, but it would be a lot of effort,\\" she says. \\"That was one of my main design considerations.\\" Question: According to Swan, the purpose of her design project is to   _  .

Article: More and more birds are flying to settle at Qinghai Lake, one of the highest inland lakes in China, thanks to the protection efforts of local governments. Covering an area of over 4,000 square kilometers, Qinghai Lake is also the country's biggest salt-water lake. Located in Northwest China's Qinghai Province, the lake is famous for the two islands at its northwest point--Cormorant Island and Egg Island. The two islands have plenty of floating grass and various schools of fish, offering rich food sources for birds. The islands have become a paradise for different kinds of groups of birds and have been called 'Bird Islands'. Each March and April, when ice and snow covering the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau starts to melt, over 20 kinds of birds fly to the Bird Islands to lay eggs. During the months, flocks of birds cover the whole sky over the islands and birds eggs can be found everywhere. Visitors can hear the singing of birds from miles away. These have become a world famous symbol of the lake. To protect this paradise for birds and support calls for ecological protection, China set up the Qinghai Lake Natural Protection Zone at the end of 1997. Meanwhile, the State has pointed out the Bird Islands and Spring Bay of the Qinghai Lake as central protection zones. Inspection officials and management employees often patrol the lake, improving local residents' knowledge of related laws and spreading knowledge about animal protection to visitors. They are making great efforts to call on people to love and protect the birds. At the same time, they have built special fences around the island area, to prevent wolves, foxes and other carnivorous animals, as well as illegal hunters from breaking up the birds' nest-building, egg-laying and breeding. As a result, more and more birds are coming to the islands for sheltering and breeding. Question: Why are more and more birds coming to the biggest salt-water lake in the Great Northwest?

Write a title for this article: LONDON — The topsy-turvy politics of Britain’s endlessly unpredictable summer took another stunning twist on Monday, with the selection by default of a prime minister who had advocated staying in the European Union but will now come under immediate pressure to fulfill her promise to lead the nation’s exit. Theresa May, the hard-charging home affairs secretary, was elevated to Britain’s top job when the woman who was to spend the summer campaigning against her, Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, preemptively dropped out of the contest to succeed outgoing leader David Cameron. With only one candidate left in the race, the 59-year-old May was named the winner by acclaim, a decision met with table-thumping approval by her fellow Tories in Parliament. She will take the keys to 10 Downing Street on Wednesday, once Cameron has had a final turn in the weekly political combat session known as Prime Minister’s Questions. By coalescing around May, her Conservative Party avoided what could have been a bruising months-long campaign that threatened to inflame the still-raw wounds of last month’s E.U. referendum. But the move is also likely to accelerate the pressure on Britain to exit the E.U. European leaders have said Britain must act as quickly as possible to get out, as have Leadsom and other British advocates for a geopolitics-rattling divorce known as Brexit. On Wednesday, Theresa May will become Britain’s next prime minister. She'll become the second female British prime minister after Margaret Thatcher. Here's what you need to know her in 60 seconds. (Karla Adam,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) May campaigned — if only barely — for the country to stay inside the E.U. But after the “leave” campaign won last month’s referendum and forced the pro-“remain” Cameron from office, May pivoted and said she would back an exit — a stance she reiterated in her victory speech. “Brexit means Brexit, and we are going to make a success of it,” she said Monday afternoon as she stood in front of the gothic towers of Westminster and flashed a smile that is seldom seen on a politician known for her no-nonsense demeanor. [As Britain looks to new leader, a jolt of pressure to speed Brexit] May will become the country’s 76th prime minister, but only the second woman to hold the job following Margaret Thatcher, who stepped down over a quarter-century ago. Although May has been occasionally likened to Thatcher — Britain’s Iron Lady — she has lately been compared to a more contemporary leader: German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Both May and Merkel were born in the 1950s, the daughters of church pastors. They both inhabit the center-right of European politics but are also known for a strong pragmatic streak. Both are also considered tough negotiators — skills they’ll be putting to use against one another as May seeks a divorce deal with her soon-to-be-former E.U. counterparts. The key question now is when she triggers the start of those talks. She had earlier said she did not want to invoke Article 50 — the never-before-used mechanism for exiting the E.U. — until at least 2017. Her reluctance to move faster has sparked speculation that she might try to find a way to avoid Brexit — a possibility she emphatically rejected Monday, saying that there would be “no attempts to remain inside the E.U., no attempts to rejoin it by the back door, and no second referendum.” Monday’s events make it less likely that she can go back on that pledge, even if she wants to. In dropping out of the race, Leadsom emphasized that she was trying to clear a path for her erstwhile rival to get on with the business of Brexit. The two were supposed to campaign through the summer for the affection of the Conservative Party’s 150,000 members, with the winner due to be announced Sept. 9. [Meet Theresa May on her way to 10 Downing Street] But Leadsom, a relative unknown whose campaign got off to a rocky start after she touted her motherhood as an advantage in a matchup with the childless May, said Monday that she had concluded that “a nine-week leadership campaign at such a critical moment for our country is highly undesirable.” “Business needs certainty,” she said as she stood in front of a dark-brick townhouse in central London. Just last week, Leadsom had earned the right to square off against May in the summer contest by placing second — far behind May — among Conservative members of Parliament. May was considered a strong favorite to win, but Leadsom had vowed to wage a tough campaign. Her decision to drop out came as yet another shock in a country where such remarkable turnabouts have become a regular feature of politics. Since voting last month to leave the E.U. — the biggest stunner of all — Britain has watched mouth agape as politicians have double-crossed each other, scores have been settled and May has emerged from near the back of the pack of prime ministerial candidates to be the only woman left standing. By dropping out, Leadsom triggered a cascade of fast-moving developments. First, May’s former rivals lined up behind her. Michael Gove, the justice secretary who finished third in last week’s winnowing of candidates, quickly endorsed May on Monday. So did Boris Johnson, the former London mayor and a one-time Leadsom backer. Hours later, Cameron walked out the front door of 10 Downing Street for one of the last times, and announced to reporters that he would yield to May by Wednesday. “I’m delighted that Theresa May will be the next prime minister. She is strong, she is competent, she is more than able to provide the leadership that our country is going to need in the years ahead, and she will have my full support,” Cameron said. Cameron said he would chair his last cabinet meeting Tuesday and would attend Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday for a final time as the nation’s leader, six years after he took the job. “After that, I expect to go to the palace and offer my resignation, so we will have a new prime minister in that building behind me by Wednesday evening,” he said. On his way back to Downing Street, the still-mic’d-up Cameron hummed a happy tune. A little over an hour later, in brief remarks beside cheering Conservative lawmakers outside Parliament, May promised to “steer us through what will be difficult and uncertain political and economic times.” May, who had raced back to London after a campaign event in Birmingham, appeared to have been caught off guard by Leadsom’s withdrawal — as was nearly everyone in British politics. [The rise of Theresa May highlights Brexit’s greatest irony] May will take office under the mandate that the Conservative Party gained in last year’s general election, having won a narrow majority in Parliament. But the abrupt end of the leadership contest deprives her of the explicit endorsement she was expected to receive from the party’s rank-and-file members. May had earlier said she believed that it was important that the party have a choice in its new leader and that she not take power through “a coronation.” Opposition parties quickly seized on the fact that voters hadn’t had the chance to pick May. The veteran politician is considered to the right of Cameron, having taken a hard line on issues such as immigration and government surveillance. “Tories now have no mandate,” tweeted Tim Farron, leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats, in a call for new elections. “Britain deserves better than this.” Politicians from the center-left Labour Party joined Farron’s call. But they did so as Labour continued its weeks-long implosion. Angela Eagle, a former top deputy of party leader Jeremy Corbyn, announced Monday that she would challenge Corbyn for his job. Dissidents within Labour, including Eagle, say Corbyn is ill-equipped to lead the party in a general election if the Conservatives decide to call one to renew their mandate. May has said there will be no new vote. But in a season of constant surprise, British political observers say not to rule it out.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY or others will want what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, wanting is a postcondition desire on the part of PersonY and others, respectively. For example, as a result of PersonX giving PersonY gifts, PersonY may want to open the gift.

Answer options: \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" Solution: - Analyzing the Head: PersonX asks PersonX's mother for help. PersonY is not explicitly mentioned, but the mother can be considered PersonY in this context. - Analyzing the Tail: rejected - We need to determine if PersonY (PersonX's mother) will want to reject as a result of being asked for help. After analyzing the task, it seems unlikely that PersonY (PersonX's mother) would want to reject just because they are asked for help.

The speaker expresses disbelief and excitement (\\"oh my gosh\\") at someone having accomplished a certain task or feat, suggesting that it is an uncommon or challenging achievement. Following that sentiment, the speaker proceeds to provide further context and support – stating that there are \\"so many people who have never even gotten to do that.\\" This implies that the majority of those involved in comparable situations or environments have been unsuccessful or unable to accomplish the same goal. Additionally, the speaker adds credibility to their statement with an anecdote about their sister, who was also discussing the same observation. While an anecdote can sometimes be anecdotal evidence and not as reliable as scientific or empirical data, it can still provide personal, real-life experience and examples to solidify this observation in a conversational setting. Considering the information provided in the premise, we can derive that the hypothesis \\"Not many people have achieved that\\" is entailed by it. Both the sentiment behind the speaker's astonishment and the reference to the large number of people who haven't accomplished the task support the hypothesis. The mention of the sister's testimony – sharing the same observation – also serves to back up the hypothesis. In conclusion, based on the premise provided, we can confidently state that it entails the hypothesis that not many people have achieved the mentioned accomplishment.

I thought \\"What's New Scooby-Doo\\" was pretty bad (yes, I'm sorry to say I didn't like it), since Hanna-Barbera didn't produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series. When I heard \\"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue\\" was in the works, I thought it could be better. But when I saw a pic of how Scooby and Shaggy were going to appear, I knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. I watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just yet another \\"Teen Titans\\" or \\"Loonatics Unleashed\\"-wannabe. No longer are Scooby and Shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. Now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo have become more brave, too. Also, since Shaggy IS NOT going to be a vegetarian in this series, Casey Kasem (whom actually IS a vegetarian), the original voice of Shaggy, will NOT voice Shaggy. He will only voice Shaggy if he doesn't eat meat, and that was just a stupid corporate-done change to update the franchise, as if the Internet jokes weren't enough. So Scott Menville (whom previously voiced Red Herring on \\"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\\") voices Shaggy here. Believe me, the voice is REALLY BAD! It makes Shaggy sound like a squeaky 10-year-old, and I must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look. However, Kasem DOES voice Shaggy's Uncle Albert, which is a sort of good thing. Scooby-Doo, on the other hand, does not look that well. He seems to have been designed to look more like the CGI Scooby-Doo from the live-action movies. Also, Scooby's Frank Welker voice (need I mention Brain the Dog again?) still hasn't improved. Robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than Scrappy-Doo! He tries to be funny and does \\"comical\\" impressions and gives safety tips (\\"Remember kids, don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm!\\"), but it just doesn't fit into a Scooby-Doo cartoon. Again, the Hanna-Barbera sound effects are rarely used here. However, on one episode, \\"Lightning Strikes Twice,\\" they use the \\"Castle thunder\\" thunderclaps during it, almost extensively! (Although they DO still use the newly-recorded thunder sound effects, too.) Scooby-Doo hasn't use \\"Castle thunder\\" sound effects since 1991. But my question is, why use \\"Castle thunder\\" on \\"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue,\\" while NOT use it on the direct-to-video movies or even on \\"What's New Scooby-Doo!\\" (Two episodes of WNSD used it, and it wasn't enough, unfortunately.) If WNSD and the DTV movies used it, then they might be better than this crappy cartoon. The day this show premiered, I watched the first episode, and it was SO bad I turned it off after only five minutes! To get my mind off of this poor show, I rented \\"Scooby-Doo, Pirates Ahoy!\\" which came out around the same time. And you know what? The \\"Pirates Ahoy\\" movie was actually BETTER than \\"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue\\" (and even better than \\"What's New, Scooby-Doo!\\") And it looks like the new designs that the characters have isn't permanent to the franchise. The direct-to-video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs, thankfully. But, whether you loved or hated \\"What's New Scooby-Doo,\\" I don't recommend it.

However, there are concerns about the high adult admission fee, with about half of the population considering the price of HK 250 to HK 300 (US 32 to US 38) too expensive. Despite these concerns, people like Mrs. Yu, the mother of a young boy, appreciate the opportunity to experience a Disney Park in their own country, comparing the admission fee to the much more significant cost of an air ticket to the USA. While not everyone may be thrilled about the high admission fee, the overall sentiment appears to be positive towards the plan to build a Disney Park in Hong Kong. It is important to note that the question asked in the prompt is whether the answer is \\"Most of them agree with it.\\" With over 80% of the population expressing interest in visiting the park upon its opening, it can be concluded that most Hong Kong people do agree with the plan to build a Disney Park in their city. Furthermore, people like Mrs. Yu and Chan Posang, a 12-year-old girl, are already considering ways to budget and save for the admission fee. This implies that, despite the high cost, many individuals still find value in having a local Disney Park. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the article and the strong interest from the majority of Hong Kong's population, it can be substantiated that most of them agree with the plan to build a Disney Park in Hong Kong. While concerns regarding the high admission fee persist, the excitement and anticipation for the park's opening, as well as the potential positive impact on the local economy, are strong enough to indicate an overall positive outlook on the project from Hong Kong people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Carrera GT was going between 80mph and 93mph when Rodas lost control and crashed in a 45mph zone, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesperson said yesterday, according to NBC Los Angeles. Neither Walker nor Rodas had alcohol or drugs in their system, the spokesperson added; both were wearing seatbelts and the airbags deployed normally. Investigators also revealed that the car's exhaust system had been modified in a way that could allow it to hit higher speeds; its tires were nine years old—five years past the time the owner's manual suggests changing them, but CNN notes that the car was mostly displayed, not driven; and its left rear brake rotor was worn below manufacturer specifications, but that was determined not to have contributed to the accident. Investigators also noted that there was no evidence to support the theory that Rodas may have been racing another vehicle. Expand this summary.","output":"Following a long period of investigations pursuing the primary cause of the abrupt accident that claimed the lives of Hollywood actor Paul Walker and professional race car driver Roger Rodas in 2013, official confirmation has emerged that unsafe driving was solely to blame. There have been numerous theories and speculations circulating around, suggesting that a mechanical malfunction in the Porsche Carrera GT or poor roadway conditions may have played a significant part in the tragic incident. However, authorities have finally ruled out these assumptions, clarifying that the high-speed driving was the principal factor leading to the fatal crash. As reported by a spokesperson from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the Carrera GT, driven by Rodas, was travelling at an astounding speed of between 80mph and 93mph when he tragically lost control of the vehicle. This high-speed pursuit took place in an area demarcated as a 45mph zone, indicating that the vehicle was moving at almost double the speed limit when the crash occurred. This speed reckoning is alarming and underscores the brutality of the crash, as it depicts a glaring disregard for traffic rules and the safety measures associated with them. Another relevant assertion made by the spokesperson, as relayed by NBC Los Angeles, was that neither Walker nor Rodas were under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the accident. This essentially debunks another line of speculation suggesting substance abuse as a potential factor behind the fatal incident. It also further reinforces the assertion that the main culpability lies with the reckless, high-speed driving. Both Walker and Rodas were also found to be adhering to standard safety measures at the time of the incident. They were both wearing seatbelts, and the vehicle's airbags were reported to have functioned as they were supposed to, deploying normally upon impact. Investigators also turned their attention to the Porsche Carrera GT's mechanical condition. The car's exhaust system had been modified in a manner that would allow it to reach higher speeds. This modification suggests the possibility of deliberate attempts to facilitate high-speed driving. Furthermore, it was noted that the Carrera GT was equipped with tires that were nine years old—five years beyond the period recommended for a change in the owner's manual. It is important to note, nonetheless, that CNN reported that the vehicle was primarily displayed, barely driven, which could justify the outdated tires. Additionally, the vehicle's left rear brake rotor was found to be in a degenerated condition wherein it fell below the manufacturer's specifications. However, investigators determined that this deficiency did not contribute to the crash. Lastly, there was speculation that Rodas might have been in a race with another vehicle at the time of the crash. But investigators found no substantial evidence validating this theory. Despite various angles of speculation and examination of different potential causes, the investigators have, in conclusion, firmly imputed the high-speed driving as the single-handed reason behind the tragic accident that led to the loss of two lives."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: CONTEXT: 11 de enero de 2012 La Fundación Mozilla, tranquilizada después de llevar a cabo el acuerdo pacífico con Google, continúa presentando novedades del navegador Firefox pese al rápido ciclo de actualizaciones. Por primera vez, se lanzará a finales de enero una nueva versión ESR (siglas en inglés de Extended Support Release) que tendrá una duración de casi un año dedicada a los sectores empresariales u organizaciones que quieren ponerse al tanto de la seguridad y comodidad. Según comenta, Jay Sullivan, colaborador en el proyecto Mozilla Enterprise User Working Group, en su blog que las \\"actualizaciones llegarán una vez al año, asegurando así las entregas de seguridad para los navegadores de las empresas pero sin hacer tantos cambios en la Web o en la plataforma de Add-ons\\". La versión que aplicarán los desarrolladores será en la versión 10, que sería lanzada el 31 de enero. Durante ese tiempo deberán migrar los usuarios de la denominada y famosa 3.6, que dejará de ser estable en las próximas semanas. En este caso, tanto el normal (para usuarios comunes) como la extendida seguirán siendo disponibles. Tal y como menciona la wiki de Mozilla, la versión extendida tendrá una duración de 54 semanas teniendo cierta similitud con las versiones LTS del sistema operativo Ubuntu. Para evitar complicaciones, los canales regulares no se interferirán y seguirán siendo los mismos. Por ejemplo, si una versión (10) es lanzada como estable y a la vez es etiquetada como ESR, tendrá dos ciclos: la primera considerada como \\"periodo de calidad\\" que se aplicará para las revisiones criticas de las versiones (10.0.1). Durante ese tiempo se aprovechará a las instituciones emigrar durante tres meses. Pasadas unas semanas, se cambiará al \\"periodo de soporte\\" bajo el apoyo del proyecto; durante varios lanzamientos menores (10.0.2, 10.0.3, ...), este continuará siendo estable y no tendrá cambios idénticos a las \\"versiones normales\\". En cambio, las posteriores consideradas como \\"normales\\" (es decir que no sean ESR) dejarán de dar soporte a favor de otro de manera sucesiva cada mes y medio (del 11 al 16), así hasta que se lance una versión etiquetada como ESR (que sería en el 2013) ofreciendo pequeñas actualizaciones importantes mediante el \\"periodo de calidad\\" y ofrecerá un máximo de 6 semanas para quedarse a ésta.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are more or less ):   Barry is connecting new wires to his speakers. His new wires are thicker than the old ones, therefore, he should expect that the electrical current will display more or less resistance than his older, thinner ones? The answer is:","output":"Less resistance. The answer to the question is that Barry should expect less resistance in the electrical current with his new, thicker wires as compared to the older, thinner ones. This is because the relationship between the wire's thickness (cross-sectional area) and resistance is inversely proportional, meaning that as the cross-sectional area of the wire increases, the resistance offered by the wire decreases. The reason behind this is rooted in the basic principles of electricity and the conductive nature of materials. In a conductive material, such as the copper or aluminum that is commonly used in speaker wires, the atoms in the material have electrons in their outer electron shells that are relatively free to move. When a voltage is applied across the wire, these free electrons can move from one atom to another, creating an electric current. The resistance of a wire is primarily determined by three factors: 1. Material – Different materials have varying levels of electrical resistance. For example, copper has lower resistance than aluminum for the same given wire size, which is why copper is often preferred for electrical installations. 2. Length – The longer the wire, the greater the total number of atoms the electrons must move through, which results in higher resistance. 3. Cross-sectional area – A thicker wire has more conductive material available for electrons to move through, which reduces the resistance. So in the case of Barry's new thicker speaker wires, the increased cross-sectional area provides more pathways for electrons to flow through, effectively reducing the resistance offered by the wire. As a result, Barry should expect less resistance in the electrical current with his new, thicker wires compared to his older and thinner ones, leading to a potentially clearer and more efficient signal transmission between his audio system and speakers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control.

Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill  it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will not get into trouble. The answer is:","output":"Question: According to the article, what are the two main rules for driving safely on icy roads during winter? A.

Speed up on icy roads and stay in a single lane Answer: B. Drive smoothly and pay attention to what might happen Justification: According to the article, Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. This is suggested because sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. To ensure safety, one should aim to drive as gently and slowly as possible, as if not wanting to spill a full cup of hot coffee seated next to them. Rule Number Two mentioned in the article is to pay attention to what might happen. The article advises looking further down the road as more ice is present, and adjusting the stopping distance depending on road conditions (double on wet roads, triple on snow, and even more on ice).

FERGUSON, Mo. — Just up the road from the memorial of stuffed animals and candles that has become a place of pilgrimage and protest over the shooting death of Michael Brown, there is an empty parking lot where another young black man was killed last week on the night this city erupted in rage.      There are no rallies or news cameras there, no signs or ribbons to mark the spot where, the police say, Deandre Joshua, 20, was shot once in the head and then set on fire inside his car. He was the only person killed during the fires, looting and riots that shook the city after a grand jury declined to indict a white police officer in Mr. Brown’s killing. But in the days since, Mr. Joshua’s death has largely become a footnote to Ferguson’s story — an open homicide case and a bitter mystery for his family.      “The unknown is what scares me,” his mother, Maria, 39, said in an interview at her home in nearby University City, where her son and his identical twin brother, Dont’A (Don-TAY), shared the basement. “I don’t know what happened to him.”      The police have offered few details about the killing. Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police suggested last week that there could be “a nexus” between the broader unrest and Mr. Joshua’s death, but a police spokesman said it remained unclear whether there was any direct link. The police have not named any suspects, and have said it was unclear precisely when Mr. Joshua was killed or why his body was burned. ||||| Close Get email notifications on Joel Currier daily!

Please briefly summarize this news article: Rep. Charles Rangel reflects on his censure and his legacy After it was all over - the bear hugs, the whispers, the somber theatricality - one question lingered about Charlie Rangel's censure, and it was wider than Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard in Harlem. How did the savvy old pol let this happen? How did one of the shrewdest operatives in the House of Representatives, a man who rose to become chairman of the most powerful committee, Ways and Means, an expert in tax law and spending procedures, a hero to black America, get caught chiseling on his taxes? How did he let himself become the latest example of ethical lapses in Congress? Weeks after he was censured by the House - a rebuke suffered by only 22 others in congressional history - Rangel, 80, sat for two interviews in his Capitol Hill office. Reviewing the events of the past two years, his answers were full of contradictions that seem to defy easy explanation. He doesn't bother to conceal his rage and lashes out, in that deep Orson Welles voice, in many directions: He admits he made mistakes, but also lays blame upon a conservative ethics group and their efforts to expose him. He fingers a former chief of staff who he says didn't pay attention to details. And he laments a political climate in which veteran members of Congress are treated like the amateur performers at Harlem's Apollo Theater (which Rangel helped save from extinction), their fate dependent on the whim of the audience. \\"Nothing I did was inconsistent with what I thought was legal. It wasn't done in the dark of night!\\" The voice is roaring away, yelling indiscriminately at everyone in the room. He begins riffling through papers on his desk as if a document or folder might include the magic of belated redemption. \\"If there's no corruption, then the corruption shouldn't have been an issue,\\" said Rangel, who served on the Judiciary Committee during the impeachment hearings against President Richard Nixon. \\"Nobody's been censured when there hasn't involved the breaking of any laws.\\" The ethics committee, chaired by Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), concluded that Rangel had not paid taxes for 17 years on property he owns in the Dominican Republic, where he sometimes vacations. It said he raised \\"millions\\" of dollars for the Rangel Center at City College of New York from corporations that did business before his Ways and Means Committee. And it concluded that he had accumulated more than 500,000 in undisclosed financial assets. While taking blame for what he termed \\"overzealousness\\" in fundraising, Rangel chided members of Congress who voted for censure instead of a less serious reprimand, howled about a double standard, vowed that this episode \\"is not over yet\\" and complained bitterly about the National Legal and Policy Center, a Falls Church-based organization that chases after public officials who may have ethics issues. \\"For a chairman to violate House rules, well, I don't feel good about that,\\" he said. \\"If it was done because I relied on my chief of staff, George Dalley, a Columbia Law School graduate, smart man, well, again, I do feel bad. But I didn't get a nickel!\\" Rangel repeatedly mentioned people who have expressed support for him or minimized the import of the ethics violations. He recounted a train ride from Manhattan to Washington earlier that day, replete with the familiar pats on the back and warm handshakes. \\"Henry Kissinger grabbed me on the train . . . and said, 'You got a bum deal. You're still my congressman.' He asked me: 'Why did they vote against you?' And all I could say was: 'Congress is held in such low esteem!' \\" He likes this theme of Congress and public perception. \\"Representatives didn't want to look soft on corruption - even if it wasn't corruption!\\" he said. He's started combing his hair. He's at the refrigerator grabbing a 32-ounce bottle of soda and taking a swallow. \\"I think the reputation of Congress is so low that to vote for me would have been seen as being soft on crime. Soft on misconduct.\\" Summary:","output":"This article discusses Representative Charles Rangel's reflections on his censure and his legacy.

UPDATED:. 07:12 EST, 3 May 2013. Little Ireland Nugent's parents have been trying to tell her their 2-year-old daughter that her legs have been amputated but they're having a hard time. Three weeks ago, an horrific lawn-mower accident in Palm Harbor, Florida severed both of her legs below the knees. Her mother Nicole Nugent told the Tampa Bay Times that they were trying to find the words in the the hope that she would understand. Scroll down for video... Still my little girl: Jerry Nugent hugs his daughter, Ireland, in a Florida hospital. Just three weeks ago he accidentally cut off his daughters' legs after running her over with his lawnmower. Brave: Ireland's legs were severed below the knees and she had cuts to her hand. She also broke her thumb. Brave: Her parents are adament that their little girl, Ireland, will walk again. 'We were playing with Mr. Potato Head yesterday and taking the feet on and off and I said, 'This is going to be like you, Ireland. We're going to take your feet on and off.' She doesn't really understand. She's honestly so little that I don't really think she gets that.' Brave Ireland has asked virtually no questions about the past, but her parents worry about what is to come. So far she's already had to undergo seven operations and now her parents, Jerry and Nicole are looking into prosthetic-limb providers and group therapy for themselves and their other children. Incredibly, Ireland is managing to smile through it all and is keeping far calmer than her parents. Simplicity: Ireland's mom, Nicole, is trying to get her daughter used to the idea of prosthetic leg. She told her that she was going to be like Mr Potatohead. Harrowing ordeal: Ireland, seen here in her hospital bed, has had to undergo seven surgeries since her accident three weeks ago. She is heavily drugged-up with pain medication and one of her arms is in cast. However, when media were allowed to visit the girl for the first time yesterday, they reported that Ireland appeared to be awake, alert and full of curiosity with her cheeks sporting a healthy glow. She was given a package of Play-doh and animal-shaped cookie cutters. It's Ireland's smile that helps strengthen her family. 'She's just happy and spunky and it keeps us going,' her mom, Nicole said. 'She's been very strong through this whole process. In fact, it's been hard for us to even read that she's in pain at times. I kind of have to read her physical cues because she just doesn't cry.' On Tuesday, her dad said that he was rubbing the ends of his daughter's legs. The idea was to alleviate the 'phantom limb' sensations that trouble many amputees. 'I love your little legs,' he told her. 'Thank you, daddy,' she replied. Comforting: The family are trying to make things as normal as possible for the little girl, even while she is still in hospital. Support: The family say the support from the community has been overwhelming. Her hospital room is awash with cards, toys and balloons. Support: Ireland Nugent's mom and dad have been with her every day since the accident on April 11th. The little girl was injured on April 11th when she ran after her father, Jerry, as he rode a lawn mower up the driveway at their Palm Harbor home. Her mother, Nicole, frantically waved at him to stop, but he misunderstood and put the lawn mower in reverse backing over his child. Both her legs were severed below the knee. Her hand was also cut and her thumb broken. The Nugents say the financial and moral support they've received from the community has been overwhelming. Balloons, toys, and cards fill her hospital room. A fund established for Ireland's medical care and expenses at Trinity Presbyterian had raised about 85,000 and the family are continuing to raise money. Bright future: Doctors plan to fit the toddler with prosthetic legs in a few weeks once her wounds dry and heal. The family is already making plans to have Ireland fitted for prosthetic limbs in Orlando. Two funds have been set up to accept donations for Ireland Nugent's family. •. Trinity Presbyterian Church: Checks can be made out to 'Trinity. Presbyterian Foundation' (with 'Ireland Nugent' on the memo line) and. sent to Trinity Presbyterian Church, 2001 Rainbow Drive, Clearwater, FL. 33765. Or donate by credit card online: trinityclearwater.org. •. The Pinellas County government has arranged for a special fund through. Pinellas Federal Credit Union in Ireland Nugent's name. Find details. online at pinellasfcu.org or call (727) 586-4422. Her mother says she and her husband are looking towards the future and working out how they will cope when Ireland returns home. They will have to make adjustments to the family home in order to make life as easy as possible for the little girl. Her siblings may also need some counseling as they adjust to life without Ireland's legs. Later today, doctors will do a final check of two skin grafts to make sure they've healed. If they have it would mean Ireland is one step closer to coming home. Her mother told WSTP: 'This has been the biggest nightmare of my life, honestly. I never imagined that this would happen to her, but through this have come so many blessings,' Nicole says. 'First, she lived, and we didn't know when it first happened if that was going to happen.' Ireland's father agrees. 'When I see her, it's just like a weight is lifted and I know she's there and she's going to be okay.'","output":"In a tragic accident in Palm Harbor, Florida, 2-year-old Ireland Nugent had both her legs amputated below the knees following a horrific lawn-mower accident.

Logan had to remind Benjamin to take the medicine because Benjamin was very bad with keeping track of schedules. Despite being an intelligent and capable individual, Benjamin found it difficult to manage his day-to-day tasks effectively. This had been a consistent issue for him throughout his life as he often forgot important deadlines, missed appointments, and even misplaced essential items. Logan, on the other hand, was highly organized and meticulous when it came to planning and time management. She was exceptionally skilled at balancing work, personal life, and self-care. As such, she could easily remember important dates and appointments without breaking a sweat. Moreover, Logan understood the importance of consistency, particularly when it came to health-related routines, such as medication management. That's why, realizing that Benjamin could easily fall into a pattern of neglecting his medicine regime, she took it upon herself to remind him to take his medicine whenever needed. Logan's efforts were motivated by her genuine concern for Benjamin's well-being. She knew that in order for him to maintain his health, it was crucial to adhere to the prescribed medication schedule. In order to help Benjamin improve his time management, Logan suggested that he start using a planner or calendar. She also recommended setting reminders on his phone, or even using a smart speaker that could be programmed with alarms for his medicine. She believed that with the right tools and some determination, Benjamin could eventually become more organized and efficient when it came to managing his schedule. To further assist Benjamin, Logan offered to periodically check in with him to ensure that he was making progress. She wanted to show her support and provide encouragement in his journey towards better organizational skills. With time, Logan hoped that these efforts would become less necessary as Benjamin developed a routine, but for now, she was dedicated to helping her friend overcome his challenges. To Logan, this minor act of kindness was really just an extension of their friendship. She cared for Benjamin deeply and wanted him to succeed in all aspects of life. It was not without its challenges, as Benjamin occasionally resisted her help and preferred to try to manage things on his own. However, Logan's persistence and continued support eventually led to a positive change in Benjamin's habits. In the end, Benjamin learned the value of time management and prioritizing tasks, and he also discovered the importance of maintaining a consistent medicine regimen. Thanks to Logan's unwavering support and assistance, he was able to overcome his scheduling deficiencies and lead a happier, healthier, and more organized life. And through this experience, their bond as friends only grew stronger, as they both came to appreciate and rely on one another in new ways."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence in the Japanese, provide an equivalent translation in Filipino that retains the same meaning through the translation.

Question: Of the first team players that were offloaded by Watford, who had the longest career? Passage 1:The Green Hornet was adapted into two movie serials, 1940's The Green Hornet and, in 1941, The Green Hornet Strikes Again! Disliking the treatment Republic gave The Lone Ranger in two serials, George W. Trendle took his property to Universal Pictures, and was much happier with the results. The first serial, titled simply The Green Hornet (1940), starred Gordon Jones in the title role, albeit dubbed by original radio Hornet Al Hodge whenever the hero's mask was in place, while The Green Hornet Strikes Again! (1941) starred Warren Hull. Keye Luke, who played the \\"Number One Son\\" in the Charlie Chan films, played Kato in both. Also starring in both serials were Anne Nagel as Lenore Case, Britt Reid's secretary, and Wade Boteler as Mike Axford, a reporter for the Daily Sentinel, the newspaper that Reid owned and published. Ford Beebe directed both serials, partnered by Ray Taylor on The Green Hornet and John Rawlins on The Green Hornet Strikes Again!, with George H. Plympton and Basil Dickey contributing to the screenplays for both serials. The Green Hornet ran for 13 chapters while The Green Hornet Strikes Again! had 15 installments, with the Hornet and Kato smashing a different racket in each chapter. In each serial, they were all linked to a single major crime syndicate which was itself put out of business in the finale, while the radio program had the various rackets completely independent of each other.  Passage 2:In 1954, he returned to California and signed with 4-Star Publishing as a songwriter and demo tape recorder. Patsy Cline recorded his \\"Turn the Cards Slowly\\" for a minor hit. Interested in furthering his chances at a successful career in rockabilly, Masters recorded \\"Pink Cadillac\\" and \\"Whop-T-Bop\\" with guitarist Jimmy Bryant and released them on 4-Star in 1956, but neither sold well. Follow-ups \\"Angel\\" and \\"Jodie\\" were no more successful, even after Masters's touring schedule and television appearances on The Jack Benny Show and Town Hall Party. His contract with 4-Star ended in 1957, and he wrote for American Music for a few years. \\"Rockin' Red Wing\\" was issued on Warner Bros. Records in September 1959 before signing with Lode Records in 1960. Lode re-issued \\"Rockin' Red Wing\\" in January that year, which became a regional hit in Los Angeles and eventually reached No. 64 on the Billboard Hot 100. It gave Masters his only appearance in the UK Singles Chart when it peaked at No. 36 in June 1960. His next single, \\"Golden Slippers\\", was released nationally by Dot Records, but it was not a success, and neither was \\"Pierre the Poodle\\", his last release before losing his recording contract.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Have you ever had the strange feeling that you were being watched? You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you! Parapsychologists   say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a \\"sixth sense\\" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments. In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them. For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed. Baker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they're being stared at. If people doubt the outcome of his two experiments, said baker, \\"I suggest they repeat the experiments and see for themselves.\\" Question: The purpose of the two experiments is to  _  .

Question: Why are people allowed to worship anything they like in America? Context: The first amendment to the US Constitution states \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\\" The two parts, known as the \\"establishment clause\\" and the \\"free exercise clause\\" respectively, form the textual basis for the Supreme Court's interpretations of the \\"separation of church and state\\" doctrine. Three central concepts were derived from the 1st Amendment which became America's doctrine for church-state separation: no coercion in religious matters, no expectation to support a religion against one's will, and religious liberty encompasses all religions. In sum, citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith, any support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary, and all religions are equal in the eyes of the law with no special preference or favoritism. Answer:","output":"People are allowed to worship anything they like in America because the First Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees religious freedoms through the \\"establishment clause\\" and the \\"free exercise clause.\\" These clauses form the basis for the Supreme Court's interpretations of the \\"separation of church and state\\" doctrine, which ensures no coercion in religious matters, no expectation to support a religion against one's will, and that religious liberty encompasses all religions.

Explanation: Comparing the textual similarity to the original sentence, the generated one maintains certain key elements but forms its own unique context. Both sentences discuss the same event, i.e., the building collapse in Bangladesh and the subsequent arrests, hence maintaining the subject similarity. However, the way they refer to the incident is different. The original sentence uses \\"deadly\\", signifying fatalities, while the regenerated phrase uses the term \\"hazardous\\" which may refer to the dangerous conditions but does not explicitly highlight the death toll.

When we're hungry, we eat at home instead of going out. We take buses instead of taxis. And we wear our old designer jeans just a few months longer. With college expenses at all-time highs, high school students are eager to do anything to cut the cost of a university education. One cost-cutting proposal is to allow college students to get a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four. Educational institutions have been actively exploring ways to make the learning process more efficient. But there's a question: Would the quality of undergraduate education suffer? Few US universities have formally approved a \\"three-year degree\\" model. I doubt that mainstream North American colleges will carry out a three-year curriculum   any time soon. For one thing, most universities already allow highly qualified students to graduate early by testing out of certain classes and obtaining a number of college credits. In addition, at famous universities, the committee who determine which courses are required and which courses are electives are unlikely to suddenly \\"throw out\\" one quarter of the required credits. Professors will resist \\"diluting  \\" the quality of the education they offer. In my opinion, a quality four-year education is always superior to a quality three-year education. A college education requires sufficient time for a student to become skilled in their major and do coursework in fields outside their major. It is not a good idea to water down education, any more than it's not a good idea to water down medicine. If we want to help students find their way through university, we should help them understand early on what knowledge and skills they need to have upon graduation. We should allow students to test out of as many courses as possible. We should give them a chance to earn money as interns   in meaningful part-time jobs that relate to their university studies, such as the five-year co-op program at Northeastern University. ks5uks5u Question: In most US universities,  _  . - college students are offered the co-op program - electives' credits make up one quarter of the required credits - all students are required to finish four-year education before graduation - some excellent students can graduate ahead of time Answer:","output":"In most US universities, some excellent students can graduate ahead of time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1841, Solomon Northup is a free African-American man working as a violinist, living with his wife and two children in Saratoga Springs, New York. Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to Washington, D.C. However, once they arrive they drug Northup and deliver him to a slave pen run by a man named Burch. Northup proclaims that he is a free man, only to be savagely beaten with a wooden paddle and then a leather belt. Northup is later shipped to New Orleans along with other captive African Americans. He is told by the others that if he wants to survive in the South, he must adapt to being a slave and not tell anyone he is a free man. A slave trader named Theophilus Freeman gives Northup the identity of \\"Platt\\", a runaway slave from Georgia, and sells him to plantation owner William Ford. Ford takes a liking to Northup and gives him a violin. However, tension grows between Northup and plantation carpenter John Tibeats which ends with Northup savagely beating and whipping Tibeats.

It tells the story of how their paths cross when Clare's father accidentally shoots Henry, causing a series of events that alter their lives forever. The incident unveils interconnected mysteries involving time travel, betrayal, and family secrets that, once unraveled, change the perspectives of the central characters. Act 1: Henry is a journalist working on an investigative report about a mysterious time traveler who may hold secrets to the town's missing persons. Clare, a talented artist, lives a privileged life under her overbearing father's shadow. She longs to break free and pursue her dreams without her family's wealth. Act 2: During one of his investigations, Henry stumbles upon an old journal belonging to a man named Robert, who claims to have time-traveled and foreseen critical events, including the incident of Clare's father accidentally shooting Henry. When Clare's father, a renowned inventor, mistakens Henry for an intruder and shoots him, Henry survives but is left in a coma. Act 3: In her search for answers, Clare discovers her father's secret lab, where he's been working on a time-travel machine. It turns out her father is Robert—the time traveler from the journal. In an attempt to change her father's ways, Clare decides to go back in time with intentions of preventing the incident and gaining her own independence. Act 4: Landing in the past, Clare encounters a younger Robert and realizes the root of her father's obsession with time travel—his wife's (Clare's mother) tragic death in a car accident. Seeing an opportunity to change the course of their lives, Clare saves her mother, preventing her death. Act 5: As the timeline shifts, Clare returns to the present, finding her family changed and happier. However, she realizes that, unintentionally, her actions created a ripple effect, changing Henry's fate as well. Instead of being a journalist shot by her father, Henry is now a police officer, one who investigates her father's illegal activities tied to his inventions. Together, they expose Clare's father's secrets, and he is arrested. Epilogue: With her father facing the consequences of his actions, Clare is liberated and moves on to explore her dreams as an independent woman. Henry, realizing the intertwining nature of their lives, resigns from the force, and uncovers his passion for journalism again. As their paths cross in a new light, Clare and Henry come together with an unspoken bond, knowing the unique experiences they had been through. Thus, their incredible journey transcends the challenges of time and forges a bond that echoes across the ever-changing multiverse."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas,  and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the  ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible  to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions   were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the...

Please answer the following question: Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes.

A:","output":"Within the passage you provided, the answer to the question \\"what were the super powers' wants?\\" can be inferred. The superpowers, which include the Dutch and British colonial governments, desired to acquire and maintain control over Southeast Asian colonies for the extraction of their vast resources and the exploitation of their large markets. By dissolving both the Dutch East India Company and the British East India Company, the respective governments aimed to establish direct administration over the colonies to better capitalize on the potential profits from resources and markets in the region. In doing so, colonial rule heavily impacted Southeast Asia's development, with both positive and negative effects. The superpowers profited significantly, creating wealth and expanding their realms of influence. However, it must be noted that while this exploitation perhaps led to the development of the region to a certain extent, it also had economic, social, and political ramifications for the Southeast Asian colonies. In summary, the super powers' wants primarily revolved around asserting control over Southeast Asian colonies to extract resources, exploit markets, and expand their influence, which indirectly led to varying degrees of regional development."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

A fourth member, MC Jarobi White, left the group in 1991 after the release of their debut album. He continued to contribute to the band sporadically before rejoining for their 2006 reunion. Along with De La Soul, the group was a central part of the Native Tongues, and enjoyed the most commercial success out of all the groups to emerge from that collective. Many of their songs, such as \\"Bonita Applebum\\", \\"Can I Kick It?\\", \\"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo\\", \\"Scenario\\", \\"Check the Rhime\\", \\"Jazz (We've Got)\\", \\"Award Tour\\" and \\"Electric Relaxation\\" are considered classics. The group released six albums between 1990 and 2016. The band broke up in 1998 after releasing their fifth album. In 2006, the group reunited and toured the United States, and in 2016, they released their sixth album.  - David Louis \\"Dave\\" Bartholomew (born December 24, 1918) is an American musician, bandleader, composer, arranger and record producer, prominent in the music of New Orleans throughout the second half of the 20th century. Originally a trumpeter, he has been active in many musical genres, including rhythm and blues, big band, swing music, rock and roll, New Orleans jazz and Dixieland. He has been cited by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a key figure in the transition from jump blues and swing to R&B and as \\"one of the Crescent Citys greatest musicians and a true pioneer in the rock and roll revolution.\\"  - \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" is a 1956 hit single by Chuck Berry, originally released on Chess Records, with \\"Drifting Heart\\" as the B-side. The lyrics of the song mention rock and roll and the desire for rhythm and blues to replace classical music. The title of the song is an imperative directed at the composer Ludwig van Beethoven to roll over in his grave in reaction to the new genre of music that Berry was promoting. The song has been covered by many other artists, including the Beatles and the Electric Light Orchestra. \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine ranked it number 97 on its list of the \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\".  - Average White Band (also AWB) are a Scottish funk and R&B band that had a series of soul and disco hits between 1974 and 1980. They are best known for their million-selling instrumental track \\"Pick Up the Pieces\\", and their albums \\"AWB\\" and \\"Cut the Cake\\". The band name was initially proposed by Bonnie Bramlett. They have influenced others such as the Brand New Heavies, and been sampled by various musicians including the Beastie Boys, TLC, The Beatnuts, Too Short, Ice Cube, Eric B. & Rakim, Nas, and A Tribe Called Quest, as well as Arrested Development  making them the 15th most sampled act in history. As of 2016, 40 years after their formation, they continue to perform.  - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds.  - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - \\"Maybellene\\" is one of the first rock-and-roll songs. It was written and recorded in 1955 by Chuck Berry, and inspired/adapted from the Western Swing fiddle tune \\"Ida Red,\\" which was recorded in 1938 by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. Berry's song tells the story of a hot rod race and a broken romance. It was released in July 1955 as a single by Chess Records, of Chicago, Illinois. It was Berry's first single and his first hit. \\"Maybellene\\" is considered one of the pioneering rock-and-roll songs: \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine wrote, \\"Rock & roll guitar starts here.\\" The record is an early instance of the complete rock-and-roll package: youthful subject matter; a small, guitar-driven combo; clear diction; and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement. The lyrics describe a man driving a V8 Ford chasing his unfaithful girlfriend in her Cadillac Coupe DeVille.  - Charles Edward Anderson \\"Chuck\\" Berry (born October 18, 1926) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as \\"Maybellene\\" (1955), \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" (1956), \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" (1957) and \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music.  - The Beastie Boys were an American hip hop group from New York City, formed in 1980. For the majority of their career, the group consisted of Michael \\"Mike D\\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar).  - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements.   - A novelty song is a comical or nonsensical song, performed principally for its comical effect. Humorous songs, or those containing humorous elements, are not necessarily novelty songs. The term arose in Tin Pan Alley to describe one of the major divisions of popular music. The other two divisions were ballads and dance music. Novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. They had a resurgence of interest in the 1950s and 1960s.  - \\"My Ding-a-Ling\\", from the live side of the album, was edited to approximately 4 minutes for release as a single. It was Berry's first and only single to reach number 1 in both the US and the UK.  - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.  - Swing music, or simply swing, is a form of American music that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. Swing uses a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophone and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a \\"lilting\\" swing time rhythm. The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the offbeat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb \\"to swing\\" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Woody Herman, and Artie Shaw.  - Tin Pan Alley is the name given to the collection of New York City music publishers and songwriters who dominated the popular music of the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The name originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, and a plaque exists (see below) on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it.

Given the question: Question: how does weather happen I found the following answer on Google: Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry has inadvertently modified weather patterns. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","output":"No.  The answer provided does not directly address the question \\"how does weather happen?\\" The concept of weather formation is a totally natural process driven by the laws of physics. Everyone knows that weather conditions vary from day to day, but we might not know why this happens. Weather is primarily caused by processes and changes in the Earth's atmosphere, especially interactions with sunlight. The sun warms up the atmosphere and the surface of the Earth, creating wind, pressure changes, and temperature variations. These changes in turn cause processes such as evaporation (where water is transformed into vapor) and condensation (where vapor becomes liquid).  Additionally, the rotation of the Earth influences wind and pressure patterns, and the planet's tilt relative to its orbital plane determines its seasonal weather patterns (i.e., winter, spring, summer and autumn). Extreme weather phenomena (storms, hurricanes, etc) are usually caused by more complex, large scale interactions of the factors mentioned above.

Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  Michael  for the following movie plot:  Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a widower and college history professor at George Washington University with a son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark). While driving he encounters a boy, Brady (Mason Gamble), staggering in the road with horrific injuries to his hands. Michael takes him to hospital, and meets his parents Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack), discovering they are his neighbors. The families soon become friends, and their sons join the Discoverers, a Scouts-style group. Actions of the Langs arouse latent suspicion in Michael. Michael sees blueprints in the Lang's house which are not for the building project Oliver, an architect, claims, and a wrongly delivered letter suggests he lied about where he attended college. Over dinner, Michael describes impersonal treatment from the government after his wife, an FBI agent, was killed in the line of duty. Oliver states his belief that the government should be punished for its mistakes. Michael's girlfriend, Brooke (Hope Davis), and his wife's former FBI partner, Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), dismiss Michael's concerns as paranoia. On a field trip to the site of the standoff in which his wife was killed, Michael describes to his college class what he sees as a needless tragedy: that although certain activities of the besieged family raised \\"flags,\\" other facts, not investigated before the FBI visit, both exonerated them and explained their wariness of the FBI agents, which provoked the standoff. Michael's students appear uneasy at the intensity with which Michael condemns the FBI's actions.

Here are possible answers to this question: - afternoon - dusk - daytime - night - dawn  I believe the correct choice is \\"dawn\\", here's why: A:","output":"\\"Dawn\\" is indeed the most likely correct choice for this specific scenario, and here's a thorough explanation behind this reasoning: First, let us examine each of the answer options and consider their plausibility based on the context provided. 1. Afternoon: This choice is improbable, as the party animals are described to have started drinking in the evening. It wouldn't make chronological sense for them to finish in the afternoon, as it comes before the evening. 2. Dusk: Dusk usually refers to a short period of time around sunset. Since the party animals began drinking in the evening, this would imply that their party would last for a very short duration, only covering the period around sunset. This seems uncharacteristic for a group described as \\"party animals,\\" who typically party for longer durations. 3. Daytime: This option includes both morning and afternoon. As established earlier, finishing in the afternoon would not make chronological sense. If we consider the morning as the end of the party, it still doesn't capture the full spirit of a \\"party animal\\" who parties until they can't anymore. While possible, it is not the most likely option. 4. Night: This answer is too vague as it doesn't specifically indicate when during the night the party would end. Nighttime could include the early hours of the night, late-night, or even dawn. However, since they started drinking in the evening, ending their party early in the night would be unlikely for party animals. 5. Dawn: This option suggests that the party animals partied through the entire night and only stopped once the sun started to rise. This is consistent with the behavior and enthusiasm of a group described as \\"party animals.\\" They are known for their high energy levels and commitment to partying for long durations, often until the next daybreak. Based on these points, it's reasonable to conclude that \\"dawn\\" is the most fitting answer. It aligns with the typical behavior and nature of party animals, who revel in prolonged parties and often cease their celebrations at the break of dawn. This choice not only accurately emphasizes their dedication to merrymaking but also adheres to the chronological order, thus making \\"dawn\\" the correct answer in this scenario."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bill Nelson, D-Fla., speaks with reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Friday, Nov. 16, 2012 following the committee's closed-door hearing where former CIA... (Associated Press)      In ways befitting a spy, the former four-star general was sneaked into a secure room beneath the Capitol to escape a clamorous crowd of photographers and television cameras. After more than four hours, Petraeus left much the way he came and was seen departing in a two-vehicle motorcade. About 20 minutes later, The Associated Press photographed Petreaus entering his home _ one of the only public images of him since he resigned.      The scandal over Petraeus' affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, has preoccupied Washington, even as the possibility of war loomed in Israel and the U.S. government faced a market-rattling \\"fiscal cliff\\" that could imperil the economy. So far, the scandal has ensnared Petraeus; the top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen; two Florida socialites; and a decorated FBI counterterrorism agent.      Across town, the White House acknowledged Friday that Jill Kelley, the Tampa socialite who inadvertently triggered the FBI investigation that uncovered Petraeus' affair, visited the Executive Mansion three times in the last three months with her sister, Natalie, twice eating in its mess. Kelley and her sister _ both are friends with Petraeus and Allen _ were guests of a mid-level White House aide, according to an Obama administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because those visitor records have not yet been made public. Kelley and her family also received a tour of the mansion.      The White House also acknowledged that Broadwell visited there twice since 2009.      In his Capitol Hill appearances, Petraeus, who until last week was among America's most respected military leaders, discussed with the House and Senate intelligence committees the September attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which left four Americans dead. He did not discuss his adultery with Broadwell, except to say that he regretted his behavior and that his departure was unrelated to the deadly violence in Libya. The scandal has led to a new CIA internal investigation.      \\"He was very clear his resignation was tied solely to his personal behavior,\\" said Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., a member of the Intelligence Committee. \\"He was apologetic and regretful but still Gen. Petraeus.\\"      Unlike previous appearances at the Capitol, when Petraeus walked through the front door and greeted reporters, he was smuggled inside through a network of underground hallways. Police closed down entire corridors in the Capitol. Members of Congress said they made arrangements to spare Petraeus embarrassment and humiliation. Before the scandal, he famously cultivated personal relationships with journalists and served as the U.S. war commander in Iraq and Afghanistan.      Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, apologized to reporters and photographers for the stringent security.      \\"I know that's wrankling you,\\" Feinstein said. \\"We didn't want to make it any more difficult for him. And you know, you people aren't always the easiest. So the blame is on us. Any waiting that you did, I apologize, but, you know, there's a lot of suffering going on.\\"      Feinstein said no senators asked Petraeus about the affair. A congressional staffer who attended one of the closed briefings said talk about the sex scandal was off the table.      Petraeus, 60, publicly acknowledged last week that he had cheated on his wife of 38 years with Broadwell, 40.      It wasn't until Oct. 26 that Petraeus acknowledged the affair to FBI agents, during their second interview of him, a federal law enforcement official disclosed Friday. The official was not authorized to speak on the record about the ongoing case and requested anonymity for that reason.      The Joint Chiefs of Staff are expected to meet next week to discuss the recent stumbles of two of the military's top generals, said Adm. Jonathan Greenert, chief of U.S. Naval Operations. The joint chiefs want to review ethics, accountability and behavioral issues and determine whether senior officials are living up to the military's standards, Greenert said Friday at the National Press Club.      The FBI began investigating the case against Broadwell last summer but didn't notify the White House or Congress until after the election.      In the investigation, the FBI uncovered flirtatious emails between Allen and Kelley, both of them married. On Friday, two U.S. officials said investigators have found just a handful of the emails between Allen and Kelley to be potentially problematic. They said investigators determined the vast majority of the 20,000-plus pages of documents were routine. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation.      President Barack Obama has put a promotion nomination for Allen on hold.      Kelley's emails triggered the eventual downfall of Petraeus and placed others under scrutiny. Kelley knew Petraeus and Allen from the Tampa social scene when they were stationed at nearby MacDill Air Force Base. It was there that the mid-level White House aide who hosted her at the Executive Mansion met her, said the White House official.      Broadwell attended two meetings in the White House's executive office building. In 2009 she met with a member of Obama's national security staff and in June 2011 she joined about 20 people for a briefing on Afghanistan and Pakistan policy, the official said. The 2011 meeting was just a few hours before Obama gave a prime-time speech about withdrawing troops from Iraq.      Petraeus, in his first media interview since he resigned, told CNN this week that he had never given classified information to Broadwell. She has said she didn't receive such material from Petraeus.      But the FBI found a substantial number of classified documents on Broadwell's computer and in her home, according to the law enforcement official, and is investigating how she got them. The Army has now suspended her security clearance.      The official outlined new details Friday of the timing of the FBI investigation that showed that agents spent the summer making certain that no one had hacked into Petraeus' computers to track his movements _ a potential national security vulnerability raised by some of the first emails they saw in the case. They also used the summer to rule out any possibility he somehow participated in harassing Kelley by email.      After that, in early fall, Broadwell was interviewed by the FBI and agents searched her computers and found substantial amounts of classified documents, the law enforcement official said. The focus of the investigation shifted and agents spent most of October working with the Pentagon to determine where she got the documents, their significance and her right to have them.      The CIA on Thursday opened an exploratory investigation into Petraeus' conduct. The inquiry \\"doesn't presuppose any particular outcome,\\" said CIA spokesman Preston Golson. At the same time, Army officials say that, at this point, there is no appetite for recalling Petraeus to active duty to pursue any adultery charges against him.      ___      Associated Press writers Nedra Pickler, Larry Margasak, Adam Goldman, Jim Kuhnhenn, Lolita C.

Petraeus , the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, told lawmakers on Friday that classified intelligence reports revealed that the deadly assault on the American diplomatic mission in Libya was a terrorist attack, but that the administration refrained from saying it suspected that the perpetrators of the attack were Al Qaeda affiliates and sympathizers to avoid tipping off the groups.      Mr. Petraeus, who resigned last week after admitting to an extramarital affair, said the names of groups suspected in the attack — including Al Qaeda’s franchise in North Africa and a local Libyan group, Ansar al-Shariah — were removed from the public explanation of the attack immediately after the assault to avoiding alerting the militants that American intelligence and law enforcement agencies were tracking them, lawmakers said.      In his first public appearance since he resigned last week, Mr. Petraeus testified before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees in back-to-back closed-door hearings as lawmakers from both parties continued to wrestle with questions about the Obama administration’s handling of the Sept. 11 attacks in Benghazi that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans and why its public portrayal conflicted with the intelligence agencies’ classified assessments.      “They knew right away that there were terrorists involved in the operation,” said Representative C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.      During his testimony, Mr. Petraeus expressed regret for his affair. Lawmakers did not ask him about it. In addition to what the administration knew about assailants, they focused their questions on possible security lapses at the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, particularly given a spate of attacks this year in Benghazi against the American Mission, the British ambassador’s convoy and the Red Cross.      State Department officials have said five diplomatic security officers were at the mission on Sept. 11, including two traveling with Mr. Stevens. They were initially up against more than 50 fighters, armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, who easily breached the compound and set fire to it.      Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said Mr. Petraeus’s testimony showed that “clearly the security measures were inadequate despite an overwhelming and growing amount of information that showed the area in Benghazi was dangerous, particularly on the night of Sept. 11.”      But many of the questions from lawmakers dealt with how the intelligence services and the administration over all responded to a request from the House committee for unclassified talking points about what happened, in advance of a closed briefing by Mr. Petraeus on Sept. 14, three days after the attack.      The issue took on added resonance after Republicans criticized the ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, for suggesting on Sunday talk shows five days after the assault that the siege in Benghazi was a spontaneous protest rather than an opportunistic terrorist attack.      Democrats leapt to Ms. Rice’s defense on Friday, saying she was simply following the unclassified talking points provided to her. “I really think Ambassador Rice is being treated unfairly,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who leads the Intelligence Committee.      The talking points initially drafted by the C.I.A. attributed the attack to fighters with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the organization’s North Africa franchise, and Ansar al-Shariah, a Libyan group, some of whose members have Al Qaeda ties.      Mr. Petraeus and other top C.I.A. officials signed off on the draft and then circulated it to other intelligence agencies, as well as the State Department and National Security Council.      At some point in the process — Mr. Petraeus told lawmakers he was not sure where — objections were raised to naming the groups, and the less specific word “extremists” was substituted. ||||| Former CIA Director David Petraeus testified Friday that the CIA believes the Benghazi attacks were conducted by terrorists, not a spontaneous demonstration, according to lawmakers who provided accounts of the closed hearing before Congress.      Appearing on Capitol Hill for the first time since the scandal that ended his career at the intelligence agency, Petraeus tried to explain the discrepancy in Obama administration officials’ initial public statements about the cause of the attacks.

Peter King (R-N.Y.) “It was not spontaneous, and [there was] clear terrorist involvement.”      Petraeus discussed early on his affair with Paula Broadwell, according to lawmakers. He said the controversy over what happened in Benghazi is a matter completely separate from the dalliance that caused him to resign. He also said he regretted the circumstances of his resignation, according to lawmakers.      “We made clear at the start that that would not be the focus of his questioning,” said King. “I would say 10 seconds into it, that was off to the side.”      (Also on POLITICO: No perfect choice to replace Petraeus)      King also said the original talking points put out by the CIA to explain the attack differed from the final version of the story.      “The original talking points were much more specific about Al Qaeda involvement,” King said, later adding that Petraeus didn’t know why the references to Al Qaeda were removed from the final version.      Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.) said the confusion over terrorist attacks vs. demonstrations at Benghazi might be chalked up to the difference between classified and unclassified talking points.      “There may have been confusion with the unclassified talking points. … Perhaps there’s greater clarity in the classified talking points,” Langevin told reporters. “There were perhaps some subtleties that were used that may have been understood by some to mean one thing, where others may have had a different understanding of words — for example, ‘extremist’ versus ‘terrorist.’”      Petraeus told lawmakers the CIA believed it to be a terrorist attack from the beginning, King said.      “I told him in my questions that I had a very different recollection of that,” said King , the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee and a member of the Intelligence Committee. “The clear impression was given was that the overwhelming amount of evidence was that it rose out of a spontaneous demonstration and it was not a terrorist attack.”      That account differed from that of Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.), who said Petraeus “reinforced” the belief among CIA officials in the 24 hours after the attack that it was the result of the demonstration.      “He clarified that after more information came in, that it was not a protest,” Ruppersberger told reporters.      Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), another Intellligence Committee member who heard from Petraeus, backed up Ruppersberger’s view of Petraeus’s testimony.      ”It was clear that initially that he thought that this was spontaneous, that extremist groups or indivduals may have capitalized on this situation to attack the temporary facility,” Schiff said in a phone interview with POLITICO. ||||| WASHINGTON—Former Central Intelligence Agency Director David Petraeus said Friday that he told Congress from the earliest days that there was \\"significant terrorist involvement\\" in the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya—adding to the controversy over the administration's handling of the attack.      Mr. Petraeus, who resigned last week after acknowledging an extramarital affair, went to Congress on Friday to defend his old agency's role in the response to the Benghazi, Libya, attack. In his closed-door testimony, he said that, in secret briefings with lawmakers soon after the attack, he had apprised them of the likely involvement of a local militant group, Ansar al-Sharia, said Rep. Peter King (R., N.Y.), describing his comments.      Enlarge Image Close Bloomberg News Rep. Peter King disputed how strongly ex-CIA chief Petraeus tied the Benghazi cousulate attack to terrorism.      Those comments rekindled debate about the intelligence community's initial assessments that the attack was a terrorist strike, and whether the Obama administration resisted calling it a terrorist act for political reasons.      The controversy also was extended when some lawmakers said they had a different recollection of Mr. Petraeus's earlier comments. Rep. King, who described Mr. Petraeus's Friday testimony, said his recollection of his earlier conversations was different.      \\"He said today that, at the time, he was emphasizing the role of Ansar al-Sharia. But at the time, my recollection is that he was minimizing the role of Ansar al-Sharia,'' Mr. King told reporters, referring to a local militant group sympathetic to al Qaeda.      Key Facts in the Petraeus Scandal See a guide to the players and a timeline of the scandal that led Gen. David Petraeus to resign. View Graphics      Mr. Petraeus spoke behind closed doors Friday in long-awaited meetings with House and Senate intelligence committee members. The Libya attack claimed the lives of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.      Mr. Petraeus's Friday testimony, as outlined by lawmakers who were present, was generally consistent with how U.S. officials have described the shifting intelligence assessments of the consulate assault in interviews dating back to the days after it occurred. Still, his appearance and testimony this week by top U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement officials haven't blunted questions about the use of intelligence or about the administration's explanations.      Enlarge Image Close Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Former Central Intelligence Agency Director David Petraeus, shown in 2011 at a retirement tribute, met with lawmakers Friday to offer his assessment of the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya.      For instance, Mr. King and House Democrats clashed over whether Mr. Petraeus said Friday that there had been changes in CIA \\"talking points\\" designed to play down the role of terrorists.      Republicans charge the Obama administration resisted conclusions that the assault was the product of a terrorist attack for more than a week so it could avoid explaining, during a heated presidential campaign, how militants with ties to al Qaeda struck a U.S. facility on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. CIA talking points used by the White House said the attack grew out of a protest against an anti-Islamic video.      Top economist Alice Rivlin says the image of the U.S. will take a hammering if it's unable to avoid the fiscal cliff. WSJ reporters bring the latest on how close Congress is to a deal and assess the fallout of the scandal engulfing David Petraeus.      A CIA analysis prepared the morning after the attack said that the attack appeared intentional and didn't appear to stem from a peaceful protest, according to a senior U.S. official. Analysis that day also mentioned the possibility of connections to an al Qaeda affiliate.      However, that information about specific groups involved came from classified sources the subject of debate among intelligence officials, so it was left out of unclassified talking points.      The CIA began receiving new information Sept. 15 that cast doubt about the protest, but the assessment wasn't immediately changed. On Sept. 16, United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice in a series of television interviews cited the official assessment as outlined in talking points. The CIA maintained its assessment until Sept. 20, when intelligence officials told counterparts at the White House that it had changed, according to senior U.S. officials      The talking points used by Ms. Rice were developed by the CIA from the classified reports, in response to a request from Congress, U.S. officials have said.      While the early classified reports mentioned the possible involvement of Ansar al-Sharia, the talking points developed for public use didn't.      WSJ reporters in Washington discuss the week's two big stories: the negotiations to find a deficit deal to avoid the looming fiscal cliff and the David Petraeus scandal that has engulfed the American intelligence community.      Mr. King said Congress needed to do more probing to try to determine who specifically decided to alter the references to terrorists in the earlier draft.      However, a senior U.S. official familiar with the drafting of the talking points said the name of specific groups and their ties with al Qaeda were omitted in part because that information came from classified sources that needed to be protected.      The intelligence linking the militant groups also were \\"tenuous,\\" the official said.      \\"The points were reviewed by CIA leadership and coordinated in the interagency at a senior level,\\" the official said, referring to the process by which the government's various intelligence agencies coordinate their findings. \\"The points were not, as has been insinuated by some, edited to minimize the role of extremists, diminish terrorist affiliations or play down that this was an attack.\\"      The official said the talking points contained the word \\"extremists,\\" which was intended to convey the presence of militants or possible terrorists, and Ms. Rice used the term extremists in television appearances. Republicans have criticized the administration's refusal to refer to the specific involvement of terrorists, rather than extremists.      \\"The controversy this word choice caused came as a surprise,\\" the official said.      Mr. Petraeus's appearance Friday took on its own cloak-and-dagger feel, as the former CIA director navigated his way to the hearings through underground tunnels to avoid being mobbed by reporters. He hasn't made a public appearance since resigning after acknowledging an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell.      Democrats said the discussions with Mr. Petraeus made clear there had been no political interference with intelligence reports or talking points.      \\"He thoroughly debunked the idea that there was some White House tinting or shading to this,\\" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), a member of the House intelligence panel.      Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said questions remained to be answered about the talking points used by Ms. Rice. He said he realized the Sept. 11 assault was an act of terrorism from the start.      \\"There was no question in the mind of anybody that this was an act of terrorism from the get-go,\\" Sen. Chambliss said.      Many lawmakers praised Mr. Petraeus, a retired Army general who resigned in the wake of a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe that uncovered his extramarital affair. Lawmakers said Mr. Petraeus told them the probe hadn't influenced his statements or the inquiry into the consulate attack.

Point the rod towards where you want your bait to go. 2. Take a look at the button on the back of your reel. Press it down with your thumb and hold it. This will unlock the line, so you can cast it. 3. Now, bring the rod back in a smooth, quick motion like you're swinging a baseball bat. Don't let go of the button yet! 4. When the rod comes forward, like you're pointing at the water again, you can release the button on the reel. Your bait should fly out into the water! 5. To get even better at casting, practice your timing when you release the button. Remember, practice makes perfect! And there you go! That's the next step in casting your fishing line. Keep trying and have fun, and maybe you'll catch a big fish!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Choose your answer from: (I). she will be miserable. (II). she will leave abruptly. (III). have a conversation.","output":"In order to determine the most likely outcome for Casey, I will analyze each option and evaluate their plausibility based on the information provided. I. She will be miserable: The information given doesn't necessarily imply that Casey would be miserable. Meeting a friend at a bar to discuss a business idea suggests a casual, potentially enjoyable setting for a conversation. Therefore, this option seems less likely. II. She will leave abruptly: Again, there is no information in the provided scenario that suggests Casey would have a reason to leave abruptly. If Casey had a prior appointment, we would need more context to properly gauge the likelihood of this option. It doesn't seem like the most probable outcome based on the information provided. III. Have a conversation: This option aligns well with the given scenario. Casey met her friend at a bar to discuss a business idea, which implies that they will talk and exchange ideas regarding the potential venture.

Problem:There are three major apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms. Although APOE-epsilon3 is considered a longevity gene, APOE-epsilon4 is a dual risk factor to atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease. We have expressed full-length and N- and C-terminal truncated apoE3 and apoE4 tailored to eliminate helix and domain interactions to unveil structural and functional disturbances. The N-terminal truncated apoE4-(72-299) and C-terminal truncated apoE4-(1-231) showed more complicated or aggregated species than those of the corresponding apoE3 counterparts. This isoformic structural variation did not exist in the presence of dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine. The C-terminal truncated apoE-(1-191) and apoE-(1-231) proteins greatly lost lipid binding ability as illustrated by the dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine turbidity clearance. The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor binding ability, determined by a competition binding assay of 3H-LDL to the LDL receptor of HepG2 cells, showed that apoE4 proteins with N-terminal (apoE4-(72-299)), C-terminal (apoE4-(1-231)), or complete C-terminal truncation (apoE4-(1-191)) maintained greater receptor binding abilities than their apoE3 counterparts.

Article: There’s nothing wrong with going to a party or hanging out with friends, as long as you don’t feel forced into it. Don’t succumb to peer pressure because you want to fit in or be cool.  Before you start trying to balance your social life with your academics, make sure the things that comprise your social life are activities you actually want to take part in. Focus on things that bring you enjoyment and a welcome distraction from your schoolwork. Try some new activities. For example, you could try signing up for a Zumba class, or take a watercolor painting class. You can try new activities with friends or on your own. Make sure the people you allow in your life are supportive of your academic goals. If they make you feel guilty for not hanging out with them, they’re not being supportive of what you’re trying to achieve.  Talk to them about your goals, focusing on finding a middle ground between the involvement they expect of you and your academic schedule. If they seem more focused on getting what they want and not helping you achieve your goals, you might have to start asking yourself if they’re a real friend. Try out some new activities to meet people who share your interests and who may also make supportive friends. You might find that some of the clubs and organizations in your school have the kinds of activities you want to participate in. Joining a school club gives you the ability to spend time with like-minded students, building relationships that can help you during your academic career as well as giving you a needed social break. Additionally, since club activities often follow a fixed schedule, it’ll be easier to fit them in around the schedule you’ve set for your schoolwork.  If you want to stay in good health, you might want to join a sports team or a fitness-focused club. Clubs centered around artistic pursuits, such as sculpture or painting, can help you diversify your skillset while expressing yourself. Clubs focusing on math and the sciences can help you improve your skills in a way that’s directly useful for your schoolwork. Keep in mind that you can always start a club of your own if you can’t find a club that you want to join. While a teacher can help you with your schoolwork, a guidance counselor or academic advisor can help you with the overall balancing of your schoolwork and social life. They can serve as a good reference point for any questions you may have. Don’t hesitate to turn to them for help with all aspects of your academic and social life:  Guidance counselors are usually trained to help you set academic goals, study more efficiently as well as helping you resolve conflicts with family and friends. Some guidance counselors also provide therapy and counseling services that can prove helpful as you straighten out your social life.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which friend received more antiretroviral drugs?  Hint: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. The answer to this question is:","output":"Nigel received more antiretroviral drugs. This is because he was infected with the HIV virus, and antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy or ART) are specifically used to treat and manage HIV and AIDS.

The speakers of Iranian languages are known as Iranian peoples. Historical Iranian languages are grouped in three stages: Old Iranian (until 400 BCE), Middle Iranian (400 BCE – 900 CE), and New Iranian (since 900 CE). Of the Old Iranian languages, the better understood and recorded ones are Old Persian (a language of Achaemenid Iran) and Avestan (the language of the Avesta). Middle Iranian languages included Middle Persian (a language of Sassanid Iran), Parthian, and Bactrian.  As of 2008, there were an estimated 150–200 million native speakers of Iranian languages.

What is the sentiment of the following review? What a disappointing experience. Not feeling well and knowing my Primary Care Doctor's office had closed I decided to run to Urgent Care.  Unfortunately this was an upsetting experience. Upon arriving I was quoted 25 minutes. After 40 minutes I approached the bench and was told it was 25 minutes until I would be checked in...not what I was told. I wsa finally asked to Check In and asked how long it would be to get to see the doctor.  She said that would be another 25 minutes and to finally see the doctor could be another 45 minutes..Seriously? I decided to stick with them and finally made it back to see the doctor. The nurse was nice and when the doctor finally arrived she was nice as well and addressed my concerns very thoroughly.  Unfortunately my last ten minutes were the best, but overall what I nightmare. (A). negative (B). positive","output":"(A). negative The sentiment of this review is negative because the reviewer describes it as a disappointing and upsetting experience with long waiting times.

(B) Positive is incorrect because the majority of the review talks about the negative aspects of the visit and only a small portion is positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - A forest fire starts - The fire surrounds the vicinity - The animals are trapped - Those that survive have their habitat destroyed - The survivors must find a new habitat - Conflict with other animals occur.  Question: suppose the fire burns out quickly because it lacks fuel happens, how will it affect a greater negative effect on the animals.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"Suppose the fire burns out quickly because it lacks fuel, the negative effect on the animals will likely be less severe compared to a longer-lasting, more destructive fire. The quick burnout implies that the fire will consume less vegetation and thus, potentially leave some areas of the habitat less affected. In turn, this might provide the animals some refuge within their original habitat. Regarding the second effect mentioned - \\"The survivors must find a new habitat\\" - the perturbation of the fire burning out quickly will likely lead to a less severe impact. When the fire consumes lesser vegetation and spreads less widely due to lack of fuel, it provides the possibility that the habitat may not be entirely destroyed. Consequently, if more parts of the habitat remain undamaged, the survivors may not need to search as intensively for a completely new habitat. This lessened effect on animals needing to find a new habitat can also mitigate the risk of conflict with other animals. As they may establish themselves in undamaged areas of their original habitat, the need to contend with other species in foreign territories will be minimized. Thus, the overall negative impact of the fire on the animals would be reduced. In conclusion, the quick burnout of the fire due to lack of fuel will likely have a less severe effect on the animals, making it less necessary for them to find a new habitat, and reducing potential conflicts with other animals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Available choices:  (1). yes  (2). it is not possible to tell  (3). no","output":"(1). Yes. The premise provided states that \\"A balding professor giving a lecture to students on the topic of 'opportunity'.\\" Considering the hypothesis given, \\"A professor with no hair giving a lecture to students,\\" we can analyze the similarities and differences between the two statements to determine their correlation. First, let's break down the premise and the hypothesis into their core elements: Premise: - Balding professor - Giving a lecture - Lecture topic: \\"opportunity\\" - Students are the audience Hypothesis: - Professor with no hair - Giving a lecture - Students are the audience We can observe certain similarities between the premise and the hypothesis: 1. In both statements, a professor is giving a lecture. This highlights a common action taking place in both scenarios. 2. Both statements involve an audience composed of students. This connection demonstrates that the context is the same in both the premise and hypothesis - a learning environment. Now, let's take a closer look at the key difference between the premise and the hypothesis: 1. The premise describes a \\"balding\\" professor, while the hypothesis refers to a \\"professor with no hair.\\" Both descriptions imply some extent of hair loss; however, the premise's description of the professor as \\"balding\\" indicates that the process of losing hair is ongoing. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that the professor has already lost all their hair. Given the similarities and the key difference outlined above, one could argue that the premise supports the hypothesis to some extent, as both statements involve a professor who is experiencing hair loss. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the premise's description of the professor as \\"balding\\" indicates an ongoing process, whereas the hypothesis refers to a \\"professor with no hair.\\" Despite this distinction, the premise still tells us that the hypothesis is most likely true due to the overlap in context, action, and audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying.

BRUSSELS — All but two European Union countries agreed Monday to new and tougher measures to enforce budget discipline in the euro zone, but the bloc still showed few signs of producing a comprehensive solution for the sovereign debt crisis or a credible plan to revive fragile economies across Europe’s weakened Mediterranean tier.      The meeting of 27 European Union heads of state and government here in Brussels was aimed at completing the text of a so-called fiscal compact for the 17 nations relying on or intending to join the euro zone — with only Britain and the Czech Republic opting not to adopt the measures.      After a meeting lasting seven hours, the leaders also issued a declaration calling for a new push to restart growth and combat joblessness across the Continent.      But a number of politicians and analysts said the pledge by the European leaders to create new jobs was mostly empty, and others complained that the proposed rules to keep deficits under control contained little to actually help nations with high borrowing costs.      The summit declaration also skirted the continuing problems in Greece, where a second bailout is being held up by the inability of the government in Athens to complete a deal with private holders of Greek bonds over the losses they should accept.      Until Athens and its private-sector creditors can agree on a 132 billion writedown on Greek government debt, the International Monetary Fund and the European Union are not prepared to sign off on a further bailout. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said the Greek situation would not be addressed until after representatives of Greece’s so-called troika of creditors — the European Union, the I.M.F. and the European Central Bank — report back on their investigation into what will be needed for Greece to manage its finances on its own.      Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, told a news conference at the end of the summit that there would be a “definitive agreement” on the private sector’s involvement in reducing Greek debt in coming days. After Monday night’s summit meeting, informal talks continued between the Greek prime minister, Lucas Papademos, and European officials.      Despite the various other problems to deal with, an agreement on the fiscal compact could clear the way for Germany to accept stronger efforts by the European Central Bank to support ailing countries and a more comprehensive bailout fund aimed at protecting Italy and Spain against the risk of default.      “It is an important step forward to a stability union,” Mrs. Merkel told reporters. “For those looking at the union and the euro from the outside, it is a very important to show this commitment.” Britain, which clashed openly with France and Germany last month over the pact, did not give any ground Monday and was joined by the Czech Republic, which also elected to stay outside.      “We are not signing this treaty,” David Cameron, the British prime minister, said. “We are not ratifying it. And it places no obligations” on the United Kingdom, he said.      He added: “Our national interest is that these countries get on and sort out the mess that is the euro.”      Mr. Sarkozy sounded philosophical about the Britons’ intransigence. “There are different degrees of integration and everyone is free to choose where they stand,” he said.      While European leaders agreed to bring a permanent bailout fund into existence earlier than previously foreseen, they postponed any final decisions on its ultimate size and how it will be financed. The International Monetary Fund has been pressing Europe to commit enough money to provide a credible backstop that would insure that Italy and Spain could pay their bills and continue to finance their debts.      Germany backed away from a suggestion that it wanted the government in Athens to cede temporarily control over tax and spending decisions to a new, all-powerful, budget commissioner before it can secure further bailouts. Italy won its battle to restrict the scope of the fiscal compact, which calls for making it easier to impose sanctions against countries that break European Union budget rules. The text said the compact would make it harder to block sanctions against countries that exceed annual deficit targets but that the same tough system would not apply to nations with excessive overall debt, like Italy.      The compact will come into force in those nations that agree to its terms once 12 euro zone nations have ratified it. That would prevent the project being held up if one or two nations hold referendums on the deal.      Still, impatience with the German focus on belt-tightening loomed large over the summit meeting.      “You don’t have to be an economics professor to know that if you have zero growth you are not going to sort things out,” said Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament. Critics of austerity point to Greece, which is being strangled by a vicious cycle of deficit cutting, declining tax revenues and more budget cutting, while making little if any progress on its overall budget deficit.      Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the centrist liberal and democrat group, and a former prime minister of Belgium, took a similar stand.      “The new agreement consolidates fiscal discipline but omits completely to address the other side of the coin — that of solidarity and investment that will create jobs and growth,” Mr. Verhofstadt said. “E.U. leaders should act instead of producing more paper.” ||||| Media caption Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel says EU leaders have taken an \\"important step forward\\"      Twenty-five of the EU's 27 member states have agreed to join a fiscal treaty to enforce budget discipline.      The Czech Republic and the UK refused to sign up. UK Prime Minister David Cameron said his government would act if the treaty threatened UK interests.      He still has \\"legal concerns\\" about the use of EU institutions in enforcing the fiscal treaty, he said.      The Czechs cited \\"constitutional reasons\\" for their refusal, France's President Nicolas Sarkozy said.      Czech President Vaclav Klaus, a Eurosceptic, may be reluctant to sign the treaty, analysts say.      The goal is much closer co-ordination of budget policy across the EU to prevent excessive debts accumulating.      Germany - the eurozone's biggest lender and most powerful economy - was particularly keen to get a binding treaty adopted to enforce budget rules.      The treaty will empower the European Court of Justice to monitor compliance and impose fines on rule-breakers.      The treaty also spells out the enhanced role of the European Commission in scrutinising national budgets.      Media caption British PM David Cameron: \\"We will not be ratifying this treaty and it places no obligation on the UK\\"      The Czech Republic is not yet in the euro, but like the other new EU member states it is committed to joining.      European Union leaders also discussed ways to stimulate economic growth despite the stringent austerity budgets in many countries - and focused on how to reduce unemployment across the eurozone.      UK concerns      The UK and Denmark are the only states with explicit opt-outs from the euro.      Mr Cameron said \\"it's good that the new treaty is absolutely explicit and clear that it cannot encroach on the competences of the EU\\".      Analysis No-one believes that this treaty on its own will solve anything, and it could face an uncertain future. The Socialist candidate in the French presidential election Francois Hollande has promised to renegotiate it if he wins, and President Nicolas Sarkozy has now confirmed that the treaty will not be ratified in France before the election takes place. In fact given general agreement on the need for measures to promote growth, some critics have described the fiscal treaty as little more than a distraction. But Germany has pushed hard for its implementation - partly to persuade political opinion in Berlin that there really will be strict rules in place to ensure that another debt crisis can't happen in the future. Only then will Germany consider spending more money to help other countries which are struggling with their debts now. The fear is that if Germany doesn't act, the current crisis will only get worse. Q&A: Debt crisis deal What caused the crisis?      \\"They must not take measures that in any way undermine the EU single market,\\" he said, adding: \\"we'll be watching like a hawk\\".      He insisted that the treaty would impose \\"no obligations on the UK\\".      Mr Cameron used his veto last month to opt out of the treaty, arguing that the UK needed to keep its authority over financial services in the City of London.      The eurozone crisis dominated Monday's summit, with debt-laden Greece still at risk of defaulting.      A general strike in Belgium, paralysing transport, reminded EU leaders of public discontent with austerity as they arrived for the summit.      The talks also concentrated on reducing unemployment, which is averaging 10% across the eurozone, though youth unemployment is often much higher.      There are fears that wide-ranging budget cuts will harm enterprise and training.      The leaders discussed measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), many of which complain of excessive administrative costs imposed by Brussels.      In a joint statement on economic growth they noted that cutting budget deficits was \\"not in itself sufficient\\".      \\"We have to modernise our economies and strengthen our competitiveness to secure sustainable growth,\\" the statement said.      The EU will help to fund schemes to get young people into work or training in member states with the highest youth unemployment levels.      They pledged to speed up measures to develop the EU single market, including:      agreement on a common EU patent system by July;      better targeting of EU funds towards SMEs;      national legislation to create a functioning single market in services and energy.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Q: In this task, you are given a question. You have to answer the question based on your information. How did Faith in the Earth and Thus Spoke Zarathustra progress Friedrich Nietzsche's own form of unique belief system? A:","output":"Part #1: Understanding the question. Usage: How did Faith in the Earth and Thus Spoke Zarathustra progress Friedrich Nietzsche's own form of unique belief system? The question asks us to analyze the impact of two works by Friedrich Nietzsche, \\"Faith in the Earth\\" and \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra,\\" on the development of his own unique belief system. Part #2: Identifying the works. Usage: \\"Faith in the Earth\\" and \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" are two philosophical works by Friedrich Nietzsche. These works are important as they provide insights into his thoughts and beliefs. Part #3: Exploring Nietzsche's unique belief system. Usage: Nietzsche's belief system is known for its concepts of the Ubermensch (Superman), the will to power, and the eternal recurrence, among others. It is rooted in his criticism of traditional morality and religion, as well as his advocacy for individualism and self-overcoming. Part #4: Analyzing the impact of \\"Faith in the Earth\\" on Nietzsche's belief system. Usage: In \\"Faith in the Earth,\\" Nietzsche critiques traditional religious and metaphysical views, rejecting the idea of a transcendent God. This work contributes to his belief system by promoting a worldview that values the Earth and human experiences over a belief in a higher power. For instance, the text emphasizes the importance of embracing life and earthly experiences rather than seeking spiritual transcendence. Part #5: Analyzing the impact of \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" on Nietzsche's belief system. Usage: \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" is one of Nietzsche's most famous works and introduces the concept of the Ubermensch. It is an influential text in his belief system because it presents an ideal for humans to strive towards. It also showcases his ideas about the will to power and the eternal recurrence. For example, the titular character Zarathustra encourages individuals to overcome their limitations and create their own values, exemplifying Nietzsche’s emphasis on individualism and self-overcoming. In conclusion, both \\"Faith in the Earth\\" and \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" played significant roles in progressing Friedrich Nietzsche's unique belief system by critiquing traditional values, promoting individualism and self-overcoming, and introducing key concepts like the Ubermensch, the will to power, and the eternal recurrence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors.  But I can use this background: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.  What is an answer for this question: Which student read more about a greater frequency of collisions? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's look at the information provided: 1. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. 2. Gabe studied about other influencing factors.

Loki was hurt in a fall and decided to get a bandage but left out the alcohol because the","output":"pain was unbearable. The wound, a deep gash and blood oozing all over his arm, needed immediate attention. The trickster god, known for his cunning and agility, knew the injury could end up being an obstacle to his future mischief if not treated correctly. As he searched for a bandage to wrap the nasty cut, he made another split decision based on his history of pain, endurance, and expertise in the healing arts.  Loki knew the severity of the wound warranted both bandaging and proper disinfection. However, he could not bring himself to use alcohol, as he was afraid the excruciating pain from the stinging sensation would be too much for him to bear. This choice, born from both his trepidation and pride, could potentially lead to serious consequences. As Loki dressed his wound with the bandage, he thought about the various alternatives he could use to disinfect the wound that might be less agonizing than alcohol. His mind raced through the countless potions, elixirs, and salves he had witnessed his fellow gods using before in similar situations. A particular memory struck him. Once, when his brother Thor had been injured on the battlefield, a healer had applied a concoction of honey, lavender, and crushed rose petals to the wound. Loki remembered how the beautiful fragrance of the concoction filled the air, and how Thor had reported little to no pain during the healing process, with the wound ultimately healing successfully. Another option that came across his mind was the use of medicinal mushrooms. In particular, the chaga mushroom, found on birch trees, was known for its potent anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiseptic properties. By making a poultice out of chaga and applying it to his wound, Loki knew that not only could he avoid the sting of alcohol but also harness the powerful healing properties of the mushroom. Loki weighed both options carefully, considering each one but unsure which one to choose. While the combination of honey, lavender, and rose petals seemed to be an effective and less painful method to heal Thor's wound, it heavily relied on anecdotal evidence. On the other hand, the chaga mushroom had been historically attributed to numerous successful healings and even documented scientific benefits. However, Loki felt that the efficacy of each remedy could be different from person to person, and he found himself hesitant to make a decision. Contemplating for a few more moments, Loki decided to combine both remedies, hoping the synergistic properties of the unique ingredients would create an effective treatment for his wound. So, he set out on a quest to gather the necessary ingredients: honey, lavender, rose petals, and chaga mushrooms. Once he had obtained them all, Loki lightly crushed the rose petals and mixed them with the honey and lavender. Then, he prepared the chaga poultice by grinding the mushrooms into a paste. He applied the poultice to the wound first, and then gently spread the honey-lavender-and-rose-petal mixture on top, sealing it with the bandage he had already acquired. While time would tell whether his unorthodox remedy would work, in the end, the combination of ingredients seemed to have a soothing effect, bringing one of the most elusive smiles to Loki's face. It was a smile of relief, of pride, and of anticipation as he looked forward to his swift recovery and scheming of new tricks. Hoping he had made a wise decision to not use alcohol on his wound, Loki couldn't help but imagine the adventures that awaited him once his body had fully healed, ready for a new beginning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A Health Ministry official stationed at North Korea's embassy in Beijing—tasked with sourcing medical supplies for a clinic visited by Kim Jong Un and his family—has reportedly sought asylum after disappearing with his family late last month, reports South Korea's Yonhap News, per AFP. The report doesn't mention his proposed destination. However, a source tells a separate South Korean paper that two staffers at the Beijing embassy—including one who sourced medical supplies for a Pyongyang clinic—are seeking asylum at the Japanese embassy in Beijing. The source says the two officials went into hiding around the same time before resurfacing at the Japanese embassy. The source says Chinese and Japanese officials are discussing their cases, but officials are also working to house the defectors in South Korea, per the South China Morning Post. A rep for the Japanese government, however, says \\"there's no truth in the reports that North Korean asylum seekers contacted the Japanese embassy, and we're not aware of any situation involving North Koreans hoping to defect to Japan.\\" A rep for South Korea's Unification Ministry adds \\"at this moment, I have nothing to confirm on the report.\\" (A North Korean soldier just defected.)

Most of us enjoyed reading a specific book or series of books as children. Re-read your favorite to feel like a kid again.  For a more authentic and affordable experience, check out a book from the public library instead of ordering it online or shopping in a store. Re-create the times you stayed up late reading under the covers with a flashlight. While automobiles present a convenient way to get from point A to point B, they tend to make you feel more like a grown up. Instead, try riding a bike so you can remember how it felt to coast down a hill with the wind in your face. Don’t worry about heading to a specific destination. Most kids just enjoy riding for the fun of it. Research and rock out to a top 40 playlist from your youth.  Dig out your old CDs, cassettes, 8-tracks, or vinyl to relive pleasure of music before the Internet. If you discarded all your old media, many Internet radio services already have playlists built around certain decades or years, so it shouldn’t be difficult to re-create the soundtrack of your childhood. Most children don’t have the inhibitions that adults do, so sing and dance the way you used to. As an adult, you probably agonize over what you eat, but as a kid, you likely had a favorite treat or food that was less than healthy. You don’t have to make a regular habit out of this, but enjoying some of these treats might help you feel like a kid again:  Popsicles or ice cream. Pizza. Candy. A specific type of soda or fruit punch. Cotton candy. Recapture that youthful feeling and relive your glory days by visiting some of your childhood haunts. Here are a few locations to help get you started:  Fairs, the circus, or amusement parks. Mini-golf courses. Arcades. Go-kart tracks. Water parks. Zoos. Toy stores. Skating rinks. Playgrounds. Kids play with a sense of abandon and don’t worry about making a mess. Put on clothes you don’t mind getting dirty, and splash around in puddles or make some mud pies. The pride of accomplishment that comes from climbing a tree and the sense of exhilaration that you feel when sitting up high will take you back to a simpler time.  Remember, you’re probably bigger now than you were the last time you attempted this, and make sure you reach for sturdy branches. If you don’t care for heights, don’t despair. Try playing, reading, or enjoying a picnic below the tree. Choose what you want to wear without worrying about whether it matches perfectly or conveys the right message to your peers or colleagues. If you work in an environment with a strict dress code, it might be best to save this activity for your day off. If you are fortunate enough to live in an area with an ice-cream truck, take advantage of this opportunity usually reserved for kids. Ice-cream from the truck often tastes better than the kind you get at the store, and it can be hard to find some of these childhood treats anywhere else. Many people spend their childhoods swinging, sliding, and climbing a jungle gym at the playground. Visiting these places will remind you how it feels to play like a kid.  If you’re feeling adventurous, try tackling the monkey bars. Much of this equipment is designed to hold the weight of children. Test it out carefully before using, because nothing makes you feel more like an adult than filling out emergency-room paperwork. Although you might not consider yourself an artistic person, spending a little time engaged in creative activities will help you relax.  You don’t have to pick an elaborate craft or activity. Use modeling clay, a coloring book, or even paint by numbers for a simple but fun experience. Art projects make great rainy day activity. Think about some of the games you enjoyed as a child, and recruit some friends or family members to join you. Here are a few ideas to get you started:  Hopscotch. Four square. Tag or capture the flag. Dodgeball. Hide-and-seek. Jumping rope. Board games. Team sports. When was the last time you just enjoyed being around your friends? Get your group together without a specific agenda, or enjoy some of the activities you used to love as kids.  Organize a slumber party. Play video games. Watch scary movies. Play truth-or-dare. Make a pact that you won't talk about work or adult responsibilities.

A:","output":"To determine which tip will not result in bigger skeletal muscles, we need to analyze the types of exercises involved in tips A and B. Step 1: Analyze tip A Tip A involves weight lifting, which is an anaerobic exercise. This type of exercise consists of short-duration, high-intensity activities that primarily involve resistance training. Weight lifting stimulates the growth of skeletal muscles by causing micro-tears in the muscle fibers, which the body repairs and rebuilds to be stronger and bigger. Step 2: Analyze tip B Tip B does not involve weight lifting, but we don't have specific information about what type of exercises it includes. Let's assume it consists of other exercises that are not focused on resistance training or muscle building. Step 3: Compare the given information Based on the information given, tip A (weight lifting) directly contributes to the growth of skeletal muscles due to the nature of resistance training. Tip B does not involve weight lifting, and the exercises included in this tip might not contribute to muscle growth as much as weight lifting does.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: In what year was the Rokeby Venus badly destroyed? ?  The Rokeby Venus (; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or  La Venus del espejo) is a painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age.  Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.","output":"The Rokeby Venus was badly damaged in the year 1914. It was attacked by suffragette Mary Richardson, but was eventually fully restored and returned to display."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.  Paragraph :  Longer wavelength electromagnetic waves have lower frequencies, and shorter wavelength waves have higher frequencies.  Question:   John was testing a radio wave and had an interesting finding. The shorter the wavelength was, the frequency became Higher or Lower? The answer is:","output":"The answer is Higher. In the given paragraph, it is stated that shorter wavelength electromagnetic waves have higher frequencies. In John's testing of a radio wave, he observed an interesting finding where the shorter the wavelength, the frequency became higher. This observation is consistent with the information provided in the paragraph.  As the wavelength decreases, the frequency increases because wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional to each other. This inverse relationship can be represented by the equation: c = λf where \\"c\\" is the speed of light, \\"λ\\" (lambda) represents the wavelength, and \\"f\\" is the frequency of the wave. As the wavelength (λ) decreases, the frequency (f) must increase to maintain the equality. In the context of radio waves, these principles govern how different radio signals can be transmitted and received simultaneously without interfering with each other. With shorter wavelengths, the radio waves can have higher frequencies, which enable them to carry more information in a given period of time. This aspect is beneficial in modern communication systems such as mobile phones, Wi-Fi, and satellite communication, where large amounts of data need to be transmitted quickly. In summary, John's finding that the shorter the wavelength of radio waves, the higher the frequency is, aligns with the given information, and this relationship has practical applications in various aspects of wireless communication technology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A boarding school pupil hanged herself in her bathroom at home after leaving a note that simply said: 'I'm sorry', an inquest heard today. Tragic Millicent Waddell, 16, locked herself in the bathroom of her mother's £400,000 home before taking her own life. Her horrified mum, Louisa-Kate Foster, discovered her body after breaking into the room when her daughter failed to respond to her knocking on the door. The inquest at Shepton Mallet, Somerset, heard Millie had become unhappy after moving from her father Robert Waddell's home in London to her mother's house in Somerset. But Tony Williams, coroner for East Somerset, said there was 'no prior indication' that the teenager would harm herself. Reading a statement from Millie's mother, who did not attend the inquest, Mr Williams said: 'Millicent had wanted to stay in London but things had not worked out and so Millicent came, in early April, to live with her mother. 'Millicent was in the process of deciding whether she wanted to go to college or find a job. 'She was angry with her situation. She wanted to stay in London but there was no indication that she might self harm in any way.' Millie attended Sexey's School in Bruton, Somerset, a Church of England state boarding school which charges up to £8,400 a year. Mrs Foster's statement told how she returned to their home in Norton-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, at 5.40pm on the day of Millie's death, May 29 last year, but did not see her daughter. She later heard the shower running in the bathroom and knocked on the door at 7.20pm but did not receive a reply. The mother left home for a meeting and returned at 9.15pm - when she found the door still locked.Mr Williams added: 'She decided she would need to force the door.' Ms Foster forced her way into the room and found her daughter hanged, he told the court. 'A note was found at the property in Millicent's handwriting that simply read: \\"I'm sorry\\",' he added. Robert Waddell, Millie's father, provided a statement confirming there had been no concerns that she would harm herself before her death. Police attended the £400,000 detached home but could not save Millie. 'Unhappy': Millicent, known as Millie, attended Sexey's School, a Church of England boarding school in Bruton, Somerset. A toxicology report later showed she had 79mg of alcohol per 100ml - the maximum for driving is 80mg. No prescription or illegal drugs were found in her system, the inquest heard. Pathologist Dr Robert Blahut, at Yeovil District Hospital, confirmed the cause of Millie's death as hanging. Mr Williams told the inquest at East Somerset Coroner's Court: 'There is no evidence to suggest third party involvement. 'I take into account the note that was left by Millicent with two words explaining her actions. 'Millicent knew while she was in the family home she would not be disturbed while she was in the bathroom. My formal finding is that Millicent took her own life.' The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article details the tragic incident of 16-year-old Millicent Waddell, who took her own life by hanging herself in the bathroom of her mother's home in Somerset.

How is \\"National governments spend 46 %.\\" said in Finnish?","output":"In Finnish, the phrase \\"National governments spend 46 %.\\" can be translated as \\"Kansalliset hallitukset käyttävät 46 %.\\"  Here is a breakdown of the translation: - \\"National governments\\" is translated to \\"Kansalliset hallitukset\\" in Finnish. \\"Kansalliset\\" refers to national and \\"hallitukset\\" means governments. - \\"spend\\" is translated to \\"käyttävät\\", which is the third person plural form of the verb \\"käyttää\\", meaning to use or spend. - \\"46 %\\" remains the same in Finnish as it represents a number and a percentage sign. Thus, the complete phrase \\"Kansalliset hallitukset käyttävät 46 %.\\" means \\"National governments spend 46 %.\\" in Finnish.

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Available choices: a). no; b). yes;","output":"b). yes; Both of these questions are essentially asking the same thing, which is how to get unblocked by someone who has blocked them. They are paraphrased versions of the same question. The first question is more general, while the second question specifically mentions WhatsApp as the platform where the block has taken place. Regardless, they both address the concern of getting unblocked by another person.  Now, I will provide a detailed answer to this concern: When someone blocks you on a platform such as WhatsApp, your connection with them becomes limited, and you lose the ability to interact with them through that application. There are several reasons why someone might block you, such as privacy concerns, personal conflicts, or a simple misunderstanding. Regardless of the reason, you may want to reestablish contact with them. Unblocking yourself from someone who blocked you is not possible through the normal features provided by messaging platforms like WhatsApp. This is due to their commitment to users' privacy and security. However, you can try the following steps to rebuild the connection and potentially get unblocked: 1. Reflect on the reason for the block: Consider the context surrounding the block and try to identify any potential causes that led to this action. If you have wronged the person or made them uncomfortable, you must acknowledge your mistakes before working on rebuilding the connection. 2. Contact them through another platform: If you have other ways to contact the person, such as via email, social media, or phone calls, you can try to reach out to them via those alternate channels. Politely request them to unblock you and explain your situation. 3. Apologize if necessary: If you have wronged the person in any way, be sure to sincerely apologize. Acknowledge your mistakes and express your desire to make amends. This display of genuine remorse may prompt the person to reconsider their decision to block you. 4. Request mutual friends to intervene: If you share mutual friends with the person who blocked you, ask them to mediate the situation. They might be willing to talk to the person on your behalf and help convey your intentions to reconnect. 5. Give them space: Sometimes, the best course of action is to give the person some time and space to process their emotions. After a while, they might unblock you voluntarily if they feel comfortable doing so. 6. Make a new account: Though not a recommended or ethical approach, you could create a new account and try contacting the person from there. However, be cautious, as this may lead to further issues if the person isn't ready to reestablish contact, and it violates the terms of service of many platforms. Always respect the boundaries and wishes of the person who has blocked you. If they decide not to unblock you even after you've tried to address the situation, accept their decision and move on. Building and maintaining healthy relationships is important, but it's also essential to recognize when it's best to let go."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: Who is stabbed by Alexia? is inside the article: The remaining vampire covens are on the verge of annihilation by the Lycans. Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David. Semira has Varga, her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity.

Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape. The pair takes refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira. At Var Dohr, the Nordic Coven stronghold, Elder Vidar reveals that David is the son of High Elder Amelia, and thus the legitimate heir to the Eastern Coven.

He meets the teenage Ptolemy whom is frequently surrounced by an entourage of ministers and advisers, who seem to do most of the thinking and decision-making for him. As a gesture of 'goodwill', the Egyptians present Caesar with Pompey's severed head, but Caesar is not pleased; it is a sorry end for a worthy foe.As Caesar settles in at the palace, Apollodorus (Cesare Danova), disguised as a rug peddler, brings a gift from Cleopatra. When a suspicious Caesar unrolls the rug, he finds Cleopatra herself concealed within. He is intrigued with the young queen's beauty and warm personality as she persuades him to help her take back her thrown from her younger brother.Days later, Cleopatra warns Caesar that her brother has surrounded the palace with his soldiers and that he is vastly outnumbered. Caesar is unconcerned. He orders the Egyptian fleet burned so he can gain control of the harbor. The fire spreads to the city, burning many buildings, including the famous Library of Alexandria. Cleopatra angrily confronts Caesar, but he refuses to pull troops away from the fight with Ptolemy's forces to deal with the fire. In the middle of their spat, Caesar begins kissing her.The Romans hold the main gate to the city after a fierce nightime battle. The next day, the armies of Mithridates arrive on Egyptian soil and drive off the armies of Ptolemy. The following day, Caesar passes judgment in a show trial.

D-I schools include the major collegiate athletic powers, with larger budgets, more elaborate facilities, and more athletic scholarships than Divisions II and III as well as many smaller schools committed to the highest level of intercollegiate competition.  - History. Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities  Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University  consist entirely of chairback seating.)  - A touchdown is a means of scoring in both American and Canadian football. Whether running, passing, returning a kickoff or punt, or recovering a turnover, a team scores a touchdown by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone.  - Canadian football is a form of gridiron football played in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete for territorial control of a field of play long and wide attempting to advance a pointed prolate spheroid ball into the opposing team's scoring area (end zone).  - The Connecticut State Universities (CSU) are part of the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities, the largest public higher education system in Connecticut, and the second largest in New England. The four comprehensive state universities enroll almost 35,000 students and 180,000 alumni. The first of the universities to be founded was Central Connecticut State University, established in 1849 as a normal school for teacher education. Over time the other three institutions were founded as normal schools and in 1959 they were converted into state colleges to reflect their expanded mission. From their founding until 1965, they were overseen by the Connecticut State Department of Education. In 1965 the General Assembly transferred control of the then-colleges to an independent Board of Trustees. In 1983 the four institutions were converted into universities, together constituting the Connecticut State University System.  - The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.  - American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada, and also known as gridiron, is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.  - The College Football Hall of Fame is a hall of fame and museum devoted to college football. In August 2014, the College Football Hall of Fame and Chick-fil-A Fan Experience opened in downtown Atlanta, Georgia. Previously located in South Bend, Indiana, the new Hall of Fame is a attraction located in the heart of Atlantas sports, entertainment and tourism district, and is adjacent to the Georgia World Congress Center and Centennial Olympic Park.  - Grambling State University (GSU) is a historically black, public, coeducational university, located in Grambling, Louisiana. The university is home of College Football Hall of Fame inductee and former head football coach Eddie Robinson, and is listed on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail. The university is a member-school of the University of Louisiana System and Thurgood Marshall College Fund.  - Connecticut is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.

Emiliano Zapata Salazar (Spanish pronunciation: [emi'ljano sa'pata]; 8 August 1879 - 10 April 1919) was a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution, the main leader of the peasant revolution in the state of Morelos, and the inspiration of the agrarian movement called Zapatismo. Zapata was born in the rural village of Anenecuilco in Morelos State, where peasant communities were under increasing pressure from the small landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for sugar cane production with the support of dictator Porfirio Diaz. Zapata early on participated in political movements against Diaz and the landowning hacendados, and when the Revolution broke out in 1910 he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders he formed the Liberation Army of the South of which he soon became the undisputed leader. Meanwhile, the disintegration of the revolution outside of Morelos put pressure on the Zapatistas. As General Arenas had turned over to the constitutionalists, he had secured peace for his region and he remained in control there. This suggested to many revolutionaries that perhaps the time had come to seek a peaceful conclusion to the struggle. A movement within the Zapatista ranks led by former General Vazquez and Zapata's erstwhile adviser and inspiration Otilio Montano moved against the Tlaltizapan headquarters demanding surrender to the Carrancistas. Reluctantly, Zapata had Montano tried for treason and executed (Womack 1983-86).  Zapata began looking for allies among the northern revolutionaries and the southern Felicistas, followers of the Liberalist Felix Diaz. He sent Gildardo Magana as an envoy to communicate with the Americans and other possible sources of support. In the fall of 1917 a force led by Gonzalez and the ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata's brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos taking Cuautla, Zacualpan and Jonacatepec.  Zapata continued his work to try to unite with the national anti-Carrancista movement through the next year, and the constitutionalists did not make further advances. In the winter of 1918 a harsh cold and the onset of the Spanish flu decimated the population of Morelos, causing the loss of a quarter of the total population of the state, almost as many as had been lost to Huerta in 1914. (Womack 311). Furthermore, Zapata began to worry that by the end of the World War, the US would turn its attention to Mexico forcing the Zapatistas to either join the Carrancistas in a national defense or to acquiesce to foreign domination of Mexico. In December 1918 Carrancistas under Gonzalez undertook an offensive campaign taking most of the state of Morelos, and pushing Zapata to retreat. The main Zapatista headquarters were moved to Tochimilco, Puebla, although Tlaltizapan also continued to be under Zapatista control. Through Castro, Carranza issued offers to the main Zapatista generals to join the nationalist cause, with pardon. But apart from Manuel Palafox, who having fallen in disgrace among the Zapatistas had joined the Arenistas, none of the major generals did (Womack 313-14). Zapata emitted statements accusing Carranza of being secretly sympathetic to the Germans (Womack 315). In March Zapata finally emitted an open letter to Carranza urging him for the good of the fatherland to resign his leadership to Vazquez Gomez, by now the rallying point of the anti-constitutionalist movement (Womack 319-20). Having posed this formidable moral challenge to Carranza prior to the upcoming 1920 presidential elections, the Zapatista generals at Tochimilco, Magana and Ayaquica, urged Zapata not to take any risks and to lay low. But Zapata declined, considering that the respect of his troops depended on his active presence at the front (Womack 320-22). How did he handle the pressure beyond this? What were his plans?","output":"As the pressure continued to mount on Emiliano Zapata and the Zapatistas, he sought ways to strengthen his forces and continue resisting the Carrancistas. Though detailed plans of Zapata's strategies during this period are not readily available, it can be inferred from historical records that he took the following steps to handle the pressure and advance his cause: 1. Forming Alliances: Zapata actively sought alliances with other revolutionary factions and anti-Carrancista groups. He had already attempted to forge alliances with northern revolutionaries and the southern Felicistas. This would have expanded his support base, increasing the resources and manpower available to the Zapatistas. 2. Engaging with the Americans: Zapata sent Gildardo Magana as an envoy to communicate with the United States and explore possible support. By reaching out to the Americans, he attempted to gather international backing for his cause and weaken Carranza's position. 3. Guerilla Tactics: As the situation grew more difficult due to the loss of territory and setbacks, the Zapatistas likely relied on guerilla warfare tactics. These tactics would allow them to carry out swift attacks, confuse the enemy, and minimize open confrontation with the more powerful Carrancistas. 4. Inspiring and Maintaining Morale: Zapata understood the importance of his leadership role in maintaining the morale and loyalty of his troops, as evidenced by his refusal to hide or take a step back. By remaining visible, active, and engaged on the front lines, he kept his troops motivated and focused. 5. Challenging Carranza Morally: Zapata continued to challenge the legitimacy of Carranza's leadership on moral grounds, such as accusing him of sympathizing with the Germans and urging him to resign in an open letter. This strategy aimed to undermine Carranza's credibility and win over more supporters to Zapata's cause, particularly in light of the upcoming 1920 presidential elections. In conclusion, Zapata aimed to face the mounting pressure by expanding his support base, seeking international backing, employing guerilla warfare tactics, maintaining troop morale, and challenging the legitimacy of Carranza's rule. Together, these strategies would have helped him to persevere in his struggle against the Carrancistas and fight for the causes he believed in, such as land and social reform for the benefit of peasants and marginalized communities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: The verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix—for example, the imperfective psát (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective napsat (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z- and za-. In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit (to buy) and prodat (to sell) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prodávat. Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action. The verb jít (to go) has the iterative form chodit (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form chodívat (to go regularly). A:","output":"The imperfective verbs are derived from the verbs in context by either a removal of a prefix or by changing the infinitive ending. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix such as na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z-, and za- while the imperfective verb does not have this prefix. For example, the imperfective verb \\"psát\\" (to write, to be writing) and its perfective counterpart \\"napsat\\" (to write down, to finish writing).

Q: The mechanical and digestive processes have one goal: to convert food into molecules small enough to be absorbed by the epithelial cells of what?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Absorption The mechanical and digestive processes have one goal: to convert food into molecules small enough to be absorbed by the epithelial cells of the intestinal villi. The absorptive capacity of the alimentary canal is almost endless. Each day, the alimentary canal processes up to 10 liters of food, liquids, and GI secretions, yet less than one liter enters the large intestine. Almost all ingested food, 80 percent of electrolytes, and 90 percent of water are absorbed in the small intestine. Although the entire small intestine is involved in the absorption of water and lipids, most absorption of carbohydrates and proteins occurs in the jejunum. Notably, bile salts and vitamin B12 are absorbed in the terminal ileum. By the time chyme passes from the ileum into the large intestine, it is essentially indigestible food residue (mainly plant fibers like cellulose), some water, and millions of bacteria (Figure 23.32).

Context: Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction. Answer:","output":"The opposite of externally in the context provided is \\"internally.\\" The context discusses Mill's position on mathematics as a species of inductive inference and highlights that mathematical science operates through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures rather than relying on external sensory experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Former members Heather and Gary Botting compare the cultural paradigms of the religion to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-four, and Alan Rogerson describes the religion's leadership as totalitarian.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. My husband and I had been planning a trip to visit friends in Glendale when we found out one of them was allergic to dogs. That meant we needed to find a place to board him close by and in a hurry. The Furshire seemed like the perfect place. Every time I called my call was received by friendly, enthusiastic staff.   Being that we are from out of state and our dog isn't used to the hot weather in Arizona, my husband was worried it might be too warm for our pooch. We insisted on a tour before completing paperwork, just in case we didn't feel comfortable. We were given whirlwind tour and felt that our dog would be comfortable. All the other dogs there, either boarders or day care drop-offs, all seemed happy. When we saw the pool we thought this was without a doubt a great place. We completed the tour, signed off on the paperwork and were on our way.   We only left our dog for two nights, dropping him off on Thursday afternoon and picking him up early Saturday morning. We received pictures of him playing with other dogs in the pool and felt at ease.  When we picked him up, the employee who greeted us and brought him out was friendly enough and let us know that he had been a good boy, had really enjoyed the pool and been a quiet dog. The last part of her statement worried me a bit as he is a quiet dog at home, but not so much when we aren't with him. When she brought him out he was thrilled to see us and gave us as enthusiastic a greeting as he could. I was given the bag containing his food and immediately noticed that out of the five servings we had provided for his feeding, three were being returned. When we got him in the car and headed off down the road I started to get really worried. His tongue was darker than usual and he wouldn't stop panting. He also had a scrape on his nose. I asked my husband to pull over so that we could walk him, just in case having to \\"go\\" was the problem. It wasn't. I then gave him water (about a cup) which he immediately drank up. I went into the convenience store, bought him a big bottle of water and he drank almost the entire bottle. He was completely dehydrated!  That wasn't the end of it. We were on our way to my husband's high school reunion, about an hour's drive north of Phoenix. Our dog was completely knocked out the entire drive. When we arrived there and walked him he finally \\"went\\" and we found that there was blood in his stool. Also, being that we feed him the same food all the time, we could tell he had eaten food other than his own. Later when he was barking to go in the pool we learned he was completely hoarse leading us to believe he had barked himself so. It took two days for our dog to completely recover from his experience at The Furshire. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer had initial positive impressions due to the friendly staff and seemingly comfortable environment at The Furshire. However, after picking up their dog, the reviewer discovered that their dog had been dehydrated, had a scrape on its nose, potentially had consumed different food, and had blood in its stool. They also noticed that their dog's feeding wasn't properly managed as they got three servings of food returned. The reviewer concludes that their dog's overall experience at The Furshire was not satisfactory, which took two days for their dog to recover from.

Article: Story highlights Victims identified      Suspect believed to be in abandoned building      The man is also believed to have blown up his house, source says      Schools and a hospital were in lockdown      A man suspected of killing four people and injuring two others in a 10-minute shooting spree in Herkimer County, New York, is believed to be surrounded by police, authorities said Wednesday.      The upstate New York man also is believed to have blown up his house, according to a federal law enforcement source briefed on the investigation.      Policing searching for Kurt R. Myers, 64, surrounded an abandoned building, State Police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico and Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Myers ditched his vehicle following shootings at a barber shop and an auto maintenance business, police said.      Officials provided no possible motive.      Schools and a hospital in the Mohawk Valley area, about 70 miles west-northwest of Albany, went into lockdown while police searched for the suspect.      Police first received a report of a fire at a residence at 9:29 a.m., D'Amico said. The call was followed minutes later with reports of shootings at John's Barber Shop in Mohawk and Gaffey's Fast Lube in Herkimer, authorities said.      Myers allegedly spoke with individuals at the barber shop before firing multiple rounds, D'Amico said.      Harry Montgomery, 68, and Michael Rancier, 57, were pronounced dead at the scene. Two other people were in critical condition at St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Utica.      Gaffey's employee Thomas Stefka and Michael Renshaw, a 20-year veteran of the State Department of Corrections, were killed at the auto business.      Police believe Myers drove away from the auto shop and left his vehicle outside an abandoned building in Herkimer before shooting at officers, D'Amico said. No officers were injured during the shootout.      Cuomo said he came to Herkimer to make sure the state was providing as many resources as possible.      \\"This is truly an inexplicable situation; there was no apparent, rational motive to the best of our knowledge ... to provoke these attacks,\\" Cuomo said. \\"These are the types of peaceful, quiet communities that one would say 'this could never happen here,'\\" he said, referring to Mohawk and Herkimer.      \\"We're concerned about officer safety, so we're in no rush to bring this to a conclusion; we want to make sure no one else gets injured today,\\" D'Amico said.      A 1973 drunken driving arrest is the only past incident on Myers' record, D'Amico told the media.      Reporters on Wednesday pressed Cuomo about New York's new gun-control laws, which were the first in the nation to be enacted after the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre.      The laws fortified New York's existing assault weapons ban, limited the number of bullets allowed in magazines and strengthened rules that govern the mentally ill, which included a requirement to report potentially harmful behavior.      Cuomo said he would discuss the laws later.      \\"Gun violence has been with us for a long, long time,\\" the governor said. \\"I think the challenge for government, the challenge for society, is to do the best that it can.\\" ||||| Authorities in upstate New York say the suspected gunman in a rampage at a car wash and a barbershop that left four people dead has been killed by police in a shootout.

Hours later, a flurry of gunfire was heard near where police had narrowed their search.      A college and schools were locked down, and people told to stay inside as police hunted Myers.      THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.      A 64-year-old loner sauntered into a barbershop in upstate New York, coolly asked if the man cutting hair remembered him and then opened fire with a shotgun, the first shots in a burst of violence that would leave four dead, two critically wounded and people in this small village aching to find out what set the gunman off.      New York state police vowed to wait out Kurt Myers, the man suspected of gunning down the victims then holing up in an abandoned building. Police kept vigilant watch there Thursday morning, periodically blaring sirens in an apparent attempt to encourage Myers to surrender, if alive. Booms also were heard.      Police said Thursday they are confident he is still in the building, but don't know if he's dead or alive.      John Seymour, one of the men wounded in the attacks told his sister, Mary Hornett, the barbershop attack came out of nowhere.      \\"He just said that the guys were in the barbershop and this guy comes in and he says, \`Hi John, do you remember me?' and my brother said, \`Yes, Kurt, how are you?' and then he just started shooting,\\" Hornett said.      Hornett said her brother, who was hospitalized in critical condition, was doing well after being shot in the left hand and right hip.      \\"My brother couldn't think of any reason why he would do such a thing,\\" she said of Myers, a former customer who hadn't been in the shop for a couple of years.      Officers were fired on from the abandoned building on Wednesday afternoon while looking for Myers, state police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico said. At least one officer returned fire.      \\"We're in no rush to bring this to a conclusion,\\" D'Amico said, adding that the main objective was to make sure no one else was hurt.      The shootings shattered the peace and rattled the nerves of Mohawk and Herkimer, two small villages about 170 miles northwest of New York City, separated from each other by the Mohawk River and the New York State Thruway. Police snipers waited on rooftops on a block of small businesses in Herkimer as they waited for Myers to emerge.      Police said Myers' rampage started with a fire in his apartment in the nearby village of Mohawk at about 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. He then drove to John's Barber Shop around the corner and used a shotgun to kill two customers, D'Amico said, identifying them as Harry Montgomery, 68, and Michael Ransear, 57, a retired corrections officer. In addition to Seymour, the shop's owner, another customer, Dan Haslauer, also was listed in critical condition at a Utica hospital.      The gunman then drove to Gaffy's Fast Lube in nearby Herkimer and used the shotgun to kill Michael Renshaw and Thomas Stefka. Renshaw was a 23-year employee of the state corrections department who worked at Mid-State Correctional Facility near Utica. Stefka worked at Gaffey's and attended Mohawk Reform Church, where he played guitar during services.      Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in a press conference in Herkimer, called it \\"truly an inexplicable situation.\\"      \\"There's no apparent motive to the best of our knowledge at this time to provoke these attacks,\\" he said.      Police had not had any communication with Myers, whose only known police record was a 1973 drunken-driving arrest, D'Amico said.      Police were positioned in front of a block of small businesses topped with apartments in the village of Herkimer on Wednesday evening.      A local businessman, jeweler Fred Weisser, said police were trying to get people out while Myers was believed to be in a building next door.      \\"They're sending in a robot to check the place out,\\" he said by telephone. \\"I guess we're stuck. We're between him and the cops. I don't want to step out and get clipped by a sniper.\\"      Myles Smith, who lives in one of the apartments above the shops, said by cellphone he had heard police trying to talk to Myers.      \\"The snipers on the roof are sitting there,\\" Smith said. \\"I ain't seen a whole lot of movement. I heard about five gunshots. I keep hearing them trying to talk him out, but I don't think he's coming out.\\"      The rear of the small building where Myers lived was burned out, and police continued to guard the building, where they found guns and ammunition. It was unclear if they were in his apartment.      Neighbors said they barely knew Myers, who rarely spoke, left every morning in his red Jeep and came back.      Traci Randall said the only time she remembers speaking to her next-door neighbor was when he yelled at her son because he thought he had shot an air pellet at his Jeep.      \\"He would walk by himself. He was kind of a loner. No wife,\\" she said.      Neighbors said he never had visitors or friends. Gary Urich said Myers wouldn't even say much as \`Hi' to him when walking by his porch.      \\"I said, \`How are you doing?' No response. He just walked by,\\" he said.      Michele Mlinar, a bartender at Cangee's Bar and Grille in Herkimer, said Myers frequently went in and had a bottle or two of Coors Light and left without speaking to anyone. She said he was always alone and she didn't even know his name until police released his mug shot on Wednesday.      Cangee's owner Candy Rellin called Myers \\"just an odd little man.\\"      The two villages are about 65 miles east of Syracuse on opposite sides of the Mohawk River _ which connects the Erie Canal to the Hudson River and from there, the sea _ in a region known as the Mohawk Valley.      James Baron, the mayor of Mohawk described his village as close-knit and friendly, \\"the kind of place where you'd say, \`Oh, it would never happen here.'\\"      Elizabeth Cirelli was shocked by Stefka's slaying. He was a neighbor in Herkimer.      \\"He was a great guy, a really nice person. This is horrific. We really couldn't believe it,\\" she said.      Herkimer County Community College lifted a lockdown during the afternoon, and schools near the scene released students. D'Amico said most of the three-block neighborhood around the search scene was evacuated.      Herkimer is a village of 7,700 named for the German immigrant family that settled in the western Mohawk Valley in the 1720s. The economically distressed villages are 2 miles away from Ilion, where a 2-century-old Remington Arms gun plant is a major employer.      ___      Associated Press writers Chris Carola and Mary Esch in Albany and Tom McElroy in New York contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","output":"In Herkimer County, New York, a man suspected of killing four people and injuring two others in a shooting spree is believed to be surrounded by police. The suspect is also believed to have blown up his house. The motive for the attacks is unclear. Schools and a hospital in the area were placed on lockdown while police searched for the suspect. The shootings took place at a barber shop and an auto maintenance business.

Question: Who or what does Roman trade to Sabian in exchange for restoring the building's electricity? Title: The Negotiator Movie plot: Lieutenant Danny Roman (Jackson) is a top police hostage negotiator. When he cannot talk a hostage-taker into surrendering, he offers himself as an additional hostage and lures the subject into a position where he can be taken down with the minimum use of force, rather than an all-out assault.Roman is middle-aged and recently married. While celebrating his most recent success, he is approached by his colleague Nathan 'Nate' Roenick (Guilfoyle) who warns him that large sums of money are being embezzled from the Chicago Police Department's disability fund of which Roman is on the board. Roenick has an informant with whom he was at the Police Academy and served with for a while, but refuses to name him. Later that evening, Roman is summoned via his pager for another meeting with Roenick but instead finds him dead by gunshot wounds.The case goes badly for Roman when it is assigned to Inspector Niebaum (Walsh) of the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) whom Roenick claimed was part of the embezzling. Furthermore the gun used to kill Roenick was one of three that were part of a case Roman handled in the past: two were recovered but not the third. Documents found in Roman's house indicate that the money has gone to an offshore account of which he denies any knowledge.Facing serious charges, suspended from the force and rejected by his friends, including Roenick's widow, a frustrated Roman storms into Niebaum's office and, in the chaos that follows, takes him and several others hostage, including his personal assistant Maggie (Fallon), police Commander Grant Frost (Rifkin) and two-bit con-man Rudy Timmons (Giamatti).With the building evacuated and placed under siege by police and FBI, Roman issues his conditions which include finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lieutenant Chris Sabian (Spacey), another top negotiator. Sabian, who has been trying rather unsuccessfully to negotiate peace between his sulking wife (Keller) and cheeky daughter (Mulrooney), arrives on the scene. Roman and Sabian have only met once...

Trump launched a new attack on the Russia probe in the wake of a critical report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Justice. “I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy. It was critical of the man Trump fired as FBI director, James Comey, but rejected the notion of a politically-directed effort aimed at Trump. “This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review,\\" announced current FBI Director Christopher Wray. Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.  During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization. Nobody wants to report that. I got along with him great. We have a great chemistry together.

(CNN) -- It's laughable to watch political prognosticators on the various TV shows weigh in on Rahm Emanuel's chances of becoming the next mayor of Chicago, Illinois. If you trust any of them, you swear President Barack Obama's outgoing chief of staff sees the position as a birthright that he is about to assume now that Richard M. Daley is stepping down. Folks, don't buy the national media hype. As they say, all politics is local, and in this case, Emanuel has a long way to go before he can even think of moving into the fifth floor mayoral suite. But in a city that is used to","output":"big personalities, towering political dynasties, and heavily contested mayoral elections, Emanuel's candidacy comes as no surprise to Chicagoans. The former congressman and White House operative has experience in navigating the complex world of politics, both on a local and national stage. However, being connected to power isn't enough to guarantee him a smooth ride in this urban jungle. Chicago's rich political history and deeply ingrained identity could prove to be more challenging for Emanuel than initially anticipated. The Windy City's residents are known for their fierce loyalty to local institutions and strong bonds to their neighborhoods. Thus, any mayoral hopeful has to be prepared not only to rally support behind major policies but also to address and understand the nuanced needs and concerns of the city's diverse communities. Emanuel has already faced criticism for his direct style and close connection to the Obama presidency. Some see him as an outsider trying to impose his worldview onto a city that has a rich history of resisting change from non-native politicians. Furthermore, Emanuel's ties to the elite world of Washington may not sit well with some working-class Chicagoans who value the local grassroots connections their city was built upon. To succeed, Rahm Emanuel must balance his tough, no-nonsense attitude with an ability to forge connections with people from all walks of life in Chicago. He must tackle the city's urgent challenges – including gun violence, an ever-looming debt crisis, and a struggling public school system – while also crafting a vision for the city's future that resonates with its residents. Overcoming these obstacles will not be easy, and Emanuel might have to learn how to adapt to the local political terrain in a way he's never done before. But as the race to fill Mayor Daley's shoes intensifies, Emanuel has the opportunity to prove—to Chicago and the nation—that he is more than just a capable leader. He has the chance to redefine what it means to be a mayor in a city renowned for its political grit and resilience. As Chicagoans prepare to cast their ballots, it remains to be seen if Rahm Emanuel can successfully forge a path that will lead him to the coveted fifth floor mayoral suite. But one thing is certain: in the rough-and-tumble world of Chicago politics, nothing is taken for granted, and Emanuel's journey to City Hall will be anything but predictable. So, as the national media jumps from one conclusion to the next, let us remember that Chicago's electorate can be an unpredictable force, and the path to the mayor's office is one fraught with twists, turns, and relentless challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the question: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. South Korean officials said there is possibility that Moon may join Trump in Singapore to help negotiate a nuclear deal with Kim, as the...

It shows a scene from the Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying and challenges him to either accept his own execution or to kill Candaules as a punishment. Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, still unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes. Etty hoped that his audience would take from the painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights should justly be punished, but he made little effort to explain this to audiences. The painting was immediately controversial and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, and in 1847 was one of a number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The work retained its controversial reputation in later years, and when The Art Journal bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's former collection in 1849 they did not distribute reproductions of Candaules.

Mrs. Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London, England. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby and Judy (Christopher Severn and Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) at university. They have live-in staff: Gladys the housemaid (Brenda Forbes) and Ada the cook (Marie De Becker).As World War II looms, Vin comes down from university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreements (mainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruism) they fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal.Several months later, as the war comes closer to home with the bombing of Great Brittan, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot.

Summarize the following: It is essential to get a checkup at your vet before your travel in order to receive a health certificate, often required for airline travel, and proof of vaccination. Many transportation services open to the public (trains, planes, boats) require a health certificate and proof of vaccination before agreeing to transport your dog.  Carry all of your dog’s documentation with you while you are travelling to avoid any issues with veterinary border control or emergency illnesses. Depending on where you're traveling, your pet's health certificate may need to be issued no earlier than 10 days before your travel date. While you're at the vet, be sure to stock up on all necessary medications. If you are flying or driving to another country, be sure to check for their immigration and veterinary border control policies. Contact the airline you are traveling with as well as the border control for the country you will be arriving in to find out what restrictions and laws you need to abide by.k  Some countries will require your dog to have specific vaccinations. They may also require your dog to be quarantined for a certain amount of time upon arrival at their border. Consult the airline you are travelling with to be put in touch with veterinary border control. Some airlines will not transport certain dog breeds, and some airlines won't fly dogs in extreme heat or cold. Crating your dog is recommended for both their and your safety. Before crating, be sure to exercise your dog so that they are more comfortable resting. Go for an extra long walk or run before putting your dog in the car or arriving at the airport. Whether you are driving or flying you’ll eventually need to find a dog-friendly hotel. Ask your hotel what their pet policies are when you are booking.  Some hotels charge extra for animals, and some have breed and size restrictions. Bring extra waste bags and wipes in case your dog has an accident at the hotel. Find out if your accommodation is near a park, lake, trail, or field that you and your dog can walk to for exercise and bathroom breaks. It comes in handy for cuts, ticks and the like. It will give you peace of mind if nothing else! Make sure your kit also includes any medications that your dog might need. Emergency kits should contain all of your dog’s relevant paperwork, a nylon leash, muzzle, and various medical supplies like hydrogen peroxide, gauze, bandages, tweezers, and adhesive tape. Sedating your dog can often cause unwanted complications as most sedatives will reduce your dog’s response to pressure and climate changes. Instead of sedating your dog, be sure to give them plenty of exercise before crating and have drinking water close by. Consult your vet if you are concerned that your dog may be in need of a sedative or tranquilizer while travelling. Summary:","output":"Before you travel with your dog, you need to visit the vet to make sure they are healthy and have all their shots. You'll get some important papers that you need to take with you. Some countries and airlines have special rules, so ask them what you need to do. It's also a good idea to crate your dog, go for a long walk before traveling, and find a hotel that likes pets. Also, bring a special kit with medicine and supplies for your dog, just in case. Try not to give your dog any sleeping medicine, instead make sure they have lots of exercises and water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. I read this background article the other day: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

None were produced before Japan's surrender that ended World War II.","output":"The sentence 'The Rikugun Ki-202 flies' cannot be determined to be true based on the text provided. In the text, it is stated that the Rikugun Ki-202 \\"Shūsui-Kai\\", while being a development of the German Messerschmitt Me 163 \\"Komet\\" rocket-powered interceptor aircraft, was not produced before Japan's surrender which ended World War II. This implies that the plane did not reach production before the end of the war. Without additional information concerning post-war production or testing activities, we cannot draw comprehensive conclusions about whether the Rikugun Ki-202 ever reached a state where it was capable of flight.  However, given the specific wording of the sentence in question, it is reasonable to conclude that without a completed production process, a prototype - if it even existed - would have unlikely been able to fly. Furthermore, there is no recorded historical evidence of operational Rikugun Ki-202 aircrafts, supporting the narrative that the model never saw flight. Also, it's essential to know that plane construction doesn't necessarily guarantee flight. It's possible for aircraft to be built but remain grounded because of engineering issues, safety concerns, or a lack of necessary resources, such as fuel or trained pilots. In the case of the Rikugun Ki-202, even if some form of production occurred after Japan's surrender, there is no provided evidence to suggest it ever successfully flew.

He says that \\"the gravitational pull of the Moon on Earth 's oceans causes the tides\\" and \\"rivers drain into the Pacific Ocean\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What does the gravitational pull of the moon cause?\\" based on the hints given by the teacher is that the gravitational pull of the Moon on Earth causes the tides. The gravitational force between the Moon and Earth is mainly responsible for causing tidal fluctuations on our planet. Earth and its oceans are consistently pulled toward the Moon due to this gravitational attraction. As Earth rotates each day, different regions of its surface pass the point closest to the Moon, which results in water in these areas being pulled towards the Moon, producing high tides. Moreover, since the gravitational pull is not uniform across Earth, water also accumulates on the opposite side of the planet, forming another high tide area at the same time.  This occurs because the gravitational force is weaker further from the moon, causing a stretching effect that results in two tidal bulges. In addition to the high tides, low tides also occur when the water moves away from the areas experiencing high tides. Essentially, high tides and low tides occur in an alternating pattern, approximately every six hours, as Earth rotates. The teacher's second hint about rivers draining into the Pacific Ocean is not directly related to the main effect of the Moon's gravitational pull on Earth. However, it might be worth noting that tides can have an impact on river water levels near river mouths that open into the oceans. In these cases, tidal fluctuations can lead to changes in the water levels of estuaries, deltas, and other coastal zones, which could influence the flow of rivers and their tributaries into the ocean. In conclusion, the essential answer to the question is that the gravitational pull of the Moon on Earth mainly causes the tides, influencing the rise and fall of water levels in the oceans and, to some extent, nearby rivers and coastal areas."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Movie disk would not play Review: Purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my six year old Grandson. Movie disk would not play when opened on Christmas day. Features disk worked OK. One star is not for product but for dealer. Movie when it works gets five stars. Understanding that this can happen any time with a DVD I requested the dealer to provide a replacement but he indicated that it was out of stock and provided a refund instead. However a check of that dealers site that day showed that he had 16 copies of the exact product that I ordered in stock and available for sale. It was apparently easier for him to provide a refund than to fix the problem. Some customer service, I will never make another purchase from this dealer again. The answer to this question is:","output":"The customer was dissatisfied. Although they enjoyed the movie itself and gave it five stars, they were unhappy with the dealer's customer service and the fact that the movie disk would not play. The dealer's response and refusal to provide a replacement, despite having copies in stock, also contributed to the customer's dissatisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Then follows a montage of videos taken over the Beindorfs 18-year-long marriage... which is an anniversary gift from Grover and Stacy. Unfortunately, Ned and Janet drop a bombshell on their children: they are considering a separation. A depressed Grover confides in his best friend Matt Finley, whose father Vic never keeps a wife for more than two years, who says if it was to him hed lock them in a closet until they sorted things out. This gives Grover an idea...That night, Grover and Stacy dress up the basement in a Hawaiian décor, inspired by their parents honeymoon in that country, and invite their parents down there for dinner in an attempt for reconciliation.

Answer:","output":"\\"Love Locked: A Family Reunion\\" The film \\"Love Locked: A Family Reunion\\" is an engaging and heartwarming story revolving around Grover Beindorf, his sister Stacey, and their hardworking parents, Ned and Janet. Set in the idyllic suburbs of Ohio, the Beindorf family is pushed to the brink when Ned and Janet announce their decision to separate after 18 years of marriage. Inspired by his best friend Matt Finley's offhand remark about locking his parents in a closet until they reconcile, Grover comes up with an ingenious plan. The siblings transform their basement into a Hawaiian-themed escape reminiscent of their parents' honeymoon in a last-ditch attempt to rekindle their love. Despite their well-intentioned efforts, Ned and Janet's arguments continue to escalate during the Hawaiian dinner, leading Grover and Stacey to lock them in the basement, vowing not to release them until they resolve their issues and return to a loving partnership. As word spreads about Grover's bold move, the notorious school bully, TJ Krupp, becomes enamored with the idea and decides to take matters into his own hands. He not only beefs up the security measures on the Beindorf basement door but also locks his own dysfunctional parents, Donald and Gwenna Krupp, in alongside Ned and Janet. Matt, not wanting to be left out and hoping to keep his father, Vic, married to his current wife, Louise, follows suit. The engaging and unconventional dynamics in the basement eventually give rise to the couples beginning to reevaluate their relationships and address their differences more constructively. The journey of self-discovery and the importance of communication begin to surface, shedding new light on their marriages. Outside the basement, Grover develops a newfound bond with his long-time crush, Brooke Figler, as they confide in each other about their family struggles. This shared vulnerability fosters a genuine connection between the two teenagers, adding an extra layer of warmth and sincerity to the movie. \\"Love Locked: A Family Reunion\\" artfully navigates themes of love, forgiveness, and the complexities of family dynamics, while taking audiences through moments of laughter, tension, and heartfelt emotions.

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it’s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.

Information:  - The phrase territorial police force varies in precise meaning according to the country to which it is related, generally distinguishing a force whose area of responsibility is defined by sub-national boundaries from others which deal with the entire country or a restricted range of crime.  - A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \\"molecule\\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions.  - A police officer, also known as a policewoman, policeman, police agent is a warranted law employee of a police force. In the United States, \\"officer\\" usually is the formal name of the lowest police rank. In many other countries, \\"officer\\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank, and the lowest rank is often \\"constable\\". In some nations the use of the rank \\"officer\\" is legally reserved for military personnel. Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of criminals and the prevention and detection of crime, protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some police officers may also be trained in special duties, such as counter-terrorism, surveillance, child protection, VIP protection, civil law enforcement, and investigation techniques into major crime including fraud, rape, murder, and drug trafficking. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to dissimulate as ordinary citizens.  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.  - A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.  - Nucleic acids are biopolymers, or large biomolecules, essential to all known forms of life. They are composed of monomers, which are nucleotides made of three components: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. If the sugar is a simple ribose, the polymer is RNA (ribonucleic acid); if the sugar is derived from ribose as deoxyribose, the polymer is DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).  - A macromolecule is a very large molecule, such as protein, commonly created by polymerization of smaller subunits (monomers). They are typically composed of thousands of atoms or more. The most common macromolecules in biochemistry are biopolymers (nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates and polyphenols) and large non-polymeric molecules (such as lipids and macrocycles). Synthetic macromolecules include common plastics and synthetic fibres as well as experimental materials such as carbon nanotubes.  - James Mackay QPM retired as Deputy Chief Constable of Tayside Police in 2001 . He has had considerable experience of criminal investigation and major inquiries .

Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as \\"living\\". Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved.  - Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with proteins and carbohydrates, constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins.

Article:The ring of steel surrounding Cardiff Castle was condemned by taxi drivers and traders for causing chaos since it was erected two weeks before the event. First Minister Carwyn Jones thanked people for their tolerance, saying it would benefit Wales in the long term. There was minimal disruption around the main summit venue, the Celtic Manor Resort on the outskirts of Newport. More than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates and 1,500 journalists were in south Wales on Thursday and Friday for one of the biggest international events ever to take place in the UK. With the summit taking place on the eastern outskirts of Newport there was little disruption in the city itself, but parts of central Cardiff were sealed off completely in advance of dinners for the visitors at Cardiff Castle and the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama on Thursday. Several shops in the centre of Cardiff closed their doors during the summit, complaining that trade had fallen since the security fences first went up in mid-August. Cardiff council called in contractors to start dismantling the city centre barriers on Friday and promised they would be cleared by Sunday afternoon ready for the start of the working week. Ramesh Patel, cabinet member for transport, said: \\"I would like to thank residents, visitors and commuters for their patience with the security measures that needed to be put in place by the security services. \\"The priority of the administration is to get the fence line taken out of the city centre as quickly as possible and this is why contractors will be working around the clock to make this happen. \\"We will then be working with our partners to get the fence taken down from Bute Park and Cardiff Bay as quickly as possible.\\" The following road closures will remain in effect while the work takes place: However, the council has warned of other road closures on Sunday morning in the Cathays and Roath areas of the city for the Cardiff 10K charity run. There had been warnings of likely traffic congestion on the M4 in south Wales on Friday afternoon as the summit drew to a close and delegates departed, but there were no serious delays. Cardiff Airport had opened a temporary terminal to handle Nato-related traffic with an extra 100 staff on duty to run it, with some road restrictions remaining in place until midnight on Friday. Road closures in Newport around the Celtic Manor Resort were lifted early on Saturday morning. First Minister Carwyn Jones paid tribute to people and businesses in south Wales for supporting the summit, and their tolerance of some \\"inevitable disruption\\" from the security and logistical operation. \\"I am firmly of the view that the benefits to Wales greatly outweighed any short term disruption,\\" he said. Protest marches in Newport and Cardiff passed off largely peacefully, with four people arrested in Cardiff. Around 100 people had set up a peace camp at Tredegar Park, on the western side of Newport, representing a range of causes. A further four arrests were made on Friday, after protestors entered a bank in Newport and two people attached themselves to a barrier. The incident happened at Barclays on Commercial Street just after 15:20 BST. A spokesperson for the joint Nato policing operation said four people had been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass.

When the People's Republic was established in 1945, the Party gave high priority to wiping out illiteracy. As part of a vast social campaign, anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn. By 1955, illiteracy was virtually eliminated among Albania's adult population. Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male literacy rate is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%. With large population movements in the 1990s to urban areas, the provision of education has undergone transformation as well. The University of Tirana is the oldest university in Albania, having been founded in October 1957.

TiVo Posts Profit as Revenue Rises 4% TiVo posted a quarterly profit for only the third time in its 11-year history on Wednesday as the pioneer in digital video recorders improved margins on hardware and reduced marketing costs. It was also the first time TiVo had back-to-back quarters of profit. The company reported 2.9 million in net income, or 3 cents a share, compared with a loss of 17.7 million, or 18 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Analysts polled by ThomsonReuters had expected a loss of 2 cents a share in the quarter that ended July 31. Revenue in the period, which ended July 31 and was the second quarter of TiVo’s fiscal year, rose 4 percent to 65.2 million, including 53.5 million in services and technology. TiVo’s subscriber base has been dropping because of increased competition from generic recorders offered by cable and satellite operators.

When World War II started, tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of non-discrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence.

By Beth Stebner and Reuters Reporter PUBLISHED: 20:29 EST, 13 March 2013 | UPDATED: 05:36 EST, 14 March 2013 The architect of Google’s Android’s operating system, Andy Rubin, is stepping down unexpectedly after a seven-year stint in the job. The surprise change was announced by Google on Wednesday and could raise new questions about Android’s direction as Google competes with Apple, Microsoft, and other tech companies rushing to gain ground in the lucrative mobile computing market. In his place, Google has appointed Sundar Pichai, the executive overseeing its Chrome web browser and applications like Google Drive and Gmail, to take over Rubin's spot. In 2008, Pichai aggressively pushed Google's Chrome browser, when OPTIONS: - Android's Explorer lorded over the market. - Andy Rubin's Explorer lorded over the market. - Apple's Explorer lorded over the market. - Beth Stebner's Explorer lorded over the market. - Chrome's Explorer lorded over the market. - Drive's Explorer lorded over the market. - Galaxy S IV's Explorer lorded over the market. - Gmail's Explorer lorded over the market. - Google's Explorer lorded over the market. - Google Drive's Explorer lorded over the market. - Microsoft's Explorer lorded over the market. - New York's Explorer lorded over the market. - Reuters's Explorer lorded over the market. - Rubin's Explorer lorded over the market. - Samsung's Explorer lorded over the market. - Sundar Pichai's Explorer lorded over the market.","output":"In 2008, Pichai aggressively pushed Google's Chrome browser when Microsoft's Internet Explorer lorded over the market. This was a bold move by Pichai, as Microsoft's Internet Explorer had dominated the browser market for several years, with rivals like Mozilla Firefox and Apple's Safari fighting to gain a foothold. Under Pichai's leadership, Google Chrome quickly gained traction and soon became a formidable competitor in the browser market. By focusing on speed, stability, and frequent updates, Google's Chrome browser revolutionized the way people experienced the internet. It introduced several new features, such as syncing across multiple devices, an omnibox for search and url input, and the quick incorporation of new web standards. As a result of Pichai's strategic direction, Google Chrome has since overtaken Microsoft's Internet Explorer as the world's most used web browser. It is now considered the gold standard for web browsing, continuing to adapt and innovate as new devices and web technologies emerge. In addition to Chrome's success, Pichai has played a critical role in the management and development of other Google products, such as Google Drive and Gmail, ensuring that they remain competitive and relevant in an ever-changing tech landscape. With his proven track record in overseeing popular Google products, it is no surprise that Sundar Pichai was appointed to take over Andy Rubin's position after his unexpected departure. As the new head of Android, Pichai now faces the challenge of steering the world's most widely used mobile operating system in a rapidly evolving market. Some of the potential challenges he may face include dealing with fragmentation issues within the Android ecosystem, ensuring that Google's own suite of applications and services remain competitive on Android devices, and contending with rival operating systems like Apple's iOS and Microsoft's Windows. Furthermore, Pichai must keep an eye on emerging mobile trends to ensure that Android remains at the forefront of mobile innovation. In conclusion, Sundar Pichai's aggressive push for Google's Chrome browser in 2008 marked the beginning of a significant shift in the browser market. His strategic vision and leadership helped propel Google Chrome to become the world's most popular web browser, overtaking Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Pichai's appointment as the head of Android following Rubin's departure showcases Google's confidence in his ability to continue guiding their products to new heights in an increasingly competitive market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Undercover and alone, Agent Brown must navigate through the murky waters of crime and sin that threaten the city and its innocent civilians. Act 1: Establishing the unique culture and charm of New Orleans, we first meet Agent Christopher Brown. He is assigned to investigate allegations of police corruption. Brown is an idealistic man of unwavering integrity, who quickly realizes how deep the roots of corruption go after witnessing the locals' fear of law enforcement. He accepts the challenge to right the wrongs done by those in power. Act 2: Going undercover as a newly transferred police officer, Agent Brown infiltrates the corrupt department. He befriends a veteran cop, Marcus, who was once a good and honest officer but fell prey to the increasing corruption. Marcus senses a glimmer of hope in Brown and ultimately helps him gather evidence of the criminal activity perpetuated by his fellow officers. Meanwhile, Brown discovers that the police have ties to the underworld, including an influential crime lord named Vincent Lucchesi. To maintain control, Vincent blackmails and bribes several officers, including the police chief. In order to bring them all down, Brown must gain Vincent's trust without jeopardizing his cover. Act 3: Brown becomes entangled in a dangerous game as the local mafia boss, Vincent, involves him in high-stakes heists and criminal operations. Simultaneously, Brown collects enough evidence to build a case against Vincent and the corrupt officers. However, the department catches wind of a mole among them and begins hunting him down. In a thrilling finale, Brown is cornered and exposed during a confrontation with the police chief. At the eleventh hour, Marcus comes to his aid, and together, they face down the corrupt officers and Vincent's henchmen in a climactic shootout. The police chief is apprehended, but Vincent escapes, vowing revenge. Epilogue: The movie ends on high note as justice is served, and the corrupt officials are taken into custody. Brown's integrity and determination have made a significant impact in New Orleans. However, the plot leaves a thread of unfinished business with Vincent still at large, leaving room for a potential sequel. And though the city is now a brighter place, the battle between light and darkness continues with Agent Christopher Brown leading the charge for justice."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

(CNN)It's starting to feel a little bit like Groundhog Day when it comes to parents under attack for letting their children do things on their own. The latest case? A Silver Spring, Maryland, couple is facing a neglect investigation for letting their 10-year-old son and 6-1/2-year-old daughter walk home from a playground, about a mile from their house, by themselves on a Saturday afternoon in late December. The story immediately brought to mind the South Carolina mom arrested for letting her 9-year-old daughter play at the park alone while she worked at a McDonald's and a Florida mom arrested after letting her 7-year-old walk to the park alone.","output":"The story immediately brought to mind the South Carolina mom arrested for letting her 9-year-old daughter play at the park alone while she worked at a McDonald's and a Florida mom arrested after letting her 7-year-old walk to the park alone. Both of these incidents, and the one involving the Maryland couple, highlight what many are considering to be a growing trend of overprotective parenting and the criminalization of what was once considered normal childhood independence and autonomy. More and more, parents are facing increasing scrutiny over their decisions and choices, particularly when it comes to allowing their children to engage in unsupervised activities. This heightened awareness is likely due, in part, to the prevalence of social media and the ease with which news stories like these can spread and become the subject of public debate. In these instances, parents are often the target of criticism, with some arguing that they are being reckless with their children's safety, while others insist that they are merely promoting a sense of independence and responsibility in their offspring. One major factor contributing to the increased concern surrounding children's safety is the perception that the world is becoming a more dangerous place for them. Despite statistics that show rates of violent crime against children have actually decreased in recent years, many parents still feel a heightened sense of fear. This could be driven by sensationalized news reporting and an 'availability heuristic' – the idea that people are more likely to overestimate the prevalence of a problem if they can easily recall examples of it. Another contributing factor to these incidents is a phenomenon known as \\"helicopter parenting,\\" a term coined to describe the highly involved and protective behavior some modern parents exhibit. Helicopter parents often hover over their children, providing constant guidance, direction, and support, thereby limiting their opportunities for independent growth and development. This parenting style is thought to have resulted, in part, from an increased focus on child safety and a desire to minimize potential risks, both real and perceived. Encouraging children to be self-sufficient and develop autonomy has numerous benefits, including fostering resilience, problem-solving skills, and a sense of self-reliance. However, these incidents of parental scrutiny have raised questions about how much independence is appropriate and at what age. There is no universal formula or correct answer to this question, as each child's maturity and capabilities differ, and parents must ultimately make these decisions based on their own judgment and understanding of their child's unique needs and abilities. In many cases, the outcome of such investigations largely depends on the specific circumstances and jurisdiction in which they occur. For instance, Maryland's child neglect statutes provide that children under the age of eight should not be left alone within a building, enclosure, or vehicle without proper supervision, while South Carolina's laws do not specify a minimum age for children to be left unsupervised. Ultimately, these incidents have sparked a national conversation about the balance between protecting children and facilitating their growth and development. They force us to question our own assumptions about what constitutes good parenting and whether the fear of potential dangers is causing us to over-correct to the point of inhibiting the natural and essential process of learning and growth. In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, providing children with the tools to navigate their environments safely and independently is of utmost importance, and that sometimes means allowing them to take small, calculated risks under carefully assessed circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation would be directly impacting a step of the process. Justification: 1. A forest fire starts - This step is not directly affected by the fewer deaths of animals in the fire. 2. The fire surrounds the vicinity - This step also doesn't directly involve the animals and their survival. 3. The animals are trapped - Since fewer animals die in the fire, it means some animals can potentially escape the trap or find a way to survive within the trapped region. Thus, this step is directly impacted by the fewer deaths of the animals. 4. Those that survive have their habitat destroyed - This step involves the animals that survived the fire, but the number of survivors is already impacted in the previous step. Therefore, this step is not directly affected. 5. The survivors must find a new habitat - This step is indirectly impacted because more animals surviving the fire might make it more challenging to find a new suitable habitat for them. 6. Conflict with other animals occur - This step is also indirectly impacted by more animals surviving the fire as it might lead to more conflicts due to a higher number of displaced animals. However, this is a result of the change that occurred in a previous step. In conclusion, the perturbation of fewer animals dying in the fire would directly impact the \\"The animals are trapped\\" step of the process, as it requires a change in the way animals respond to the trap or the fire's behavior itself to allow more animals to survive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite their contrasting skills in karate, Kenneth and Eric shared a strong friendship, often found practicing together after school at the local dojo. Kenneth, always brimming with energy and exceptional athleticism, seemed like he was born to practice karate. His high kicks and powerful strikes impressed their sensei and peers alike, making him an admired figure in the dojo. He had a knack for picking up new techniques and refining his form at a pace that left most of his colleagues astounded. On the other hand, Eric struggled with his physical abilities from the beginning. As simultaneously endearing and frustrating his clumsiness was, it often left him lagging behind in their karate sessions, fumbling and tripping over his own feet. Despite his struggles, Eric never allowed his natural clumsiness to deter him from his passion for karate. He maintained a positive attitude, determined to improve and overcome his limitations. His perseverance and heart were truly inspiring, and his love for the martial art was contagious. Noticing that his friend needed help, Kenneth took it upon himself to guide and support Eric in honing his skills. Knowing that there was a strong potential in his friend, he provided him with all the encouragement and assistance he required to excel in karate. Kenneth devised specific training methods tailored to Eric's capabilities, focusing on improving his balance, coordination, and overall agility. During their extra practice sessions, the two would work together for hours, repeating various drills, and correcting each other's mistakes. They shared laughs, tears, sweat, and setbacks; yet, their bond only grew stronger as they became more in sync with each other's movements. Kenneth and Eric were an unstoppable team, a living testament to how friendship could overcome any challenges and bring out the best in one another.

Kenneth and Eric had ultimately found solace and brotherhood through their shared passion for karate. They both realized that it was not simply about becoming the strongest or the fastest; instead, it was the journey of personal growth and the bonds formed along the way that truly defined what it meant to be a martial artist. United by their love for the sport, the two friends continued to inspire each other and those around them, demonstrating that perseverance, determination, and a helping hand could turn even the most naturally clumsy of souls into a skilled and confident karate practitioner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Introduction \\"Preach what you practice,\\" goes the saying. Nowhere does the concept of demonstrating one's love for an art form by engaging with it through performance, creation, and education sit more strongly than in the field of music. But, as some recent events have shown, this ideal can sometimes fail to cross the boundaries created by commercialism and creative control. The Glee vs Kings of Leon Dispute The American musical dramedy television series Glee, created by Ryan Murphy, has garnered an enormous following since its premiere in 2009. Capturing the hearts of audience members by showcasing the struggles and joys of high school life through song and dance, Glee has introduced many teenagers to the world of music in a fun, engaging, and innovative manner. But not everyone shares Glee creator Ryan Murphy's enthusiasm. One notable disenchantment stems from a recent disagreement with the rock band Kings of Leon, who refused to let their music be used on the show. Murphy shared his reaction with the Hollywood Reporter: \\"F*** you, Kings of Leon. They're self-centered a**holes, and they missed the big picture. They missed that a 7-year-old kid can see someone close to their age singing a Kings of Leon song, which will maybe make them want to join a glee club or pick up a musical instrument.\\" Ryan Murphy's message is clear — by denying Glee the rights to use their music, Kings of Leon may inadvertently turn away potential future fans and hinder the importance of arts education among the younger generations. Murphy continues by saying, \\"It's like, OK, hate on arts education. You can make fun of Glee all you want, but at its heart, what we really do is turn kids on to music.\\" Understanding the Band's Standpoint On the other hand, it's crucial not to overlook the band's perspective. Kings of Leon's frontman, Caleb Followill, is confused by the controversy. \\"It's gotten out of hand,\\" he says. \\"At the time of the request, we hadn't even seen the show. ... This was never meant as a slap in the face to Glee or to music education or to fans of the show. We're not sure where the anger is coming from.\\" While it's important to respect artists' control over their creations, Followill's response highlights the possible disconnect between two essential elements in promoting and celebrating art: creators and educators. The feud between the Glee creator and Kings of Leon inadvertently brings to light the question of responsibility: should musicians facilitate and promote arts education by willingly sharing their work to inspire future generations, or should they retain ultimate control over how their art is used and interpreted? A Missed Opportunity for Arts Education As educational budgets face systematic cuts, and arts courses are often the first on the chopping block, it's apparent that creative education needs all the allies it can muster. Ryan Murphy's Glee has stoked a passion for music in countless young people, and the show's inclination for covering popular hits has the potential to build a devoted audience for these artists. Thus, when artists like Kings of Leon deny the use of their music in this type of influential program, it would be remiss not to consider the potential detrimental impact on art education and future artists. Furthermore, a heated exchange between creators and educators may only serve to muddy the waters, instead of fostering an environment of collaboration and understanding for the betterment of creative learning. Conclusion In conclusion, the Glee vs Kings of Leon conflict shines a spotlight on the delicate balance between artistic control and fruition of arts education. While it is essential to respect and protect artists' rights over their creations, it is equally crucial to acknowledge the importance of inspiring future generations to keep the love for music alive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it. Williamson County population : 226,257 Wayne County population : 16,583 I ran a business with my father, graduated from a high school that was ranked 24/273 instead of one ranked of 223/273 in the state. The woman I married would not be the same, nor where I live and the lifestyle I now live, the jobs I have been able to get, the places I have been able to go, traveling around the US and to Canada and soon further abroad. The amazing things that I have experienced in my life are a pretty direct effect of some 16 year old kid not paying attention and rear ending my family. Of course certain decisions were made and things happened that took things down this particular path, but it all leads back to that night. Good night, and drive safely! According to the above context, answer the following question. At the end, how does the girl feel about these episodes?

The resulting changes in her life, including her father's new relationships, the business they ran together, and her own opportunities for traveling and personal growth, can all be traced back to that significant moment.

Driving a car Do not use your phone while you are driving ! You could concentrate on your conversation and forget to look where you are going, or you could take your eyes off the road to look at the phone's display or to press in a number. Either way, you could cause a terrible accident. In a restaurant There is probably nothing more annoying than a diner receiving or making a call near you when you are in a restaurant. The icy glares you receive should be warning enough that it is not appreciated. Turn you phone off and enough that it is not appreciated. Turn you phone off and use your message service to return calls after you leave. At the cinema Do not give way to the desire to call a friend if the film is boring, or if you want to find out what happens. You could become the target of all the angry cinema customers. At the theatre There is no more icy glare than that of a theatre goer who has paid a lot of money to see a show and hears your phone playing a tone. It goes without saying that you will be seen as a socially unacceptable person in this situation. In hospitals This is probably the most important place to make sure your phone is switched off. Your phone can disturb life-saving electronic equipment in hospitals, so it is necessary that your phone is switched off before you enter. On planes Your phone might disturb navigational equipment and cause a horrible accident so you should switch it off before boarding a plane.

He also served as co-executive producer of the WB Network TV series of Baby Blues. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Kirkman work was not recognized by the public before 2012\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not accurate to conclude that Rick Kirkman's work was not recognized by the public before 2012. While he did receive the prestigious Reuben Award in 2012, there are other indications that his work was recognized prior to that year. The paragraph highlights that Rick Kirkman received the National Cartoonist Society Newspaper Comic Strip Award in 1995 for his work on \\"Baby Blues\\". This clearly indicates that his work was acknowledged and appreciated by the public at least as early as 1995. Additionally, the paragraph states that Kirkman served as co-executive producer of the WB Network TV series of Baby Blues. Although a specific time frame is not provided, we can infer that his involvement in the TV series is another indicator that his work had gained recognition even before 2012, as he was trusted with an important role in bringing the comic strip to a new medium. Furthermore, given that \\"Baby Blues\\" was co-created by Kirkman and has been in syndication since it debuted on January 7, 1990, the comic strip's widespread distribution could also be seen as an indication of its success and recognition by the public. In conclusion, it is incorrect to assume that Rick Kirkman's work was not recognized by the public before 2012. Evidence from the paragraph suggests that his work was recognized and appreciated at least as early as 1995, and possibly even earlier, given the debut date and success of the \\"Baby Blues\\" comic strip since its inception."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Relatives of a dying lady I was caring for kicking and screaming not to give their Mum pain relief because they were so terrified / knew it would probably be the thing to end her life. She had a horrible aggressive cancer that ravaged her whole body and needed very regular doses of strong pain relief which - as she had a terminal illness and was receiving end of life care - did not have an upper limit so to speak. She had pain relief as and when needed to make her comfortable and that often results in people ultimately overdosing. Mum had Alzheimer's and was howling and writhing in agony so we were giving her pain relief but daughters knew it would probably result in her death - which they were right about possibly happening and in their grief and panic, started trying to prevent us from doing anything. Didn’t want us getting near her at all and we had to go through an awful scenario of trying to explain what we had to do for Mum and why and when they still wouldn’t have it or allow us near, we had to do what nobody wants and go against their wishes by administering the pain relief anyway. One daughter screamed the place down, threatened to have me arrested and struck off / said she would go to the papers and tell them about how we killed her Mum and in the end she had to be removed from the bedroom. Her Mum was given the pain relief, immediately relaxed and fell asleep then died peacefully in her sleep about 15 mins later. The saddest thing is her daughter wasn’t able to be there and see her Mum dropping off so peacefully and her last memory will forever be of her screaming and thrashing about as she (daughter) was physically removed from the room. Tragic. Question: Why was Mum in agony === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"The mum was in agony because she had an aggressive cancer that had spread throughout her body. This type of cancer can cause severe pain due to the damage and pressure it puts on nerves, organs, and bones. In addition, the mum also had Alzheimer's disease, which could have exacerbated her distress and discomfort. In this situation, end-of-life care focused on providing pain relief and comfort for the dying patient. The strong pain relief medication might have contributed to her death but was essential to ease her suffering and allow her to pass away peacefully. The daughters, in their grief and fear, struggled to accept the inevitability of their mother's death and tried to prevent the administration of pain relief. However, the medical professionals had a responsibility to prioritize the patient's well-being and provide her with the necessary palliative care to alleviate her suffering. It is understandably difficult for family members to accept the loss of a loved one and the process of providing end-of-life care. In this tragic scenario, the daughters were unable to see their mother pass away peacefully due to their reluctance to allow the necessary medical intervention."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Irish traditionally wear something coloured green on this day as the colour is connected with Ireland. Another St Patrick's Day tradition is for the non-Irish to make jokes about the Irish. Usually these jokes will be about Irish stupidity or their famous thirst for alcohol, or their reputation  for telling tall(untrue) stories. These characteristics are all part of the famous Irish stereotype   that Irishman are hot-tempered drinkers, who love to fight and will do anything to avoid a day's work. The real joke, however, is that this negative Irish stereotype still exists. The stereotype might have had some truth back in the 19th century when Irish was poverty-stricken and starving. Many Irish moved to the United States to escape famine , but there they had to compete,  occasionally with their fists, for jobs and housing with other immigrant groups. It was on America's streets that the Irish earned their reputation for street fighting. However, it was far from truth today, with the exception of the drinking perhaps. Today, the Irish are admired for their story telling gifts and musical talents. It is no accident that several of the greatest writers of the 20th century were Irish. Or that many of today's most popular music groups such as singer Enya and rock band U2, are Irish born and growing. Lonely Planet readers even ranked Ireland as the friendliest country in the world. However, one bit of the Irish stereotype is true, their love for drink. Drinking in Ireland is a job, but it's not necessarily something to criticize. It was the Irish after all who created one of the world's best-loved beers, Guinness. Question: Where did the negative Irish stereotype come from?

The man had more pain when he got a vasectomy than when he got a sunburn because the","output":"vasectomy was a surgery and sunburn was just from being out in the sun too much. Let me explain this a bit more, little buddy. A vasectomy is a special doctor's visit where the doctor helps a man so he can't make babies anymore. This involves a small surgery, where the doctor has to make a little cut and fix something inside the man's body. Just like when you accidentally hurt yourself and it stings or aches, a surgery sometimes leaves people feeling sore after it's done. That's why the man felt more pain after the vasectomy. On the other hand, a sunburn is what happens when someone spends too much time playing outside on a sunny day without putting on enough sunscreen or taking breaks in the shade. The sun's rays gently cook their skin, leaving it red, warm, and a bit painful. Imagine you accidentally touched a warm cookie tray, and your finger felt hot and sensitive for a little while. That's like a sunburn, but all over your body! Since the vasectomy was a surgery and involved a doctor fixing something inside the man's body, it made him feel more pain than the sunburn, which happened to the outside of his body and wasn't as serious. So, the man had more pain from the vasectomy than the sunburn because surgeries can sometimes make people feel sore and uncomfortable after they're done."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Everyone is dead; one of them had barricaded himself in the radio room and is still sitting frozen in his chair, his wrists and throat slit in an apparent suicide. Mac and Copper explore further, finding a large and empty block of ice. Outside in the snow, along with one or two burned human bodies, Mac and Copper find the burnt and frozen corpse of a twisted creature, not man but not beast, either. They bring it back to their own base for an autopsy, but that muddies up the mystery.That night, the new stray husky is locked in with the sled dogs.

The name of specific alkanes always ends in - ane . The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points.  Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers studied chemistry in school. Ted studied alkanes, while Ned studied cycloalkanes. They both received grade A.  Answer this question please: Which brother learned more about methane? Answer:","output":"Ted learned more about methane. Step 1: Identify the subjects the brothers studied. Ted studied alkanes, and Ned studied cycloalkanes. Step 2: Determine which subject is more relevant to methane. From the given background information, we know that methane is an alkane, as it is mentioned with other alkanes like ethane. Step 3: Identify which brother studied the subject related to methane. Since Ted studied alkanes and methane is an alkane, Ted would have learned more about methane as part of his studies. Therefore, Ted, who studied alkanes, learned more about methane than Ned, who studied cycloalkanes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Jordan started to feel better after taking some medication for their headache.  Given the question \\"How would you describe Jordan?\\", is \\"felt very relieved\\" a valid answer? Available choices:  (A). Yes;  (B). No; Answer:","output":"Answer: (A). Yes Explanation: The question on how to describe Jordan focuses on their emotional state or conditions in relation to a particular situation. In this scenario, Jordan started to feel better after taking medication for their headache. Therefore, it is reasonable to describe Jordan as \\"felt very relieved\\" because experiencing relief is a natural reaction to an improvement in physical discomfort or pain.  When people experience headaches, they usually find it difficult to concentrate on their tasks, communicate effectively with others, and can also experience irritability. The intensity of headaches can vary; some might be mild or moderate, while others might be so severe that they debilitate the person experiencing them. In Jordan's case, taking medication to alleviate the headache brought relief, indicating that their comfort and well-being were positively impacted by the medication. In answering the question \\"How would you describe Jordan?\\" by saying they \\"felt very relieved,\\" you are highlighting an emotional response resulting from the alleviation of their headache. It reflects a human experience of feeling grateful, satisfied, or more at ease with their physical state after addressing an issue that was causing discomfort. This description captures an aspect of Jordan's emotional condition after taking the medication and offers insight into their experience in the given situation. In conclusion, stating that Jordan \\"felt very relieved\\" is a valid answer when describing them, as it emphasizes their emotional response to an improvement in their physical well-being. It allows the person inquiring to understand how Jordan's condition changed after taking the medication and how that change made an impact on their feelings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Argentine forces, who had landed on the Falklands to stake a territorial claim, were ejected by a British military task force. Argentina says it has a right to the islands, which it calls the Malvinas, because it inherited them from the Spanish crown in the early 1800s. It has also based its claim on the islands' proximity to the South American mainland. Britain rests its case on its long-term administration of the Falklands and on the principle of self-determination for the islanders, who are almost all of British descent. The windswept and almost-treeless territory is made up of two main islands, East Falkland and West Falkland, as well as hundreds of smaller islands and islets.

The islands are self-governing, although foreign affairs and defence matters are handled by the British government. There is no party-political activity on the islands. A new constitution to enhance the powers of the Executive Council came into force on 1 January 2009. Coverage of local affairs is provided by a radio station and by the territory's sole newspaper, Penguin News. Some key dates in the history of the Falklands: 1690 - English captain makes first recorded landing on Falklands. 1764 - First settlement founded on East Falkland by French navigator. 1765 - British settle West Falkland. They are driven off by the Spanish in 1770 but return in 1771, only to withdraw again in 1774. 1820 - Independent Argentina proclaims sovereignty over the Falklands. 1831 - US warship destroys Argentine settlement in reprisal for the arrest of three US vessels hunting seals. 1833 - British force expels remaining Argentine officials from the island and installs a governor. Argentina continually protests against British occupation. 1965 - UN resolution invites Britain and Argentina to discuss ways of finding a peaceful solution to their dispute. 1982 - Argentina invades, prompting Falklands War. 1990 - Argentina and Britain restore diplomatic relations, severed in 1982. 2013 - Islanders vote to remain a British overseas territory. Summary:","output":"The disputed Falkland Islands, claimed by both Argentina and the United Kingdom, continues to face conflict over territorial rights; however, the population remains predominantly British, and the islanders voted to stay a British overseas territory in 2013."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It had a population of 29,616 in 2001, increasing to 39,201 at the 2011 Census. The settlement is of Saxon origin. Hatfield House, the home of the Marquess of Salisbury, is the nucleus of the old town. From the 1930s when de Havilland opened a factory until the 1990s when British Aerospace closed, Hatfield was associated with aircraft design and manufacture, which employed more people than any other industry.  Hatfield was one of the post-war New Towns built around London and has much modernist architecture from the period. The University of Hertfordshire is based there. Hatfield is north of London and is connected to the capital via the A1(M) and direct trains to London King's Cross, Finsbury Park and Moorgate. As a result, the town has seen a recent increase in commuters who work in London moving to the area.  In the Saxon period Hatfield was known as Hetfelle, but by the year 970, when King Edgar gave to the monastery of Ely, it had become known as Haethfeld. Hatfield is mentioned in the Domesday Book as the property of the Abbey of Ely, and unusually, the original census data which compilers of Domesday used still survives, giving us slightly more information than in the final Domesday record.

Avoid letting your dog get familiar with toileting indoors if you'd like it to toilet outside. If you have a place in your yard where you'd like your dog to toilet, bring it to the spot immediately. Before you even go into your house, let it sniff around the yard until your dog urinates or defecates. When your dog does urinate or defecate, give your dog lots of verbal praise and attention so your dog associates going to the bathroom outside with being praised. In order to make your French bulldog a good household member, begin potty training your dog as soon as you get it. If you wait to begin training and let your dog toilet on puppy pads, it will take longer to potty train it and you dog will be confused about where to toilet. You'll need to be very consistent and encouraging when you begin housebreaking your French bulldog. Most dogs will show signs that they need to toilet, so watch your French bulldog to become familiar with your dog's specific signs. You should also be in the habit of frequently giving it  the opportunity to toilet. Signs that your dog needs to toilet include:  Panting Pacing or sniffing around the house Barking Wandering off to a quiet area If you didn't notice your dog's cue to toilet or your dog accidentally goes in the house, thoroughly clean up the mess. You'll need to use a product designed for pet messes or a special pet-urine enzymatic cleaner. This will completely remove the scent of urine so your dog doesn't return to the same spot to toilet later. Don't scold or hit your dog for having an accident. Your dog won't be able to associate the punishment with the action (toileting inside) and your dog will learn not to trust you.","output":"To effectively potty train a French bulldog, be consistent and encouraging, beginning training early, using praise for outdoor toileting, and recognizing the dog's specific signs for needing to toilet while avoiding indoor toileting confusion and not punishing accidents."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who is one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists? , can you please find it?   Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. As one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. Her 2006 self-titled debut album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and spent the most weeks on the chart in the 2000s. The album's third single, \\"Our Song\\", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the success of pop crossover singles \\"Love Story\\" and \\"You Belong with Me\\", Fearless became the best-selling album of 2009 in the US. The album won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest Album of the Year winner. Swift was the sole writer of her 2010 album, Speak Now. It debuted at number one in the United States and the single \\"Mean\\" won two Grammy Awards. Her fourth album, Red (2012), yielded the successful singles \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" and \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\". For her fifth album, the pop-focused 1989 (2014), she received three Grammys, and became the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice. Its singles \\"Shake It Off\\", \\"Blank Space\\", and \\"Bad Blood\\" reached number one in the US, Australia, and Canada. Swift's sixth album, Reputation (2017) and its lead single \\"Look What You Made Me Do\\" topped the UK and US charts; with the former, she became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the US.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? In our Hello World program, we printed out a string for the user to see, but the interactive part of programs is when the user gets to enter input into the program. We will now extend our program to prompt the user for his or her name and then greet the user by his or her name. In Java, we have some built in libraries that we have access to, but we have to import them. One of these libraries is java.util, which contains the Scanner object that we need to get user input. In order to import the Scanner class, we add the following line to the beginning of our code.   import java.util.Scanner;    This tells our program that we want to use the Scanner object which exists in the package java.util. If we wanted to have access to every object in the java.util package, we simply write import java.util.*; at the beginning of our code. Java is an object-oriented programming language, so it represents concepts using objects. The Scanner object is an example of an object that has fields and methods. In order to use the Scanner class, we have to create a new Scanner object that we can populate the fields of and use the methods of. To do this, we write:   Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);     userInputScanner is the name of the Scanner object that we just instantiated. Note that the name is written in camel case; this is the convention for naming variables in Java. We use the new operator to create a new instance of an object. So, in this instance, we created a new instance of the Scanner object by writing new Scanner(System.in). The Scanner object takes in a parameter that tells the object what to scan. In this case, we put in System.in as a parameter. System.in tells the program to scan the input from the system, which is the input that the user will type into the program. We have to prompt the user for an input so that the user knows when to type something into the console. This can be accomplished with a System.out.print or a System.out.println.   System.out.print(\\"What's your name? \\"); The Scanner will always be taking in data on what the user is typing in. The following line will ask the Scanner to take what the user has typed in for his or her name and store it in a variable:   String userInputName = userInputScanner.nextLine();    In Java, the convention for using an object's method is objectName.methodName(parameters). In userInputScanner.nextLine(), we are calling our Scanner object by the name we just gave it and then we are calling its method nextLine() which does not take in any parameters. Note that we are storing the next line in another object: the String object. We have named our String object userInputName Now that we have the user's name stored, we can print out a greeting to the user. Remember the System.out.println(\\"Hello World.\\"); that we wrote in the main class? All of the code that we just wrote should go above that line. Now we can modify that line to say:   System.out.println(\\"Hello \\" + userInputName + \\"!\\");    The way we chained up \\"Hello \\", the user's name, and \\"!\\" by writing \\"Hello \\" + userInputName + \\"!\\" is called String concatenation. What's happening here is that we have three strings: \\"Hello \\", userInputName, and \\"!\\". Strings in Java are immutable, which means that they cannot be changed. So when we are concatenating these three strings, we are essentially created a new string that contains the greeting. Then we take this new string and feed it as a parameter to System.out.println. Our code should now look like this:   import java.util.Scanner;  public class HelloWorld {     public static void main(String[] args) {         Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);         System.out.print(\\"What's your name? \\");         String userInputName = userInputScanner.nextLine();         System.out.println(\\"Hello \\" + userInputName + \\"!\\");     } } Go into command prompt or terminal and run the same commands as we ran for our first iteration of HelloWorld.java. We have to first compile the program: javac HelloWorld.java. Then we can run it: java HelloWorld.","output":"This article teaches how to create a Java program that asks for a user's name and then greets them using the Scanner object from the java.util library, with step-by-step instructions and explanations on how the code works."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The two groups have clashed several times in the last few years. The Batwa killed several members of the Luba ethnic group near the region of Kabalo in Katanga. The Luba then launched a revenge attack, killing at least 13 pygmies.

After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc.

Sentence: Angola International Airport serves Luanda and its runway is 4000 long. What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"From the given sentence, several pieces of information can be extracted that contribute to our understanding of the Angola International Airport and its characteristics. Here is a detailed breakdown of the data points mentioned in the sentence: 1. Name of the airport: The sentence informs us that the airport in question is called Angola International Airport. 2. Location served: Angola International Airport serves the city of Luanda. Luanda is the capital and largest city of Angola, a country in southwestern Africa. This information establishes a connection between the airport and the city, indicating the airport's significance in facilitating transportation and connectivity for Luanda. 3. Presence of a runway: The sentence mentions a \\"runway,\\" which is an essential aspect of any airport. Runways are paved and flat surfaces that allow airplanes to take off and land. This detail highlights the primary function of Angola International Airport in enabling air travel. 4. Length of the runway: The runway at Angola International Airport is stated to be 4,000 long. However, it is crucial to understand the units of measurement used for stating this length, as runways are typically measured in feet or meters. Assuming meters, the Angola International Airport runway is 4,000 meters (or approximately 13,123 feet) long. In general, a runway of this length would be sufficient to support large commercial aircraft and potentially heavy cargo planes. The length of the runway thus gives us some insight into the size and potential capacity of the Angola International Airport. 5.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened tariffs on an additional 100 billion worth of Chinese goods, on top of the 50 billion in import taxes he already has proposed against Beijing. Though none of the tariffs have taken effect, it's the latest posturing in a trade dispute that some fear could escalate into a trade war. For decades, Trump has complained about China's trade practices. One of his main complaints is what he calls Beijing's theft of U.S. intellectual property. Last month, Trump cited IP theft as justification for his proposed tariffs on 50 billion in Chinese goods. China retaliated by threatening its own tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. Trump then escalated the dispute, saying he would consider tripling the amount of goods to which tariffs would be applied. China gains access to U.S. technology by employing several tactics, which many observers have said are unfair or illegal. Beijing has long required that U.S. businesses transfer technology to Chinese companies as a precondition of entering the Chinese market. For instance, if you are a U.S. carmaker who wants to sell automobiles to China, Beijing requires that you team up with a local Chinese company, or face steep tariffs on imported vehicles.  In other cases, China requires U.S. companies to comply with localization requirements by storing sensitive data in the Chinese mainland. That increases the risk of intellectual property theft through means such as cyberattacks.It's difficult to quantify the value of technological knowledge. But according to an estimate last month by the U.S. trade representative, Chinese theft of American intellectual property costs between 225 billion and 600 billion every year. That rate is unsustainable, said top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. \\"We can't afford to give up our technology,\\" Kudlow said Friday. \\"When they steal our technology ... they're stealing the guts of our American future.\\" The Chinese government has always denied carrying out the cyberattacks that frequently...

Question: You are given a new situation: Over the years, the town of Euphoria has grown more successful and wealthier than anyone ever thought. As the wealth has increased and people have acquired more material possessions, their outlook on life has become more positive and it has been noted that the citizens have a lower incidence of depression. The town of Zenphora, on the other hand, has taken a downward financial turn over the past 50 years. The citizens have had to sell their worldly goods just to make ends meet and many do not have a good feeling about what their future holds.  and a hint : Using longitudinal data from over 100 countries, Diener and his colleagues showed that rich countries are in general happier than poor countries (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013).[17] Also, life satisfaction for most countries goes up as they become wealthier over time. Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity.  Please answer this question : Which town is more optimistic, Euphoria or Zenphora? Answer:","output":"Based on the given situation and the research mentioned, it can be concluded that the town of Euphoria is more optimistic compared to Zenphora. There are several reasons that support this conclusion. Firstly, Euphoria has experienced a significant increase in overall wealth and success, leading to a higher quality of life for its citizens. This growth in material wealth has resulted in a more positive outlook among the population, which correlates with the findings of Diener, Tay, and Oishi (2013)[17]. According to their study, people from richer countries exhibit higher levels of happiness compared to those from poorer countries. Therefore, the residents of Euphoria are more likely to have a higher subjective well-being (SWB), which can contribute to their optimism. Secondly, as the town's wealth has increased, its citizens have acquired more material possessions, leading to greater household material prosperity. This factor, as identified by Diener, is directly linked to the relationship between income and SWB. The high material prosperity of Euphoria's citizens would also contribute to their higher levels of optimism. Furthermore, the lower incidence of depression reported among Euphoria's citizens implies a healthier mental state for the overall population. This mental well-being is likely to have a positive impact on the town's overall outlook and optimism. On the other hand, Zenphora has experienced a downward financial turn over the years, leading to its citizens selling their worldly goods just to make ends meet. This decline in economic conditions and material wealth lowers the financial satisfaction of Zenphora's residents, another factor influencing SWB as identified by Diener. The uncertainty about the future felt by Zenphora's citizens further contributes to the lesser optimism in their town. This lack of security and confidence in the future can impact the residents' mental well-being, making them less hopeful and optimistic compared to the citizens of Euphoria. In conclusion, based on the research conducted by Diener and his colleagues, as well as the context provided, the town of Euphoria is more optimistic than Zenphora due to the substantial difference in their economic conditions, material wealth, financial satisfaction, and overall mental well-being of their populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In dieser Übersetzung geht es um den Prozess der Verdauung, bei dem Nahrung in ihre Bestandteile zerlegt wird, um eine effektive Aufnahme dieser durch den Körper zu gewährleisten. Dieser Prozess ist wichtig, da die zugeführte Nahrung in einer Form vorliegt, die vom Körper nicht direkt aufgenommen werden kann. Aus diesem Grund muss die Nahrung zunächst in ihre Bestandteile aufgespalten werden, damit diese vom Darmwand absorbierbar sind. Die Zerlegung der Nahrung beginnt bereits im Mund, wo Speichel und Zähne durch Kauen die Nahrung zerkleinern und mit Verdauungsenzymen vermengen. Anschließend gelangt die zerkleinerte Nahrung in den Magen, der weitere Enzyme und Magensäure zur Verfügung stellt, um die Nahrung aufzuspalten. Im Laufe dieses Prozesses werden die komplexen Makromoleküle der Nahrung in kleinere Bestandteile, wie Aminosäuren, Monosaccharide und Fettsäuren, aufgebrochen.  Nach der Aufspaltung der Nahrung durch Magen und Dünndarm erreichen die zerkleinerten Nährstoffe den Dünndarm, der für die Aufnahme der meisten Nährstoffe verantwortlich ist. Dort verbinden sich die Nährstoffe mit Transportproteinen und werden durch die Dünndarmwand in den Blutkreislauf oder das Lymphsystem aufgenommen. Durch die Absorption der Bestandteile im Darm ist es dem Körper möglich, diese zur Energiegewinnung, Zellreparatur und -aufbau, oder für andere lebenswichtige Prozesse zu verwenden. Der Dünndarm ist mit zahlreichen Fingerfortsätzen, sogenannten Villi und Mikrovilli, ausgestattet, die die Oberfläche der Dünndarmwand erhöhen und dadurch eine effizientere Aufnahme der Nahrungsbestandteile ermöglichen. Nachdem die Nährstoffe in den Blutkreislauf und das Lymphsystem aufgenommen wurden, gelangen sie in die verschiedenen Organe und Zellen des Körpers, um dort ihre jeweilige Funktion zu erfüllen. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass der Abbau von Nahrung in ihre Bestandteile notwendig ist, damit der Körper diese durch den Darm aufnehmen kann. Dieser Prozess ermöglicht es dem Körper, die zugeführte Nahrung effektiv und gezielt zu verwerten und für verschiedene lebenswichtige Funktionen zu nutzen."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Abbey Road is the eleventh album by English rock band the Beatles, released on 26 September 1969 by Apple Records. The recording sessions for the album were the last in which all four Beatles participated. Although Let It Be was the final album that the Beatles completed before the band's dissolution in April 1970, most of the album had been recorded before the Abbey Road sessions began. A double A-side single from the album, \\"Something\\"/\\"Come The front cover design, a photograph of the group on a zebra crossing, was based on ideas sketched by McCartney, and taken on 8 August 1969 outside EMI Studios in Abbey Road. At 11:35 that morning, photographer Iain Macmillan was given only ten minutes to take the photo whilst he stood on a step-ladder and a policeman held up traffic behind the camera. Macmillan took six photographs, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before deciding which of the shots would be used upon the album sleeve.  In the image selected by McCartney, the group walk across the street in single file from left to right, with Lennon leading, followed by Starr, McCartney, and Harrison. McCartney is barefoot and out of step with the other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for PS2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911 - 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.  Shortly after the album's release the cover became part of the \\"Paul is dead\\" rumour that was spreading across college campuses in the United States. According to followers of the rumour, the cover depicted the Beatles walking out of a cemetery in a funeral procession. The procession was led by Lennon, dressed in white, as a religious figure, Starr, dressed in black, as the undertaker, McCartney, out of step with the others, as a barefoot corpse and Harrison, dressed in denim, as the gravedigger. The left-handed McCartney is holding a cigarette in his right hand, said to indicate an imposter and the license plate on the Volkswagen parked on the street is 28IF, meaning McCartney would have been 28 if he had lived. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Why was that rumor spreading","output":"There was a rumor spreading that Paul McCartney from the Beatles had passed away because of the way the Abbey Road album cover looked. In the picture, the Beatles were walking like they were in a funeral procession. People thought that John was a religious figure, Ringo was an undertaker, Paul was a barefoot corpse (also holding a cigarette with the wrong hand), and George was a gravedigger. So, some people believed that the cover was secretly telling everyone that Paul was no longer alive. But it was just a rumor, and not true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: A Streetcar Named Desire Movie plot: Under mysterious circumstances, Blanche DuBois, an aging high school teacher, leaves her home in Auriol, Mississippi to travel to New Orleans to live with her sister, Stella Kowalski. She arrives on the train and boards a streetcar named \\"Desire\\" and reaches her sister's home in the French Quarter where she discovers that her sister and brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski, live in a cramped and dilapidated two-room apartment in an old New Orleans tenement. Blanche and Stella are all that remain of an old aristocratic family. Blanche discloses that the family estate, Belle Reve, has been lost to creditors, and that she wants to stay with Stella and Stanley for a while. Blanche seems lost and broke, with nowhere to go. Stella welcomes her with an open heart. From the start, Blanche and Stanley are wary of each other. Blanche has a soft-spoken manner; Stanley is rough and loud. His mere presence seems to threaten her, while her behavior and manner arouse suspicion in him. She is especially adroit at patronizing and criticizing Stella from the start. When interrogated about her past, struggling to be polite, Blanche says that she was married and widowed at a young age. She says that she has taken a leave of absence from her job due to her nerves. To satisfy Stanley's skepticism about the loss of the estate, Blanche hands over her papers pertaining to Belle Reve. But Stanley grabs at some of her private papers that she is holding back, and they cascade to the floor. Weeping, she gathers them all back, saying that they are poems from her dead husband. He defends himself by saying that he was just looking out for his family, and then announces that Stella is going to have a baby. Soon after her arrival, Stanley has a poker night with his friends where Blanche meets Mitch. His courteous manner sets him apart from Stanley's other friends. They like each other right away. This is the start of their romance. Stanley explodes in a drunken rage, striking Stella, and sending his friends running, while Blanche and Stella flee... The answer to this question is:","output":"Stella goes to the hospital primarily because she is giving birth to her baby. In the movie \\"A Streetcar Named Desire,\\" Stella Kowalski becomes pregnant during the course of the story. The plot revolves around the tense relationship between Stella's sister, Blanche DuBois, and her husband, Stanley Kowalski. As their conflicting personalities and backgrounds create drama, tension rises in the household. While the primary reason for Stella's hospital visit is childbirth, it is also important to note that the escalating tension between Blanche and Stanley could have had an impact on Stella's well-being. The stress caused by her sister's arrival and the constant bickering with Stanley may have contributed to Stella feeling overwhelmed and possibly experiencing some pregnancy complications that would require medical attention. As Stella goes to the hospital, this event marks a significant turning point in the movie, as it leaves Blanche and Stanley alone in the apartment. This unfortunate circumstance sets the stage for further unsettling events and ultimately culminates in a dramatic showdown between the two characters. In conclusion, Stella goes to the hospital to give birth to her baby, and this event, coupled with the existing tension between Blanche and Stanley, plays a crucial role in the development of the movie's plot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They both polluted the environment in different ways.  and a hint : In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.  Please answer this question : Which county contributed less to acid rain formation? Answer:","output":"Plant county contributed less to acid rain formation than Thorn county. The primary reason behind this difference lies in the source of energy each county utilized for their energy needs. Thorn county relied on fossil fuels, while Plant county used nuclear power. Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, produce a significant amount of harmful emissions when burned for electricity generation. These emissions include sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter, which are major contributors to the formation of acid rain. Acid rain is formed when these pollutants react with water vapor in the atmosphere, creating acidic compounds that fall to the ground as rain, snow, or mist. Acid rain has detrimental effects on ecosystems, including soil and water degradation, damage to aquatic life, and harm to both crops and vegetation. In contrast, nuclear power generation does not produce the same level of emissions associated with the burning of fossil fuels. Nuclear reactors produce electricity through nuclear fission, a process in which energy is generated by splitting the nuclei of heavy atoms, such as uranium or plutonium. This process does not emit sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or particulate matter, making it a significantly cleaner source of electricity in terms of air pollution and contribution to acid rain formation. While it is true that nuclear energy has its own set of environmental concerns, such as the handling and disposal of radioactive waste, these issues primarily pertain to the risk of radioactive contamination rather than contributing to acid rain formation and air pollution. Furthermore, although radioactive elements are also nonrenewable resources, the time scale of their depletion is much longer than that of fossil fuels, which are being consumed at an exponential rate. Based on the provided information, Plant county's reliance on nuclear power for their energy needs resulted in a smaller contribution to the formation of acid rain compared to Thorn county, which used fossil fuels as their primary energy source. This difference illustrates the importance of considering alternative energy sources and implementing cleaner energy production methods to mitigate the environmental impacts associated with electricity generation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.  Paragraph: Two groups of teens studied fire for the physics class.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer: What religious group places a great importance on wearing the turban?","output":"The religious group that places great importance on wearing the turban is the Sikhs, followers of Sikhism. Sikhism is a monotheistic religion founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan. Today, Sikhism is the fifth largest religion globally, with over 25 million followers worldwide. The turban, known as \\"Dastaar\\" or \\"Pagri\\" in Punjabi, holds significant spiritual, historical, and cultural importance for Sikhs. One of the reasons why turban wearing is considered crucial in Sikhism is the concept of maintaining uncut hair, known as \\"Kesh,\\" which is one of the Five Ks (\\"Panj Kakaar\\"). The Five Ks are essential articles of faith that all baptized Sikhs, also known as Khalsa, are instructed to wear by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. Aside from Kesh, the other four Ks include Kara (steel bracelet), Kanga (small wooden comb), Kachera (cotton undergarments), and Kirpan (ceremonial sword). The turban serves multiple purposes, as it helps protect and manage the uncut hair while ensuring cleanliness and promoting a unique identity. It is important to note that both Sikh men and women may wear turbans, although it is more common among men than women. Historically, the turban played a vital role in asserting social and political equality during the time of Mughal rule in India. At that time, wearing a turban was a privilege reserved for the high-ranking officials and elites. By encouraging his followers to wear turbans, Guru Nanak aimed to break down social barriers, emphasizing that all are equal in the eyes of God. Furthermore, the turban has cultural significance for Sikhs, as it symbolizes self-respect, honor, and spirituality. It acts as a constant reminder of the wearer's commitment to the teachings of Sikhism and their dedication to upholding its tenets. Wearing the turban also instills a sense of unity among Sikhs, creating an easily recognizable identity that fosters social cohesion and camaraderie. In conclusion, the Sikh religious group places great importance on wearing the turban as an embodiment of their faith, history, and culture.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who observes the girl running from the taxi driver?  Just-married taxi driver Thomas Leslie 'Tom' Manning is led to an abandoned bomb-site by an eight-year-old girl who says that she has lost her dog. The kind-hearted Manning gives her his handkerchief to dry her tears. She then runs off taunting Manning as an April-fool prank. He stumbles and raises a fist at her – and this is witnessed by Mrs Zunz. The girl is later found murdered on the bomb site, strangled as she sang 'Oranges and Lemons' while feeding the ducks. Manning is picked up by Scotland Yard for questioning and is later arrested and charged with murder, with circumstantial evidence including his handkerchief (found under the body of the girl), a fibre from his coat under the dead girl's fingernail and the testimony of Mrs Zunz. A wartime pilot who suffered a head-wound, even Manning himself started to doubt his mind, and wondered if he had suffered from a \\"blackout\\"?Manning's wife, Jill, convinced he is innocent, contacts lawyers, but the defending barrister refuses to see her and her imprisoned husband, because he wants to preserve an \\"objective view\\" on the case. She later wins the sympathy of the junior counsel Peter Tanner, who visits Manning in prison, believes in his protestation of innocence and makes the case his own. The trial begins at London's Old Bailey, where Tanner is opposed by his father, prosecuting counsel Geoffrey Tanner. The trial is presided over by Justice Harrington, whose wife is in the hospital undergoing a serious operation. It soon becomes evident that things are going badly for Manning. Jurors are seen expressing their belief in Manning's guilt even before the trial was over. Irene's mother gave hearsay evidence that Manning had given the victim sweets, breaking down in tears and accusing Manning of murder. Following the testimony of prosecution-witness Horace Clifford, all of the evidence seems to point to Manning's guilt. Answer:","output":"The girl running from the taxi driver, Thomas Leslie 'Tom' Manning, is observed by Mrs Zunz."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.  \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been...

According to John Ford's lyrically shot, fictional biopic of Abraham Lincoln's life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in \\"the worst way.\\" Ford's camera has only praising views to reveal of Mr. Lincoln's early life. But for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision. Uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film, what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames, Ford has a unique eye for telling a story. The film sings of the life of a hopeful young man. Henry Fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever Lincoln to a tee, one of his best roles. The film concerns two young men, brothers, on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed. In classic angry mob style, the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them, until honest Abe steps into the fray. He charms them with his humor, telling them not to rob him of his first big case, and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys lawyer. What follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom- murder-dramas thereafter, as Abe cunningly interrogates witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge, jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing links. The film plays out like many John Ford movies do: a tablespoon of Americana, a dash of moderate predictability, a hint of sarcasm that you aren't sure if you put in the recipe or if Ford did it himself. Despite the overtly 'Hollywood' feel of the film, and overly patriotic banter alluding to Lincoln's future presidency, the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed, if you can take your drama with a grain of salt.

The Dano-Hanseatic War from 1426-1435  was an armed trade conflict between the Danish dominated Kalmar Union  and the German Hanseatic League  led by the Free City of Lübeck. When Danish king Eric opened the Baltic trade routes for Dutch ships and introduced a new toll for all foreign ships passing the Øresund , six Hanseatic cities  declared war, put a naval blockade on Scandinavian harbours and allied with Eric's enemy Henry IV, count of Holstein. Therefore the war was intensively linked with the Dutch-Hanseatic War , the Kalmar War with Holstein  and the Swedish revolt . After years of changing fortune in warfare Rostock and Stralsund signed a separate peace agreement in 1430. Lübeck, Hamburg, Wismar and Lüneburg, however, continued the war and assisted Holstein to conquer Flensburg in 1431. Thereafter they agreed an armistice in 1432 and started peace negotiations. Meanwhile an anti-Danish revolt broke out in Sweden . In 1434 Eric had to agree an armistice with the Swedes, too. In April 1435 he signed the peace of Vordingborg with the Hanseatic League and Holstein, followed by the peace of Stockholm with Sweden a few months later the same year. The Hanseatic cities were excepted from the Sound Dues but they had to accept Dutch competition in the Baltic trade. The Danish Duchy of Schleswig was ceded to the count of Holstein. Sweden's autonomous rights and privileges were extended. These peace agreements weakened Eric's position dramatically, and in 1439 he got dethroned by Danish, Swedish and Norwegian Privy Councils.

Q:What was the official name of the event that launched the careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Discovery Expedition of 1901–04, known officially as the British National Antarctic Expedition, was the first official British exploration of the Antarctic regions since James Clark Ross's voyage sixty years earlier. Organized on a large scale under a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), the new expedition carried out scientific research and geographical exploration in what was then largely an untouched continent. It launched the Antarctic careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, including Robert Falcon Scott who led the expedition, Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, Tom Crean and William Lashly. Its scientific results covered extensive ground in biology, zoology, geology, meteorology and magnetism.  The expedition discovered the existence of the only snow-free Antarctic valleys, which contain Antarctica's longest river. Further achievements included the discoveries of the Cape Crozier emperor penguin colony, King Edward VII Land, and the Polar Plateau (via the western mountains route) on which the South Pole is located. The expedition tried to reach the South Pole travelling as far as the Farthest South mark at a reported 82°17′S.

So, let's move the 33 to the other side of the equal sign. To do that, we can subtract 33 from both sides: 0 - 33 = -33 * s -33 = -33 * s Now, we want to find out how many times the -33 goes into -33 to get s.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"\\"In a startup corporation, is there any reason NOT to issue all authorized (but undistributed) shares as 'treasury stock'?\\" Imagine you have a toy store and you make some toy shares as a way to share the ownership of the store with your friends. Now, instead of giving all the toy shares to your friends right away, you keep some in a special box called 'treasury stock.' There could be some reasons not to issue all the shares as treasury stock right away. One reason is that you might want to invite more friends to own part of the store later, so you keep some toy shares in the box for them. Another reason is that you might want to sell more shares to your friends later, to get more candy (money) to buy more toys for the store. \\"Why was the majority of Bose Corporation's stock given to MIT?\\" Bose Corporation is like a big toy store that makes super cool and high-quality speakers (toys that make sound). The man who started the company, Amar Bose, was a really smart guy and he liked a special school called MIT, where he learned a lot of cool things. Amar Bose decided to give most of his own toy shares of the company to MIT because he was thankful for all the things he had learned there. This special gift helps MIT to keep teaching other smart people to create cool and helpful inventions in the future. \\"Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?\\" No, these questions are not paraphrases of each other. Paraphrase means that two sentences say the same thing but use different words. These questions are different because one is asking about a specific way of sharing ownership in a startup corporation (a new toy store), while the other is asking about a special gift Amar Bose gave to MIT."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a \\"negative\\" movie review (OPTIONS:  -negative.  -positive.).","output":"Title: A Tremendous Misfire - A Dissection of 'Disappointment Express' Over the years, we have eagerly anticipated many cinematic masterpieces, only to have our high hopes shattered by mediocre storytelling and sloppy filmmaking. The latest victim of this epidemic was none other than the much-hyped film, Disappointment Express. With an all-star cast, an experienced director at the helm, and a concept that seemingly promised an intriguing story, it's disheartening to witness the rise and fall of what could have been a marvelous cinematic gem. To begin, the script was a convoluted mess. The story was teeming with confusing subplots, redundant twists and turns, and an overall lack of coherence. While attempting to craft an intricate narrative, the writers inadvertently created an unfathomable knot of tangled storylines, with characters disappearing only to return later with no explanation or relevance to the story. For a protagonist-driven plot, Disappointment Express lost all semblances of stability and reason to invest in the lead character's journey. Moreover, the extensive run time of nearly three hours did no favors for the film. As if the torturous tale wasn't enough, the dragging pace had audiences checking their watches and daydreaming about what could have been an engaging story. The unnecessarily prolonged scenes and redundant dialogue managed only to bore the viewer further into a downward spiral of disappointment. The all-star cast was perhaps the film's biggest betrayal. With a talented lineup comprising A-list actors and fan-favorite performers, one would expect electrifying chemistry and memorable performances. Instead, the stellar group of actors appeared to be stranded in a sea of mediocrity, offering inconsistent and painfully unconvincing portrayals of their characters. The film failed to capitalize on the massive talent pool at its disposal, leaving us with underdeveloped and bland characters who were far from memorable. The director, who has previously showcased his mastery over the art of cinema, seemed to have massively misfired with Disappointment Express. His negligence in handling the story, characters, and pacing clearly manifested throughout the entire film. It was hard to believe that the mind behind some of the industry's most captivating films had produced this barely watchable feature. If there was any redeeming factor in this train wreck, perhaps it was the breathtaking visuals and cinematography. The stunning landscape shots and meticulously crafted set pieces were, unfortunately, the only saving grace amid this cinematic disaster. However, even these qualities could not salvage the unsalvageable, ultimately failing to breathe life into a floundering endeavor. In conclusion, Disappointment Express was a glaring example of wasted potential with a disjointed script, bland characters, and seasoned professionals who failed to leave a lasting impression. It's a shame that such a promising premise succumbed to poor storytelling and direction. Thus, the ultimate legacy of Disappointment Express will be yet another lesson in the art of squandered opportunities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

This person is 23 years old but is often mistaken for someone much younger, such as a 12-year-old or 18-year-old. As a result, when they consume alcohol, particularly in social situations like their mom's work party, the people around them may feel concerned or worried about their actions. After taking a beer to drink, the following may happen: 1. Disapproving or concerned looks: The people around the person might give them worried or disapproving looks, thinking they are underage and should not be consuming alcohol. This reaction could be based on their mistaken belief that the person is a minor. 2. People might question their age: In some situations, people might confront the person and ask for their age to ensure they are legally allowed to drink alcohol. These questions could make the person feel uncomfortable and singled out. 3. People may feel uneasy or uncomfortable: Some people at the event might feel uneasy or awkward about the perceived underage person consuming alcohol. This could cause unnecessary tension in the social gathering. 4. The person may be asked to show ID: In some cases, the person might be asked to present identification to prove their age. This can be an embarrassing and frustrating experience, as it reinforces the misperception that the person is not of legal drinking age. 5. Social isolation: The person might feel socially isolated due to the reactions of others around them, as they are treated differently due to their youthful appearance. This could lead to a sense of loneliness or frustration as a result of the misunderstandings about their age. 6. Loss of self-esteem: Continuously being mistaken for someone younger than they are can negatively impact the person's self-esteem, making them doubt themselves and feel disrespected or undervalued. In conclusion, when a person who appears younger than their actual age takes a beer to drink, they may experience worried looks, questioning, unease, and possibly even be asked to show ID. This can lead to feelings of social isolation and a loss of self-esteem as they struggle with being misjudged based on their appearance. The person should consider openly expressing their age or finding ways to appear more mature to reduce the likelihood of these situations occurring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lady Sarah's husband is murdered shortly before she arrives, and the authorities tell her that the killer is an Aboriginal elder, \\"King George\\". Meanwhile, cattle station manager Neil Fletcher is trying to gain control of Faraway Downs, so that Lesley 'King' Carney will have a complete cattle monopoly, giving him negotiating leverage with an Australian army officer, Captain Dutton, who wants to buy the cattle. The childless Lady Sarah is captivated by the boy Nullah, who has an Aboriginal mother and a white father. Nullah tells her that he has seen her cattle being driven onto Carney's land â in other words, stolen from her. Because of this Fletcher mistreats Nullah and threatens him and his mother, so Lady Sarah fires Fletcher and decides to try to run the cattle station herself. When Nullah and his mother hide from the authorities in a water tower, his mother drowns. Lady Sarah comforts Nullah by singing the song \\"Over the Rainbow\\" from the film The Wizard of Oz. Nullah tells her that \\"King George\\" is his grandfather, and that like the Wizard, he too is a \\"magic man\\". Lady Sarah persuades Drover to take the cattle to Darwin for sale. Drover is friendly with the Aborigines, and therefore shunned by many of the other whites in the territory. It is revealed that he was married to an Aboriginal woman, who died after being refused medical treatment in a hospital because of her race. Lady Sarah also reveals she is unable to have children.

You can also pick up this fungus from the floor of a public shower or other damp areas. After acne, athlete’s foot is the most common skin disease in the United States.

The U.S. State Department on Friday ramped up its warnings urging  Americans not to join other activists in a flotilla, expected to sail  soon, aimed at  challenging Israel's maritime  blockage of the Gaza  strip. According to  organizers, the flotilla is meant  to commemorate the  one-year anniversary of a similar flotilla that  resulted in a clash in  international waters with Israeli  navy  commandos that left nine people  -- including an American citizen --  dead. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters  Friday that she didn't think the plan \\"is useful or productive or  helpful to the people of Gaza.\\" \\"We have certainly  encouraged that  American citizens not participate in the flotilla,\\" she  said, \\"and we are urging  that all precautions be taken to avoid any  kind of  confrontation.\\" Clinton's comments followed  an even harsher  statement by State Department spokesperson Victoria  Nuland, in which she criticized what she called \\"irresponsible and  provocative actions that risk the safety of their passengers.\\" Last May, the Mavi Marmara -- owned by the Turkish  Humanitarian Relief Foundation, or IHH -- and five other ships were on  their way to Gaza, carrying humanitarian aid and about 700 activists  from various countries, when Israeli soldiers swarmed aboard it. Despite  international condemnation, an independent Israeli commission, led by  retired judge Yaakov Turkel, later found that Israeli commandos \\"acted  professionally and in a measured manner in the face of unanticipated  violence\\" when they seized the Gaza-bound aid ship. In  September, the U.N. Human Rights Council found Israeli forces \\"committed  serious violations of international law\\" in the raid and suggested that  six of the civilian deaths were \\"consistent with ... an arbitrary and  summary execution.\\" Israel called the report \\"as biased and as one-sided as the body that has produced it.\\" The  U.S. State Department earlier this week issued a travel warning advisting U.S.  citizens \\"against traveling to Gaza by any means, including via  sea.\\" \\"Previous  attempts  to enter Gaza by sea have been stopped by Israeli  naval  vessels and resulted in the injury, death, arrest, and deportation of   U.S. citizens,\\" the State Department statement said. \\"U.S. citizens  participating in any effort to  reach Gaza by  sea should understand  that they may face arrest, prosecution, and deportation by  the  government of Israel.\\" Ali Abunimah, a blogger for  the Electronic Intifada and supporter of the protest, accused  Clinton  of seeming  to \\"lay the ground -- indeed almost provide a green light --  for an Israeli  military attack on the upcoming Gaza Freedom   Flotilla.\\" Activists say the blockade is illegal and has worked to undermine Gaza's  already fledgling economy. Israel has promised to block any attempt to  break a blockade that they say is important in keeping weapons from  being delivered to Gaza. The protesters said they raised funds to   purchase a U.S.-flagged vessel, which they named \\"The Audacity of Hope,\\"  a  reference to the best-selling book of the same title by President  Barack Obama. The boat, they claim, will carry 36  passengers, four crew members, and ten journalists. The  protesters say  they want to \\"challenge U.S. foreign policy\\" by providing aid and   supplies directly to the citizens of Gaza, in  spite of Israel's   blockade. \\"We encourage all Americans to support our  voyage, and to agitate with the US government and public opinion to  ensure our safe passage to Gaza,\\" wrote Robert Naiman, policy director  at the advocacy group Just Foreign Policy, who said he'll be part of the  flotilla. The State Department  counters that, if the  activists want to help the citizens of Gaza, there is a better -- and  legal -- way  to do it. Victoria  Nuland, the  department's spokeswoman, told reporters,  \\"We've got to use the  channels that are safe, the  channels that are  going to guarantee that  the aid get where it needs to go to  the people  it's intended for.\\" Clinton  added Thursday that it would be unwise to move toward Israeli waters  and create \\"a situation in which the  Israelis have the right to defend  themselves.\\" But these words did not impress Abunimah,  who wrote that \\"in light of Clinton's statements, if any  blood is  spilled it will not only be on Israeli, but also  American hands.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1. The U.S. State Department has warned Americans not to join an activist flotilla intending to challenge Israel's maritime blockage of the Gaza strip, commemorating a previous flotilla's one-year anniversary where a clash with Israeli navy commandos resulted in nine deaths. 2. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described the flotilla plan as unhelpful and unproductive, urging American citizens not to participate and for precautions to be taken to avoid confrontation. 3. Last year's Mavi Marmara incident, where Israeli soldiers seized a Gaza-bound aid ship, led to international condemnation, but an independent Israeli commission found that the commandos \\"acted professionally and in a measured manner.\\" 4. The U.N. Human Rights Council accused Israel of committing \\"serious violations of international law\\" in the raid, while Israel called the report biased and one-sided. 5. The U.S. State Department issued a travel warning against traveling to Gaza by sea, highlighting potential injury, arrest, deportation, and prosecution by the Israeli government. 6. Activists argue that the blockade is illegal and undermines Gaza's economy, while Israel maintains the blockade is important to prevent weapon deliveries to Gaza. 7. Protesters plan to send a U.S.-flagged vessel named \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" carrying passengers, crew, and journalists to directly provide aid to Gaza's citizens. 8. The State Department recommends using legal channels to provide aid to Gaza, but some activists accuse Hillary Clinton of providing a green light for a potential Israeli military attack on the activist flotilla."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Offices are small and mostly plain, except for the eclectic mix of pop art, African statuary and neon that adorns litigation director Webb Brewer's space. Brewer, who has been at the agency 20 years, said there is a need for lawyers of all stripes to help with the problems of the poor. \\"The private bar could meet more of the need through pro bono work, but there are still cases that involve the systemic problems for low-income people that we would need to do,\\" said Brewer. \\"The legal system marketplace just doesn't serve low-income people too well, except in fee-generat-ing type cases,\\" Brewer said. \\"If a poor person gets run over by a bus, an attorney might take that case because they might be able to recover part of the damage award as attorney fees. But so many of the cases we handle have to do with basic rights and a decent life. There is just no profit motive.\\" Larry Pivnick, law professor at the University of Memphis Law School and director of political programs at MALS, said Legal Services is a great learning laboratory for law students. \\"There are thousands and thousands of people who have problems that never get an opportunity to appear in court,\\" Pivnick said. \\"Some people may not be particularly articulate. Courts have rules that clients don't always understand.\\" Brewer said a major focus of the agency's work involves housing. \\"Although a lot of our work is grant-driven, we find that the lack of safe and decent affordable housing and the prevalence of predatory lending are the biggest problems in our client population,\\" Brewer said, referring to clients such as James.

Here's a breakdown of the potential outcomes: 1. Medium: This answer does not provide any clear information about the effects of eating spicy food, as \\"medium\\" could refer to the level of spiciness in the food or could simply be an unrelated term. 2. Illness: Consuming spicy food, especially if you are not used to it, might cause some discomfort or mild gastrointestinal issues, but it is unlikely to directly cause serious illness. However, if the spicy food is contaminated or if you have a specific allergy or intolerance to an ingredient, it could potentially lead to illness. 3. Throwing up: For some individuals, consuming extremely spicy food may cause nausea and vomiting due to irritation of the gastrointestinal tract. This reaction is more likely if the person eating the spicy food is not accustomed to spicy dishes or has a sensitivity to certain spicy ingredients. 4. Heartburn: This answer is the most accurate outcome of consuming spicy food for a majority of people. Heartburn is a burning sensation in the chest, often due to acid reflux. Eating spicy foods can trigger or worsen heartburn for some individuals because capsaicin, the active compound in chili peppers responsible for the spicy sensation, can cause the lower esophageal sphincter to relax, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus and leading to heartburn. 5. Sleepiness: Eating spicy food does not typically cause sleepiness. It might have an opposite effect, as the stimulation from the spicy sensation could temporarily increase alertness. However, if you eat a large, high-calorie meal that includes spicy foods, it may lead to temporary sleepiness due to general post-meal fatigue. In conclusion, eating spicy food can lead to a range of reactions, but among the options presented, heartburn is the most plausible and commonly experienced reaction for many individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But as always, there are other subplots to watch, too. Here's a rundown of what the pundits are saying: Based on dozens of polls, Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight projection system gives Romney a whopping 97% chance of victory, predicting that he'll win around 44% of the vote, to Newt Gingrich's 29.3%. That's close to the final Florida poll from PPP, which has Romney winning 39% to 31%. Indeed, Romney has a sizeable lead already. At least 15% of Florida Republicans voted in advance, the Washington Post reports, and one poll suggests Romney won that round 55% to 24%. Romney's victory would be especially significant because Florida is so diverse, the Wall Street Journal adds; a win would indicate that he is indeed the candidate best poised to beat Obama. Politico will be watching a few key demographics with interest. Will Gingrich's marital shenanigans hurt him with women, as they didn't in South Carolina? And will Romney win over Hispanics, as he didn't in 2008? (Polls indicate that he will.) Gingrich's totals in the Panhandle and northeast will be interesting as well—those are the regions most similar to South Carolina. And then there's Rick Santorum. He devoted no resources to Florida, but if his total is too low, expect calls for him to drop out to intensify. The apparent inevitability of Romney's victory already has some candidates shifting focus to Nevada—which means that whatever happens, this rodeo ain't over. Expand this summary.","output":"Voters in Florida are casting their ballots today, and many polls indicate that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has a strong chance of emerging victorious. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight projection system, based on multiple polls, gives Romney an impressive 97% chance of victory, predicting he will win around 44% of the vote while Newt Gingrich receives 29.3%. This is consistent with the final Florida poll from PPP, which has Romney leading 39% to 31%. Romney's sizeable lead is further demonstrated by early voting statistics, with at least 15% of Florida Republicans having already cast their votes. According to a poll, Romney took 55% of the early ballots compared to Gingrich's 24%. Romney's success in Florida is particularly significant because of the diversity of the state, which, according to the Wall Street Journal, suggests he is the candidate best poised to challenge President Obama. Political analysts will be keeping an eye on certain demographics in the contest: Gingrich's marital history, for instance, failed to affect his performance in South Carolina, but it remains to be seen whether this will have an impact on his relationship with female voters in Florida. Similarly, it will be crucial for Romney to secure support from Hispanic voters, which he failed to do in 2008. Both Gingrich's totals in the northeastern Panhandle and Romney's performance among Hispanic voters will help determine the outcome. Also under observation is Rick Santorum, who chose not to invest resources in the Florida race. If his final vote count is too low, there may be increased pressure for him to withdraw from the contest. With many candidates already turning their attention to Nevada, it is clear that the race for the Republican nomination is far from over, regardless of the outcome in Florida."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences have: - the same number of aircraft (58), - a similar term to describe the aircraft (liaison and connecting), and - the same information regarding their usage (20 of them were used for messengers). Step 3: Determine if the change in wording alters the overall meaning. The replacement of \\"liaison\\" with \\"connecting\\" does not change the overall meaning. Both terms imply a function that connects people or places through communication. Additionally, the phrasing of the aircraft usage (being for messengers) remains consistent with a minor reordering of words.

At first,the local people on the island were very kind to the European visitors,giving them allthe food and clothes they needed to survive.However,as the months passed,the local people became more and more unhappy with their guests,who were tricking and stealing from them.Finally the locals decided to stop helping.Without food or any way to leave the island,Columbus's group was soon in serious trouble. Luckily for Columbus,he had a book about the stars and planets on his ship.It described the movements of all the objects in the night sky.The book,written by a well-known German scientist,said there would be a total lunar eclipse on the evening of February 29,1504 and how long it would last. Columbus worked out the difference in time between Germ any and North America.He then had a meeting with the local leaders just before the eclipse would take place.In this meeting,Columbus told them his god was angry because the local people were no longer giving food.So his god would take away the moon to punish them.The moment Columbus finished talking,just as he had planned,the moon began disappearing. The local leaders grew frightened and quickly agreed to provide Columbus with food and anything else he wanted.But first,Columbus's god had to return the moon.Columbus told them he would have to discuss the idea with his god on his ship.Knowing the moon would stay completely hidden for about 48 minutes,Columbus returned just before the moon began to reappear.From that day on,until they finally left,Columbus and his men no longer had any trouble getting the food they needed.

Article: Find someone interesting you know and ask them to be the subject of your reality show. You could also find a group of people or a business in your town to focus on. Avoid pitching a show that’s about celebrities or exotic, far off places; you probably won’t have access to them when you’re just starting out. Up front you’ll need to decide how your show will be structured. There are two main structures for reality shows:   Self-contained. Self-contained reality shows contain episodes that stand on their own. There’s no storyline that connects all of the episodes together. Viewers can watch the episodes out of order and it won’t make a difference. Think: Extreme Home Makeover, Fear Factor, and Hoarders. Self-contained shows are generally easier to sell because networks like that viewers can join in at any time in the season.   Arced. Arced reality shows have an overarching storyline that connects every episode. Viewers need to watch the episodes in order to understand what’s going on. Examples of arced reality shows are The Real World, Survivor, and The Bachelorette. Arced reality shows are harder to sell to networks because they're riskier; if audiences don't tune in for episode one, the rest of the season could be a bust. Format style reality shows have a similar format they return to each episode. Dancing with the Stars is an example of a format reality show; every episode features the dancers performing a new routine. The audience expects that tuning in. A format reality show is a good choice if your show will feature different characters or storylines each episode. If your reality show is about parents moving into their kid's college dorm for a week, you could have a different family in each episode. The parents moving into the dorm each episode would be the format people would come to expect. Docu-style reality shows don't have a format; they just follow the main characters around as they go about their lives. Keeping Up with the Kardashians is an example of a docu-style reality show. A docu-style reality show is a good option if the premise of your show is examining an interesting person or group of people as they navigate their world. If you're making a show about a retired pilot, filming like a documentary will be easier than trying to come up with a format for your character to repeat every episode.

Movie title: Django Unchained Movie plot: In 1858, Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave, is chained to a bunch of other slaves and being marched to his new owner's estate in Texas by the Speck brothers. At nightfall, a German man in a dentist cart pulls up and hails the Speck brothers. He introduces himself as Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz).Schultz is clearly more intelligent and enlightened than the Specks. He says he is looking for a slave who can identify a band of wanted fugitives known as the Brittle brothers. Django announces that he knows the Brittle brothers and can identify them. Schultz offers to buy Django, but his polite and educated manner rubs the ill-mannered Specks the wrong way, and Ace Speck threatens to shoot him with his shotgun. In response, Schultz lowers his lantern, whips out a revolver, and shoots Ace, then Dicky's horse, causing Dicky to fall off his horse. The horse carcass then lands on and crushes Dicky's leg, leaving him screaming in pain. Crippled, he agrees to sell Django, and Schultz pays the man (for both Django, and the dead Speck's horse), gets an official title to Django, and prepares to ride off.Before Schultz leaves, however, he frees the remaining slaves (clearly, Schultz finds slavery abhorrent) and says that they may either carry the remaining Speck brother back to town, or shoot him and flee. As Django and Schultz ride off, we hear Speck pleading for his life. We hear a gunshot and can see blood splatter as Dicky's brains are blown out.Django and Schultz arrive in the small town of Daughtrey near El Paso. As they travel through the streets, townspeople stop to stare in disbelief at the sight of a nigger on a horse, much to Schultz's confusion. As Schultz ties his cart down at a hitching post, he checks some papers to make sure he's in the right place.

The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new. I think my husband and I embarrass our daughter now practically no matter what we do just because we’re parents and maybe because we’re older in our 60’s and too happy to see her and too eager to please and we inadvertently treat our daughter like she is still a kid although she will be 22.

Answer:","output":"The feelings and reactions of others surrounding Casey and his relationship with the girl he truly loves may vary depending on various factors such as their relationship to Casey, their own personal beliefs, and experiences. Here's a detailed exploration of how different people might feel in relation to Casey's situation. 1. Friends of Casey: Casey's friends are likely to feel happy for him if they see that he is genuinely in love and that his relationship is a positive and healthy one. They may feel content that he has found someone who makes him happy and try to be supportive. However, there could be certain friends who might feel jealous or left out, particularly if they are single or unhappy in their own relationships. This could result in them feeling resentment or even attempting to negatively influence Casey's relationship. 2. Family Members of Casey: Casey's family may have mixed feelings, depending on each individual's perspective. For instance, his parents might feel happy and supportive if they believe the girl he is dating is kind and well-suited for him. On the other hand, they could feel worried or apprehensive if they have concerns about the girl's character, background, or their compatibility with Casey. His siblings might feel a sense of joy, protectiveness, or even jealousy depending on their own experiences and relationships. 3. Friends of the Girl: The girl's friends could also have diverse reactions to the relationship. If they see that their friend is happy and well-treated by Casey, then they would likely feel happy for her and supportive of the relationship. Nevertheless, similar to Casey's friends, they might experience feelings of jealousy, exclusion, or negative emotions if they perceive their relationship as being threatened or affected by the new romance. 4. Family Members of the Girl: Much like Casey's family, the girl's family members could also have varied reactions. If they believe that Casey is a good partner for their family member, they would likely feel pleased, welcoming, and supportive. However, they might feel apprehensive or concerned if they have doubts about Casey or the future of the relationship. Cultural and personal beliefs may also play a role in shaping their feelings. 5. Ex-partners or Crushes of Both Parties: Ex-partners or people who might have had interest or history with either Casey or the girl could feel a range of emotions from sadness and disappointment to jealousy, bitterness, or anger. The intensity of these feelings might differ based on how much time has passed since their past relationships and their current emotional state. 6. Acquaintances and The Broader Community: While acquaintances and the broader community might not have a strong emotional response to Casey's relationship, their feelings would mostly depend on their own experiences, beliefs, and values. Generally, they might feel happy for the couple but could be indifferent or mildly curious. In rare cases, some individuals might express negativity if they harbor pre-existing biases against either person or their relationship dynamic. In conclusion, the feelings of others surrounding Casey and his relationship with the girl he loves would depend on a multitude of factors. The most crucial element to consider is the genuine happiness and well-being of Casey and his partner. As long as the couple maintains a healthy, respectful, and loving relationship, the opinions and feelings of others should ultimately not impact the success of their love story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Text: Sleep deprivation is the second most common trigger of seizures. In some cases, it has been responsible for the only seizure a person ever suffers. However, the reason for which sleep deprivation can trigger a seizure is unknown. One possible thought is that the amount of sleep one gets affects the amount of electrical activity in one's brain. Question: can lack of sleep cause seizures in adults?","output":"Yes, lack of sleep or sleep deprivation can potentially cause seizures in adults. Sleep deprivation is considered to be the second most common trigger of seizures and, in some cases, has even been responsible for the only seizure a person experiences. Although the exact reason for sleep deprivation leading to seizures is unknown, there are several hypotheses and potential mechanisms that can help explain this occurrence. Seizures are the result of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, and sleep plays a critical role in regulating the brain's normal electrical activity. Insufficient sleep can disturb the balance of electrical activity, making the brain more susceptible to seizures. Below are some possible explanations for the link between sleep deprivation and seizures: 1. Effect on brain chemicals: Sleep plays an essential role in maintaining the balance of neurotransmitters – chemicals that transmit signals between nerve cells. Sleep deprivation may interrupt this balance, leading to reduced inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and increased excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate. An imbalance in these chemicals could cause excitability in the brain, increasing the risk of seizures. 2. Altered brain activity: Sleep is vital for the normal functioning of the brain, enabling essential processes like memory consolidation, information processing, and cognitive function. To function correctly, the brain undergoes regular cycles of electrical activity during sleep. Sleep deprivation may disrupt these cycles and alter brain activities, potentially increasing the chances of a seizure. 3. Increased stress and fatigue: Sleep deprivation can lead to increased levels of stress, anxiety, and fatigue, all of which can impact the brain's electrical activity. These factors can lower the seizure threshold – the level of stimulation required to trigger a seizure – making an individual more vulnerable to seizures. 4. Aggravation of pre-existing conditions: Sleep deprivation can worsen symptoms or trigger seizures in individuals with pre-existing conditions like epilepsy. Sleep disturbances are common in people with epilepsy, and inadequate sleep can make seizure control more challenging. 5. Circadian rhythm disruption: The body's internal clock, known as the circadian rhythm, regulates various physiological processes, including the sleep-wake cycle. Disruptions in this cycle due to sleep deprivation can affect the brain's electrical activity. Factors like changes in melatonin production, body temperature regulation, and hormone levels may contribute to the relationship between sleep deprivation and seizure risk. It is essential to emphasize that while sleep deprivation can increase the risk of seizures in adults, these risks differ among individuals. Some people may be more susceptible to sleep deprivation-induced seizures due to genetic factors or pre-existing medical conditions. Maintaining good sleep hygiene and ensuring adequate sleep on a regular basis can help lower the risk of sleep-deprivation-related seizures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Greg studied Biology, and his younger cousin Dawn decided to study chemistry. They both graduated Summa Cum Laudae.  But I can use this background: Chemists look at the world in two ways, often simultaneously. The two worlds of the chemist are the macroscopic world and the microscopic world. Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain.

Context: British colonial rule in the region of modern-day Malawi, where the revolt occurred, began between 1899 and 1900, when the British sought to increase their formal control over the territory to preempt encroachment by German or Portuguese colonial empires. The region became a British protectorate in 1891  and in 1907, was named Nyasaland. Unlike many other parts of Africa, where British rule was dependent on the support of local factions, in Nyasaland British control rested on military superiority. During the 1890s the colonial authorities put down numerous rebellions by the local Yao, Ngoni and Cewa peoples. British rule in Nyasaland radically altered the local indigenous power structures. The early colonial period saw some immigration and settlement by white colonists, who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs, often for token payments in beads or guns. Most of the land acquired, particularly in the Shire Highlands, was converted into white-owned plantations where tea, coffee, cotton and tobacco were grown. The enforcement of colonial institutions, such as the Hut Tax, compelled many indigenous people to find paid work and the demand for labour created by the plantations, led to their becoming a major employer. Once employed on the plantations, black workers found that they were frequently beaten and subject to racial discrimination. Increasingly, the plantations were also forced to rely on a system of forced labour or corvée, known locally at the thangata. Question: How many years after the region became a British protectorate in 1891, was it named Nyasaland? Answer:","output":"The region became a British protectorate in 1891 and was named Nyasaland in 1907. To find out how many years passed between these two dates, subtract 1891 from 1907. 1907 - 1891 = 16 Therefore, it was named Nyasaland 16 years after it became a British protectorate."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

These layers are: 1. Troposphere - This is the layer closest to the ground, where all the weather happens. 2. Stratosphere - This is where airplanes fly and where a special thing called the ozone layer lives. It protects us from the sun's strong rays. 3. Mesosphere - This layer is higher up and colder. When shooting stars fall from space, they burn up here. 4. Thermosphere - This layer is very hot, and the air up here is very thin. This is where the Northern and Southern Lights happen. 5. Exosphere - This is the last layer before space, and is the thinnest layer. Only a few air particles float up here. Second question: The innermost layer of the atmosphere is the troposphere.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€. It’s a nice cool 14°C (57°F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

Local white vigilantes tie Wylie to a truck and drag his body through town, for all the community to see, before hanging him from a tree. The sheriff's widow, Edna Spalding, is left to raise her children alone and maintain the family farm. The bank has a note on the farm and money is scarce; the price for cotton is plummeting and many farms are going under. The local banker, Mr. Denby, pays her a visit. He begins to pressure her to sell the farm as he doesn't see how she can afford to make the loan payments on her own let alone run the farm. A drifter and handyman, a black man by the name of Moses, appears at her door one night, asking for work. He offers to plant cotton on all her acres and cites his experience. Edna declines to hire him but offers him a meal instead and sends him on his way. In desperation, Moses steals some of her silver spoons before he leaves.

When the police capture Moseswith her stolen silver, and bring him back to confirm the theft, Edna seizes the opportunity. She lies to the police and says he is her hired man.

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft).  Now, I have a new situation: Pam and Alice studied Earth's climate and vegetation. Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S).  Answer this question please: Which person studied less about the Andes of South America? A:","output":"The person who studied less about the Andes of South America is Pam.  Here's the reasoning:  The Andes of South America is mentioned in the background as an area where large regions of alpine tundra occur. Alpine tundra is consistently mentioned in context of high altitude environments on mountains.  Regarding latitude, the background information mentions that between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres. This underscores the presence of alpine environments such as the Andes within these latitudes. Considering these pieces of information, it's reasonable to deduce that the Andes of South America falls within the lower latitudes range of 30°N to 20°S. Since Alice studied these lower latitudes, she would have studied more about the Andes than Pam, who focused her studies on the higher latitudes of 70 to 50°N.

Given the question: Information:  - The Inclosure Acts (or \\"Enclosure Acts\\" in modern spelling) was a series of United Kingdom Acts of Parliament which enclosed open fields and common land in the country, creating legal property rights to land that was previously considered common. Between 1604 and 1914, over 5,200 individual Enclosure Acts were put into place, enclosing .  - Common land is land owned collectively by a number of persons, or by one person, but over which other people have certain traditional rights, such as to allow their livestock to graze upon it, to collect firewood, or to cut turf for fuel.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England.  - Enclosure (sometimes inclosure) was the legal process in England during the 18th century of enclosing a number of small landholdings to create one larger farm. Once enclosed, use of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be common land for communal use. In England and Wales the term is also used for the process that ended the ancient system of arable farming in open fields. Under enclosure, such land is fenced (\\"enclosed\\") and \\"deeded\\" or \\"entitled\\" to one or more owners.

A judge described a teenage rape victim as ‘extremely foolish’ and ‘unwise’ for getting very drunk as he jailed the two men who attacked her. Craig Whitelaw and Kristofer McLaren, both 21, raped the 18-year-old student in an alley after leading her from a nearby nightclub in an ‘inebriated’ condition. Earlier the young woman had been seen ‘stumbling’ around and ‘throwing herself’ at men inside the club, Teesside Crown Court was told. Jailed: Craig Whitelaw, left, and Kristofer McLaren, right, both 21, are beginning nine-year jail sentences for 'a rape of the most squalid kind' after they attacked a woman they had just met on the dancefloor of a nightclub. After her 50-minute ordeal the victim was dishevelled, distressed and covered in blood, with cuts and bruises to her back. Jailing both men for nine years, Mr Justice Males said that the victim was ‘extremely foolish,’ commenting: ‘She became so drunk that she was vulnerable and defenceless to your exploitation.’ But he also told the defendants: ‘There should be no doubt what you did was still rape, and rape of the most squalid kind. ‘Your victim was very unwise to allow herself to drink so much that she became so thoroughly inebriated. But it was you, and only you, who deliberately took advantage of her condition ... to see what fun you could have with her. 'It's just lasses attention-seeking': What Whitelaw, pictured arriving at court for an earlier hearing, said of the victim after he was arrested by police. ‘It was you who decided to treat her body as a plaything on which to act out your sordid fantasies of having a threesome.’ The case comes at a time of huge controversy over the rape laws and the issue – which featured in the conviction of footballer Ched Evans – of a victim being too drunk to consent. The court heard the woman kissed McLaren and Whitelaw, and CCTV showed them ‘leading her outside’ within 15 minutes of meeting her at Club Amadeus in Northallerton, North Yorkshire. Paul Newcombe, prosecuting, told the jury the men saw her as ‘an easy target’ and ignored her pleas that she wanted to go back to her friends as they went outside. The pair bragged to a taxi driver about the ‘threesome’ as they left the scene last August and exchanged jokey texts about what they had done. One described the incident as ‘funny as ****’. Abattoir worker Whitelaw admitted downing more than a dozen pints of lager as well as a vodka and cola. McLaren told police that he had had seven pints. The victim was later found to have blood alcohol levels that were double the legal driving limit. The jury convicted each man of a charge of rape, and Whitelaw of a count of sexual assault. They were cleared of another rape offence. When Whitelaw was arrested, he admitted having sex, but claimed it was consensual, and said: ‘It’s just lasses attention-seeking.’ McLaren, a former sales worker who had been due to study law at university, later admitted having intercourse. He initially told police: ‘I saw what went on, but I had no part in it.’ After the case Katie Russell from Rape Crisis said the judge’s comments about the victim being extremely foolish were ‘unhelpful’. But she added: ‘The judge makes it clear that 100 per cent of responsibility for this crime is down to these two men.’ Inebriated: Whitelaw and McLaren had been drinking for most of the day before going to Club Amadeus, pictured, a popular dance venue in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, where they met their victim. Clare Phillipson, of Wearside Women In Need which supports victims of sexual and domestic violence, said: ‘The only person responsible for rape is the rapist.’ This week research by the Office for National Statistics showed that more than a quarter of the public believe victims of rape or sex attacks are at least ‘a little bit responsible’ if they were drunk. Among 16 to 19-year-olds the proportion rises to one in three. Last month the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must ‘challenge’ the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been ‘drinking.’ The number of recorded sexual offences is at a 10-year high, official figures show. In the year to March 2014 there were a total of 64,205 sex crime incidents across England and Wales, an increase of a fifth on the previous year. Within that, the number of rapes increased 26 per cent to 20,745 incidents, while the number of other sexual offences increased 17 per cent fo 43,460 incidents. The Office for National Statistics said the increases may in part be because victims are more willing to come forward after the high-profile prosecutions of public figures such as Rolf Harris and Fred Talbot. 'While some of these increases will be a direct consequence of the historical crimes reported as part of Operation Yewtree, there is evidence to suggest that there has been a wider \\"Yewtree effect\\",' the ONS said in a statement. 'This refers to an increased willingness on the part of victims of sexual offences that are not directly connected to Yewtree to come forward to report both historical and recent sexual offences.'

Options: A: carried silk,tea and other goods to England B: could reach many parts of the world by sea C: could sail along the Thames River D: surprised Londoners with an unusual boat The answer is:","output":"B: could reach many parts of the world by sea. The article discusses a Chinese sailing boat from Fuzhou that arrived in London after traveling around the Cape of Good Hope and up the western coast of Africa, covering a distance of fifteen thousand miles. The journey demonstrated the Chinese people's ability to build good boats and sail them well. The author's main goal is to prove that the Chinese could sail to distant countries in the world, showing their maritime capabilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The focus is on identifying other sources of influence on mosaic art in these regions. Step 2: Evaluating the proposed answer The suggested answer states that \\"In Syria and Egypt the Arabs were influenced by the great tradition of Roman and Early Christian mosaic art.\\" Step 3: Identifying key information in the proposed answer The proposed answer highlights two influences on mosaic art in Syria and Egypt: the tradition of Roman mosaic art and the tradition of Early Christian mosaic art. Step 4: Comparing the proposed answer to the actual question The question asks for information about other influences on mosaic art besides early Christians. While the proposed answer does mention the influence of Roman mosaic art (which is a valid response to the question), it also emphasizes the influence of early Christians, which is not relevant to the question. Step 5: Justifying the conclusion The proposed answer, while providing some relevant information, does not fully address the question's requirements due to the inclusion of early Christian influences. Therefore, it might be better to rephrase the answer, eliminating the reference to early Christians and focusing only on the Roman influence: Revised Answer: \\"In Syria and Egypt, the mosaic work was influenced by the great tradition of Roman mosaic art, among others.\\" By focusing on the Roman influence without mentioning early Christians, the new answer more directly addresses the question."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the company that markets pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring?  People have used resources on and around the Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971.  William R. Muehlberger was one of the geology instructors.Exploratory drilling for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971. The wells did not show promising results, so the effort was abandoned.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What were the last names of the four people that led the march and formed a breakaway group?  Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released  the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. On 29 October 2017, the Tyne Bridge was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival. The event, promoted by Newcastle University re-enacted many world civil rights stories throughout history. The final event, revolved around the March, the re-enactment was described as a memorable closing to the finale.

Summarize the following: Use the same soap each time you wash your hands. Your hedgehog will begin to associate that scent with you and be more comfortable. Do not wear gloves when you handle your hedgehog. Your hedgehog will not be able to smell you.  Hedgehogs may also be frightened by the smell of gloves and begin to bite. If you do not want to use your bare hands, use a blanket instead. If you do use a blanket, use the same one each time and wash it with the same detergent.

This is completely normal.  Do not handle your hedgehog right after you eat, touch something with a strong smell, or handle another animal. Your hedgehog will not know that it's you and may bite you or huff and ball up. Wash your hands thoroughly to get rid of the smell. Your hedgehog may be shy and take a long time to unroll. You can let him relax under a blanket until he unrolls, or you can let him rest on your lap. Your hedgehog will learn that your lap is a safe, comfortable place to sleep and relax.  Always be gentle when you are holding your hedgehog. Being too rough or impatient can damage the relationship you are trying to build. Feel free to watch TV or use your computer while your hedgehog rests in your lap. Always pet your hedgehog in the direction the quills lie. Petting in the opposite direction will be uncomfortable for both you and your hedgehog. When your hedgehog is relaxed, his quills will lie evenly.

Answer the following question: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it.

In test A he used two liquid reactants evenly dispersed, but in test B he used one liquid reactant and one solid reactant. He was surprised to see that two tests had very different results.  But I can use this background: Many reactions take place in solution or in the gas phase, where the reactants are evenly dispersed throughout a homogeneous mixture. However, for reactions in which one of the reactants is a pure solid or liquid (meaning that this reactant is not already mixed together with any other reactants), reactivity only occurs at the surface, where particles of the solid or liquid reactant come into contact with particles of the other reactants. All of the molecules or ions in the interior of the pure substance will not be colliding with the other necessary reactants, so they are not really contributing to the overall rate of the reaction. However, increasing the surface area will increase the frequency of potentially reactive collisions, because more reactant particles will be in contact with the other necessary reactants.  What is an answer for this question: In which test more reactant particles would be in contact with other reactants, test A or test B? Answer:","output":"In test A, more reactant particles would be in contact with other reactants.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who is decided to not be an enemy of the Amazons?  In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battled Ares, the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home.

Please write a short summary for the following article: An exclusive peek inside The Dubai Mall Part of complete coverage on updated 9:21 PM EST, Wed March 5, 2014 (CNN) -- It may seem stunning that one of the most visited tourist attractions on the planet is a mall. Attracting 75 million visitors a year, The Dubai Mall gets more foot traffic than the Eiffel Tower, Niagara Falls and Disney World combined. Of course, The Dubai Mall is no ordinary shopping center. Billed as the world's largest (in terms of total floor space) by the Guinness World Records when it first opened in 2008, the mall is larger than 50 football pitches. It houses 1,200 stores, an Olympic-sized ice skating rink, an aquarium, the world's largest shoe store, 14,000 parking spaces, and a Boeing 737 flight simulator. It was no small investment; the entire complex cost 20 billion to build. \\"It's a city within a city,\\" admits Mohamed Alabbar, chairman of Emaar, the development company responsible for building the mall. It's a city within a cityMohamed Alabbar, Emaar As one can imagine, running such an enterprise is challenging, and it takes a lot of man power. With 20,000 employees, the mall's staff is equivalent to the size of a small army. \\"To make it work, you need to have a tremendous amount of people that are on the job 24 hours a day,\\" says David Macadam, CEO of the Middle East Council of Shopping Centers. Though the mall closes at 10pm (midnight on the weekends), in some ways it is busiest after hours, when a cleaning crew of 100 sweep, vacuum and polish over 1.5m square feet of space every night. \\"It's a huge mall,\\" notes Ahmen Hussein, the night shift supervisor for cleaning. \\"We have to finish before the opening hour. Sometimes we only have five or six hours to do it. It's hard, but we like the challenge.\\" An even more arduous cleaning task sits just outside the malls doorstep. The Burj Khalifa Lake -- an 150m liter artificial body of water that also houses The Dubai Fountain -- requires daily maintenance, partly because the desert climate itches to contaminate it with sand. \\"The job is to target the areas where we have the highest sand accumulation, and clean it in a systematic way,\\" says Jean Hanna, director of operations for The Dubai Fountain. In addition to the human staff, there are underwater robotic vacuums employed to undertake the task. Despite the manpower that goes in to running the mall, Alabbar concedes that even more can be done to ensure it lives up to its full potential: \\"We've tried really hard to make sure it's prestigious, respected, looks after people, customers, companies, shareholders -- the whole thing. I think we're getting there. We still have to work a little bit, but we're getting there.\\" Watch: Bollywood dreams in Dubai's labor camps Watch: Dune bashing: The UAE's extreme motorsport Read: When the elevators don't work in the world's tallest building Summary:","output":"The Dubai Mall, one of the most visited tourist attractions on the planet, attracts 75 million visitors a year, more than the Eiffel Tower, Niagara Falls, and Disney World combined.
