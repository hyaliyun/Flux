Found this joint only because of Yelp -- so thanks, guys!  Took my neighbor and her 13 yr old and my mother...we were prepared to get down and dirty...  Our first impression was that on a Friday night, this place should have been much busier -- it almost made us nervous -- but we soldiered on.     The four of us ordered 3 pounds of shrimp, a pound of crawfish and a half pound of sausage -- all with mild \\"hot n juicy\\" (which is all of their sauces combined).  Word to the wise, I was sort of bummed about ordering it mild, but we had a \\"tendertongue\\" with us... Maybe I'm out of fire breathing practice because we thought the mild - like others on yelp - was definitely hot enough.  First you have to peel the saucy shrimp or crawfish while it's hot out of the steamer -- but then you realize once things cool down to the touch that your tongue is still on fire.     We ordered rolls -- and that was the fun part -- sopping up all the great sauce (since they don't use newspapers on the tables, this is possible...)  We thought the shrimp was definitely better than the crawfish.  They were out of dungeness and blue crabs tonight -- altho had snow crab but we were worried about the texture -- and honestly the shrimp were really good.  The 13 year old is a shrimp-oholic...We ended up ordering another pound for him and the cajun fries for us...really good crispy fries, too.  We girls all had beers -- perfect with the shrimp -- but honestly, once you start eating, you have to keep going -- because you're so slimed, you really can't stop and drink...I'd say we easily went through a roll of paper towels.  And they cleared us up before our 2nd round of shrimp and gave us a new plastic tablecloth and fresh drinks.    Service was genuine -- a little flakey and not really clued into the real reason they were out of crab -- but...does that really matter?    Beware, it's very easy to miss if you're heading from the Strip westbound -- fortunately it's on the right hand side if you're heading west on Spring Mt before you reach Decatur.  Then the easiest way to get back to Henderson is to take Decatur back to the 215 -- another warning -- they're doing some crazy roadwork on Decatur headed south -- so be careful -- the road is badly marked, dark and nuts...  We'll definitely go back -- but this is not for the faint of heart, anyone who doesn't like to eat with their hands or has an aversion to plastic.    Our total bill came to 70 and change before tip.  but we had 4 pounds of shrimp (16 - 20s), 1/2 pound of sausage, 1 pound of crawfish, about a dozen rolls, 1 pc of corn and 1 potato, cajun fries, 5 beers and used up more wetnaps than I'm sure any table has ever before...so we thought it was completely fair.  (Naturally, we stopped at Sheridan's frozen custard on the way home...)  Fun Friday! How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","output":"This review can be described as having a predominantly positive sentiment. The reviewer enjoyed the experience at the restaurant and appreciated the taste and quality of the food, particularly the shrimp. They also found the service genuine and the overall experience fun to share with their family. However, there were minor negative aspects, such as the mild sauce being hotter than expected, the restaurant not being as busy as they thought it would be on a Friday night, and the absence of certain crab options. The reviewer also mentioned some difficulty in finding the place and navigating nearby roadwork.

If you are, have you already started preparing for your trip? Online, there are a large number of preparation tips available for summer travelers. While preparation advice and tips may be of assistance to you, they are often hard to go by. This is because not everyone spends vacations at the same location. No matter what your vacation destination is, you will need to take the climate into consideration. If you are visiting a tropical location, you will need to bring along the appropriate clothing. While you may be expecting warm and sunny weather, it is still advised that you prepare for the worst. Raincoats and an umbrella may be a great addition to your summer clothing. Perhaps, the most popular summer vacation destination is the beach. Each year millions of individuals and families flock to beaches. When vacationing at the beach, it is important that you bring along proper clothing and sunscreen. Many vacationers do not realize the dangers of sunbathing without sunscreen. In addition to sunscreen, you will need to make sure that you have beach towels and plenty of water on hand. For the most part, if you forget to bring along certain supplies you can purchase replacements. Many popular vacation destinations have inflated prices. To prevent unnecessary expenses, you are encouraged to check your luggage before you leave. In addition to the above mentioned preparation tips, you must inform friends and family of where you are going. In case something happens back home, you can easily be reached.

The Wiggles are an Australian children's music group formed in Sydney, New South Wales, in 1991. Since 2013, the group members are Anthony Field, Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce, and Emma Watkins.  The original members were Field, Phillip Wilcher, Murray Cook, Greg Page, and Jeff Fatt. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Page, Cook, and Fatt retired, and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce, and Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects. Field and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band The Cockroaches in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at Macquarie University, where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of children's music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album, and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time.  The group augmented their act with animal characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog, as well as the character Captain Feathersword, played by Paul Paddick since 1993.  They travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The group's DVDs, CDs, and television programs have been produced independently since their inception.  Their high point came in the early 2000s, after they broke into the American market. The group was formally consolidated in 2005.  They were listed at the top of Business Review Weekly's top-earning Australian entertainers four years in a row, and earned A45 million in 2009.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Best Quarterbacks For The Buck Sometimes there’s just no substitute for experience. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Jon Kitna began his pro football career in Europe after a college career at middling Central Washington University left him undrafted by the NFL in 1995. He caught on in the NFL two years later when the Seattle Seahawks signed him as a free agent, the onset of a long career that saw him hold starting jobs on and off in Seattle, Cincinnati and Detroit. Last season, the Cowboys dealt for the 38-year-old Kitna to back up starter Tony Romo. He gave them a lot more than expected – when Romo went down with a broken collarbone, Kitna stepped in and started nine games. All he did was complete 66% of his passes for over 2,300 yards and 16 touchdowns, good enough for a passer rating of 88.9, slightly better than the NFL average. The disappointing Cowboys, 6-10 last year, were a more respectable 4-5 when Kitna started. Given Kitna’s relatively paltry 2 million salary, part of a five-year, 12 contract he signed with Detroit in 2009, no QB in the league gave his club more or the money last year. Coming closest: Baltimore’s third-year man, Joe Flacco, who turned in a slightly better QB rating (93.6) for 35% more money (2.7 million). Flacco, a mid-first round pick out of the University of Delaware in 2008, has steadily improved over his three seasons while leading the Ravens to a 32-16 record and three straight playoff berths. Flacco’s five-year deal was commensurate with his draft status – no top ten money here – but he’s clearly on a pace to strike it rich by 2013. For now, the Ravens are enjoying the bargain. Quarterback rating, the yardstick by which the position is primarily measured, is figured by a statistical formula that works in completion percentage, touchdown passes and interceptions per attempt, along with yardage per attempt. The top rated passer in the league last year, New England’s Tom Brady (111.0 rating), earned a relatively modest 6.5 million as he played out the final year of a long term contract. That’s good enough to make him the seventh best quarterback for the buck for 2010. Brady has since cashed in with a four-year, 72 million extension, a deal that briefly made him the league’s highest paid player until the Colts’ Peyton Manning topped it with an extension of his own a few months later (Manning’s 15 million salary and 91.9 passer rating left him off the 2010 best for the buck list). Like Brady the Eagles’ Michael Vick took a turn on the Best of the Buck list before cashing in big time this season. After taking over the starting job early in early 2010, Vick turned in a 100.2 QB rating for just 5.5 million (and rushed for 676 yards to boot). He was rewarded – initially with a 15.7 million tender for this season, and then with an all-in 100 million extension. Others delivering above their pay grade: Oakland’s Jason Campbell (3.25 million; 84.5 rating) who led the Raiders to their best season in eight years after coming over from Washington, and Tampa Bay’s Josh Freeman (5 million; 95.9) a second-year man who threw for 25 TDs last year as the Bucs improved to 10-6 from 3-13 in 2009. And finally – sometimes big trades do work out for both teams. In 2009, the Chicago Bears and Denver Broncos decided to swap quarterbacks, with Jay Cutler going to Chicago and Kyle Orton to Denver. By 2010, both of them, making relatively modest salaries, rated among the ten best QB’s for the buck. What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the best quarterbacks for the buck, i.e., quarterbacks who performed exceptionally well relative to their salaries during the 2010 NFL season. The article highlights Jon Kitna, who provided exceptional value for the Dallas Cowboys as a backup quarterback at a modest salary of 2 million. Other notable mentions include Joe Flacco of the Baltimore Ravens, Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, and Michael Vick of the Philadelphia Eagles, all of whom outperformed their contracts and exhibited impressive quarterback ratings in the 2010 season. The article also talks about Jason Campbell, Josh Freeman, and the fair trade between the Chicago Bears and Denver Broncos involving Jay Cutler and Kyle Orton.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis of Heinrich being born in Czechoslovakia is true based on the information provided in the paragraph."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","output":"We are aware that it is difficult for the Commission and the Council to collect this data because there are member states that are not ready to provide it, probably because they have not conducted a study on the consequences of improving the procedures for deciding the status of refugee or international protection. In more detail, this statement acknowledges the challenges faced by institutions such as the Commission and the Council when it comes to gathering information from various member states about their procedures for granting refugee or international protection status. The difficulties might arise from the fact that some member states may not have conducted adequate research on the impact of enhancing their decision-making processes in this area, which might explain their reluctance or inability to share their data. There can be several reasons behind the lack of research on the consequences of improving the procedures for deciding refugee or international protection status. Firstly, member states might not have the necessary resources, expertise, or capacity to conduct comprehensive studies on this subject. It might be difficult for them to allocate funds, personnel, or time to such issues, particularly if they are already dealing with significant economic, social, or political challenges. Secondly, member states might have different priorities, with some countries placing a greater emphasis on border security, national identity, or public opinion, rather than on the humanitarian aspects of migration and asylum. As a result, their decision-making processes and criteria for granting refugee status or international protection might reflect these priorities, which could lead to less willingness to collaborate or share information on this topic. Thirdly, certain member states might simply be unwilling to disclose information about their procedures for granting refugee or international protection status due to national security or political reasons. Openly sharing data on these matters might be perceived as a sign of weakness or might reveal sensitive details about the state's approach to migration and asylum policy, which could be used against them by other countries or groups. Regardless of the reasons behind the lack of shared data, the statement emphasizes the importance of cooperation and collaboration among member states and European institutions like the Commission and the Council to improve the decision-making processes and the overall management of refugees and asylum seekers. By working together and sharing best practices, experiences, and expertise, member states can strengthen their capacity to address these challenges more effectively and create a more fair, transparent, and humane system for deciding on refugee and international protection status. In conclusion, the statement underlines the challenges faced by the Commission and the Council in collecting data from member states on their procedures for granting refugee or international protection status. The lack of research and shared information might be attributed to various factors, such as limited resources or capacity, different priorities, or national security concerns. However, fostering cooperation and collaboration among member states and European institutions is crucial for developing better mechanisms and approaches to dealing with this important issue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Procuring the pork belly can be the hardest part of the entire homemade-bacon process since most grocery stores don’t carry it. Try a local butcher or a restaurant supplier in your area to find the pork belly. Local butchers tend to have better quality pork bellies available than a restaurant supplier. Also, a restaurant supplier may only sell in bulk quantities much larger than what you need. Once you get the pork belly home from the butcher, rinse it thoroughly to remove any blood or anything else on the meant. Pat the pork belly dry and then transfer it to a resealable two-gallon plastic bag.  After you’ve cleaned and patted the pork belly dry, the surface will feel slightly tacky. You may also want to trim any thin edges off the pork belly if it has any. You want to place roughly a long rectangular piece into the plastic bag. To make the spice rub, mix the kosher salt, pink salt, brown sugar, honey, red pepper flakes, paprika, and cumin in a bowl. Mix until everything is spread evenly throughout the honey. This recipe is just one of a near endless variety you can use to create unique flavor profiles for your bacon. Other spice rub examples include:  2.5-3 pounds skinless pork belly, 1/4 cup kosher salt, 2 teaspoons pink curing salt, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon maple syrup, 1 tablespoon Bourbon, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and hickory smoke during the smoking process (whether actual hickory wood in your smoker or hickory liquid smoke roasted in your oven). 2 1/2 pounds skin-on pork belly, 2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, a tablespoon black peppercorns, 1 teaspoon fennel seed, 1 teaspoon caraway seed, 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, 1 teaspoon dried thyme, 2 bay leaves, 1 clove garlic, finely chopped.  1 pound of pork belly, 1 1/2 teaspoons Morton's kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon pink curing salt, 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce, 2 tablespoons honey, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon powdered ginger, 1 teaspoon powdered garlic, 1 teaspoon Sriracha or other hot sauce, 1/4 teaspoon 5 spice powder, and 2 tablespoons water. You’ll have enough of the spice rub to evenly coat the until piece of pork belly. Roll the mix around with the pork belly in the plastic bag until everything is coated. Seal the plastic bag and place it in the refrigerator. You’ll flip the bag once a day to keep the even coating, and the process will take approximately 7-10 days.  The duration ultimately depends on the thickness of the pork belly. A thin belly (around 1.5 inches thick) will take seven days while a thicker belly (2-3 inches) will take the entire ten days.  You can test how cured the pork belly is by touching it when you think it’s close to ready. The cured meat will be firm to the touch all over like a cooked steak. If it still feels spongy and soft, then it needs more time. Once the meat has cured, you can remove it from the bag and rinse it thoroughly. Discard any solids from the rub on the meat as well. Pat the meat dry once you have rinsed it well. After thoroughly rinsing the meat, you will need to refrigerate it again. Refrigerate it uncovered for a full forty-eight hours. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about making homemade bacon using a piece of meat called pork belly. It explains that you might need to go to a local butcher to find pork belly, and gives instructions on how to clean it, put it in a plastic bag, and prepare a special mix of spices called a spice rub to flavor the bacon. The article also gives different examples of spice rubs you can use. After preparing the pork belly with the spice rub, it needs to stay in the refrigerator and be flipped daily for 7-10 days.

You are given a new situation: Albert is a scientist who travels the planet looking for new species to discover and analyze. While on a safari in Australia, Albert discovered two new species of live-bearing tetrapods. In the first species, species C, the females had long gestational periods. In the second species, species D, the females had short gestational periods.  and a hint : From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.  Please answer this question : Which species will have shorter living individuals? A:","output":"Based on the information provided and the correlations inferred by Aristotle, we can determine the following: 1. Lifespan increases with gestation period. 2.

Given the question: Process:  - Sunlight shines on plants - Cells with chlorophyll in them capture the light energy - Plants absorb carbon dioxide through their stoma - Plants absorb water through their roots and other parts of themselves - Plants absorb minerals through their roots - Plants convert these inputs into sugars - Sugars can be used as energy sources - Oxygen and water are also produced - Excess water and oxygen are released through stoma and other parts of the plant.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a better root system happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a better root system can have a direct or indirect effect on the process. A more efficient root system would enable the plants to absorb water and minerals more effectively and in greater amounts. This would result in an increase in the rate at which these resources are available for the process of photosynthesis. Consequently, with more resources at hand, the plants can potentially convert more of these inputs into sugars and produce more oxygen as a byproduct. Indirectly, a better root system may help the plant to be more resistant to environmental challenges, such as drought or nutrient-poor soil. This can lead to a more stable and continuous supply of resources for photosynthesis, thus increasing the overall production of sugars and oxygen over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

MIT believe in the passion   of learning, the value of working and teaching methods. MIT's teaching power is quite strong. There are eight Nobel winners and many other national and international winners in the teacher group of MIT. MIT is proud of these top scholars and thinkers. The ratio   of teachers and students in MIT is about 1 to 7.5. About 63 percent of the classes have fewer than 20 students each. Only 4 percent of the classes have more than 100 students each. Most MIT students can learn courses that they like. The students in MIT have many activities when they finish their lessons, for example: Student Life And Culture Student Organizations Music & The Arts @ MIT Athletics Most students in famous universities feel serious pressure both in life and study.

In his office, on Christmas Eve, he hears that his former girlfriend, Kate, called him after many years. He walks into a convenience store where a lottery contestant, Cash, has a winning ticket worth 238. The store clerk does not believe Cash, so Cash pulls out a gun and Jack offers to buy the ticket.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the man who was arrested after the Yeomanry charged into a crowd, killing a child? , can you please find it?   The Peterloo Massacre took place at St Peter's Field, Manchester, England, on 16 August 1819, when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60,000–80,000 who had gathered to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated by the introduction of the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt. Shortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry to arrest Hunt and several others on the hustings with him. The Yeomanry charged into the crowd, knocking down a woman and killing a child, and finally apprehending Hunt. The 15th Hussars were then summoned by the magistrate, Mr Hulton, to disperse the crowd. They charged with sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 18 people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in an ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier. Historian Robert Poole has called the Peterloo Massacre one of the defining moments of its age. In its own time, the London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government to crack down on reform, with the passing of what became known as the Six Acts. It also led directly to the foundation of the Manchester Guardian, but had little other effect on the pace of reform. In a survey conducted by The Guardian in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial. Peterloo is commemorated by a plaque close to the site, a...

On Christmas Eve 1950, a man named Wilfred Butler, engulfed in flames, runs out of his mansion near the small town of East Willard, Massachusetts. His death is ruled accidental, and the house left to his grandson Jeffrey. Twenty years later in present day 1970, lawyer John Carter arrives in East Willard on Christmas Eve with his assistant and mistress Ingrid, having been charged by Jeffrey Butler to sell the house. Carter meets with the town's leading citizens: Mayor Adams; Sheriff Bill Mason; the taciturn Charlie Towman, who owns the local newspaper; and Tess Howard, who operates the town's telephone switchboard. They all agree to buy the Butler mansion on behalf of the town for the bargain price of 50,000, which Jeffrey Butler requires to be paid in cash the next day. Carter and Ingrid stay the night at the Butler mansion, unaware that they are being watched by an unseen man who has just escaped from a local mental hospital and just arrived in East Willard in a stolen car. After dinner, Carter and Ingrid retreat to a bedroom to have sex. Their unknown stalker enters the bedroom and brutally murders them both with an ax, and then reads from a Bible before placing a crucifix in Ingrid's hand. The killer calls the sheriff, asking him to come investigate Carter's disappearance, and introduces himself as the house's owner. While talking with Tess, who forwards his call, he calls himself \\"Marianne\\". At nightfall, Jeffrey Butler arrives at the mansion to meet with Carter, but finds it locked and empty. He drives to the mayor's home, where he meets Diane, the mayor's daughter. The mayor has gone to the county's bank to obtain the required cash for the payment, so she redirects Jeffrey to the sheriff's office.

Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981.

Question: suppose less carbon dioxide is removed happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen reaching the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If less carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs, it will have a negative effect on the efficiency of oxygen reaching the body. The reason for this is that the efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs relies on the balance between the two gases. In the alveoli (small air sacs) of the lungs, oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream, while carbon dioxide waste from the bloodstream diffuses into the alveoli to be exhaled. If there is more carbon dioxide in the lungs and less is being removed, this can result in an increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. This is referred to as hypercapnia. Hypercapnia can lead to respiratory acidosis, where there is an increase in acidity in the blood. One of the body's compensatory mechanisms to counteract this is to slow down the breathing rate, which results in less oxygen being inhaled and consequently, less oxygen being available to the body. This can lead to hypoxia, which is a decrease in the amount of oxygen available to your body's tissues. So, less carbon dioxide removed from the lungs will lead to less oxygen reaching the body due to an imbalance between the levels of both gases."},{"instruction":"What type of details about betty lou gerson  can be gathered from the following bio?

Question: what protects the vagina? Would \\"The Latinate plural \\"vaginae\\" is rarely used in English.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"No, the phrase \\"The Latinate plural 'vaginae' is rarely used in English\\" doesn't provide a reasonable answer to the question of what protects the vagina. The question is about the protective mechanisms or structures associated with the vagina, whereas the provided statement merely discusses the uncommon use of the term's plural form. A more reasonable and detailed answer to the question of what protects the vagina would be: The vagina, as a vital part of the female reproductive system, has several protective mechanisms and structures in place. These functions and components work together to maintain its overall health and prevent damage or infection. 1. Labia majora and labia minora: The outer and inner folds of skin, respectively, that surround the vaginal opening. These structures protect the vagina and other reproductive structures by covering them and preventing the entry of harmful substances. 2. Mucosal lining: The interior walls of the vagina are lined with mucosal tissue, which provides a barrier against infection and irritation. This lining also releases mucus and fluids that help to keep the vagina clean and moisturized. 3. Vaginal flora: The vagina contains a unique balance of bacteria, known as vaginal flora. The presence of these bacteria helps to maintain the vagina's acidic environment, which discourages the overgrowth of harmful pathogens. 4. Pubic hair: The growth of hair around the vaginal area serves as an additional barrier against harmful substances and can help to prevent irritation caused by friction. 5. Immune system: The vagina is equipped with immune system components, such as white blood cells and antibodies, which aid in identifying and eliminating potential threats such as harmful bacteria, viruses, and fungi. 6. Self-cleaning: The vagina is a self-cleaning organ, discharging fluids and dead cells to maintain internal cleanliness. This process also ensures the maintenance of its acidic environment, reducing the risk of infection. 7. The hymen: In some cases, a thin, flexible membrane called the hymen partially covers the vaginal opening. Although its function is not completely understood, it may provide some level of protection to the vagina during early stages of development. By understanding these protective mechanisms, it becomes clear that the vagina has evolved to exhibit a combination of unique structures and biological processes dedicated to its preservation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Quotations attributed in the Quaker Valley High School yearbook to a terrorist and two of history's most notorious mass murderers — Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi — have district leaders apologizing and offering refunds to families.      In an email Wednesday to parents, Quaker Valley School District leaders apologized for “offensive” quotes published in the graduating class section of the yearbook, which was distributed to students Monday.      “This is a regrettable mistake, as the school district would never knowingly condone this messaging in a school-sponsored publication,” the statement — signed by Superintendent Heidi Ondek, high school Principal Deborah Riccobelli and yearbook sponsor and English teacher Tamra Rosa — said. “We are well aware of the emotions this has conjured in many of our students and their families, and for that we are sorry.”      “Though the content of the quotes was reviewed thoroughly, the attributions clearly were not,” the statement said.      District spokeswoman Angela Yingling said students bring quotes in for approval and that “publishing the quotes is a shared responsibility of the yearbook staff, sponsor and administration.”      She did not say if students or the yearbook sponsor would face punishment.      The quotations in question include, “Words build bridges into unexplored regions,” attributed to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler; “Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, so why would we let them have ideas?” attributed to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin; and “Be just: the unjust never prosper. Be valiant. Keep your word, even to your enemies,” attributed to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State terrorist group.      Senior Dominique Cagliuso said she was disappointed to see the quotes from fellow classmates and wondered how the quotations made it in.      “It makes the entire senior class look badly,” she said. “It's also confusing how nobody caught it before it went out.      “It's one thing to have a silly quote from your favorite TV show, but to have a quote from dictators is disrespectful.”      Cagliuso said she likely would opt for stickers — to be offered by the district — to cover the quotations before her graduation party.      “When I'm passing it around with my family, I don't want them to see that part of it.”      Yingling said 360 yearbooks were distributed. Costs for the yearbooks range from 69 “but can be more than 100, depending on if the student opted to get their name engraved on the front,” she said.      The district is offering students a refund for those wishing not to keep the yearbooks and are offering stickers to cover up “any offensive quotations,” the district said in a statement.      School board President Sarah Heres said she is “confident steps will be taken to ensure this lack of oversight does not happen again.”      “The board is pleased with the swift response from the school administration,” she said. “We are glad to see options for students and families regarding this year's publication.”      The high school enrolls more than 630 students in grades 9 through 12, according to its website.      Bobby Cherry is a Tribune-Review staff writer. ||||| LEETSDALE, Pa.

The yearbooks cost at least 69, but can go for more than 100 if students have their names engraved, district spokeswoman Angela Yingling said.      Students submit quotes from famous people for inclusion in the yearbook, but Yingling said, \\"publishing the quotes is a shared responsibility of the yearbook staff, sponsor and administration.\\"      The district won't say if students or anyone else faces punishment for the quotes.

The student, Carla Fontes, had agreed to the bet with her coach, which stipulated that if she lost a wrestling match, he would cut her hair to demonstrate the ease of wrestling with shorter hair. The incident took place during a team meeting on Monday, where Fontes reportedly allowed Haraguchi to cut her hair, despite her mother Arlette Fontes' express disapproval.

A piece of her body.\\" Carla Fontes, who harbors a deep passion for wrestling, has a pragmatic outlook on the hair-cutting incident, commenting, \\"It is what it is.\\" Regardless of her acceptance, the controversial act raises questions on the boundaries of student-coach relationships and the role of personal bets in school sports. The suspension of Coach Haraguchi reinforces the importance of adhering to appropriate conduct within a school setting, as well as considering the involvement of parental consent when making decisions that impact students' lives.

Answer the following question: The address I had been given was a flophouse called Casa Salvador in the scummy side of downtown, the part where the city's redevelopment (read: \\"gentrification\\") efforts hadn't yet managed to drive out the sundry undesirable elements. I walked inside past the front lobby. I could tell the desk manager wanted to hassle me, but he was too busy arguing with a middle-aged peroxide-blonde woman in a leopard-print top. Her skin was leathery and weather beaten, and I guessed she was the type who was actually a good ten years younger than she looked. I made my way up the narrow staircase that smelled of urine and bleach, going all the way to the third floor. I continued down the dimly lit hallway, past a series of closed doors that muffled the sounds of women faking moans of pleasure. Room 313 was down at the far end of the hall, and its door was already slightly ajar. I knocked anyways, but there was no answer. Pushing the door open just enough to poke my head in, I called, \\"Hello? Is anybody in there?\\" There was no response, so I went in and felt along the wall for the light switch. A single weak bulb came on, lighting up the tiny, sparse room with a dim yellow glow. The room was about 8 feet by 8 feet, and the only furniture was a dingy, unmade bed and a metal foot locker. There were no windows, no closet, and no bathroom. As I stepped all the way in, I noticed a wooden baseball bat propped up beside the door. My watch said 6:20 - twenty minutes late for the interview. I sat on the edge of the bed to wait, hoping that maybe my contact had just stepped out momentarily. After a few minutes, a phone started ringing out in the hallway. I let it ring six times with no one answering before I decided to get it - partly in the off chance it was my contact, but mostly out of morbid curiosity as to what kind of business someone would have calling this dump. How did he feel when he saw the bat? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Disgusted.  B. not enough information  C. Concerned.  D. Curious. Answer:","output":"C. Concerned. When the protagonist saw the wooden baseball bat propped up beside the door, he likely felt concerned. This concern could arise from various reasons, such as the bat possibly indicating a dangerous situation or reflecting the kind of environment the flophouse was in. The fact that he was in a seedy part of town, surrounded by unsavory characters and in a rundown building, would also contribute to his concern about the presence of the bat."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Notably, the most broadly influential innovation of 20th-century American tort law was the rule of strict liability for defective products, which originated with judicial glosses on the law of warranty. In 1963, Roger J. Traynor of the Supreme Court of California threw away legal fictions based on warranties and imposed strict liability for defective products as a matter of public policy in the landmark case of Greenman v. Yuba Power Products. The American Law Institute subsequently adopted a slightly different version of the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which was published in 1964 and was very influential throughout the United States. Outside the U.S., the rule was adopted by the European Economic Community in the Product Liability Directive of July 1985 by Australia in July 1992 and by Japan in June 1994.

What is the answer: With which book did Peter Carey win the 1988 Booker award?","output":"Peter Carey won the 1988 Booker Prize for his novel \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\". This novel is one of Carey's most famous works and is a significant contribution to modern literary fiction. \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\" is set in the 19th century and carries themes of love, destiny, passion, and faith. What makes this book unique is how it combines historical fiction with elements of magical realism. The narrative unfolds through the lives of two main characters - Oscar Hopkins, an Anglican minister with a passion for gambling, and Lucinda Leplastrier, a wealthy Australian heiress with a similarly strong passion for gambling.  The story revolves around the unusual bond Oscar and Lucinda form over a shared obsession with gambling. Despite their cultural differences and the societal expectations of Victorian-era England and Australia, their shared compulsions unite them in a most unexpected way. As their story progresses, the novel explores themes of destiny, obsession, and the destructive power of love and faith. This novel was applauded for many reasons. Its vivid characterisation, rich narrative and the way it deals with themes of faith and chance were highly appreciated. The backdrop of 19th-century Australia complements the storyline as it adds an exotic flavor and helps in creating engaging plot devices. The characters' shared obsession with gambling was an innovative plot element for a period set novel, making it simultaneously unconventional and compelling. The resonance and acclaim of \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\" is further enhanced by its receipt of the Booker Prize in 1988, a premier recognition in the world of literature. The Booker Prize is awarded each year for the best original full-length novel, written in the English language, and published in the United Kingdom. Carey's win solidified his standing as an internationally renowned author. In a broader sense, \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\" represents Carey's talent in creating complex, memorable characters while simultaneously presenting readers with profound philosophical questions. The novel's exploration of love, faith and destiny against the backdrop of historical and geographical settings is a testament to Carey's storytelling skills and the depth of his narratives. This is part of what earned \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\" the Booker Prize in 1988, and has since made it a recognized classic of modern literature."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What began in 1971 as theprefix = st1 /MagicKingdomnow includes the high-tech, movie-mad Disney and Animal Kingdom. Each time the park expands, so do your chances to spend money. How can you save? As a family guide to Disney World, I've been to the park more than 25 times with my kids, and I've developed a few money-saving plans.     * Buy the five-day All-in-One Hopper Pass  . Even if you're visiting for fewer days, it's a deal (the pass costs  229 for visitors ages 10 and up,  183 for kids ages three to nine and is free for kids under age three). Without the pass, you'll have to pay separately for PleasureIslandand the water parks. A single trip toBlizzardBeach, for example, would cost a family of four  100. * Dine out at lunch. The prices at some of the nicer restaurants, especially those in Epcot's World Showcase, are much lower at noontime than at dinner. It's wise to make reservations before you leave home. Call 407-W-DISNEY. * Become a Gold Card Member. For 65, you can get a Magic Kingdom Club Gold Card (call 1-800-56-DISNEY). Card-holders get up to 20 percent off Disney hotel rooms, plus price breaks on character breakfasts, theme park tickets and goods from Disney stores. * Don't pay extra to see a character. Character-theme dinner shows are expensive, costing a family of four about  140, and even a character breakfast, where Mickey or Donald Duck joins you for cakes, can  _  50. If your budget is tight, try to meet the characters inside the theme parks and at free in-park shows. You can watch the Diamond Horseshoe show, for example, in theMagicKingdomfor no additional cost, while the similarly themed Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue requires expensive tickets. * Wait until the end of your trip to buy souvenirs. By then, the kids will really know what they want, and you won't waste money on expensive things. Question: If you are short of money, the writer suggests   _  . Options: A: you should not buy things for the kids from Disney stores B: you should not buy souvenirs at the beginning of the trip C: you should not make a trip toBlizzardBeach D: you should not have your meals out at noontime The answer is:","output":"B: you should not buy souvenirs at the beginning of the trip In the article, the writer suggests waiting until the end of the trip to buy souvenirs.

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If there is less energy from sunlight, it will result in less solar power being generated. The reason behind this is that the energy from sunlight is required to knock electrons loose in both the negatively and positively charged fields. When there's less energy to do this, the flow of electrons from negative to positive will be reduced, leading to diminished electricity generation.

In the following months, Jericho became a major force in The Invasion storyline in which WCW and ECW joined forces to overtake the WWF. Jericho remained on the side of the WWF despite previously competing in WCW and ECW. However, Jericho began slow turning into a villain by showing jealousy toward fellow WWF member The Rock. They faced each other in a match at No Mercy for the WCW Championship after Jericho defeated Rob Van Dam in a number one contenders match. Jericho won the WCW Championship when he pinned The Rock after debuting a new finisher, the Breakdown, onto a steel chair, winning his first world title in the process. One night later, the two put their differences aside and won the WWF Tag Team title from the Dudley Boyz.  After they lost the title to Test and Booker T, they continued their feud. On the November 5 episode of Raw, The Rock defeated Jericho to regain the WCW Championship. Following the match, Jericho attacked The Rock with a steel chair. At Survivor Series, Jericho solidified his heel turn by almost costing The Rock, and the WWF, victory in their elimination matchup by attacking The Rock again. At Vengeance, Jericho defeated both The Rock for the WCW Championship (unbranded and only referred to as the World Championship following Survivor Series) and Stone Cold Steve Austin for his first WWF Championship on the same night to become the first wrestler to hold both championships at the same time, which made him the first-ever Undisputed WWF Champion, as well as the fourth Grand Slam winner under the original format.

In your bathtub, you may even use No-Slip tape. No-slip is another way of saying the items has a lot of friction. In Figure 1.9, the blades of the skates are very smooth. Thats why you cant slide across ice with shoes. The soles of your shoes are much rougher than skates. The rougher surface of shoes causes more friction and slows you down. Heavier objects also have more friction. A heavy object presses down with more force. The surfaces are held together more tightly. This makes the surfaces harder to slide past each other. Did you ever try to push something heavy across the floor? Heavy objects are much harder to push than light objects.

Based on the paragraph, the reason you can't slide across an ice in your shoes the way you would in skates is actually because the soles of your shoes are rougher than the smooth blades of the skates. Remember when we talked about rough and smooth things? It's kinda like trying to slide on a bumpy road compared to a smooth, polished floor. The bumpy road - which is like the soles of your shoes - makes it harder for you to slide because there is more friction or 'stickiness' between it and the ground.

Which fruit has varieties called Smooth Cayenne, Red Spanish and Sugarloaf?","output":"The fruit with varieties called Smooth Cayenne, Red Spanish, and Sugarloaf is the pineapple. Pineapple, scientifically known as Ananas comosus, is a tropical plant with an edible multiple fruit consisting of coalesced berries. It is native to South America, specifically the region that stretches between southern Brazil and Paraguay. Pineapples are now cultivated in various tropical and subtropical regions around the world for their delicious and refreshing fruit, and they play a vital role in global fruit production. Let's explore each variety in more detail: 1. Smooth Cayenne: This is the most widely grown and well-known variety of pineapple, accounting for about 70% of global pineapple production. The Smooth Cayenne pineapple originates from the Guiana region in South America and was later introduced to Hawaii, where it became the dominant cultivar. This variety is characterized by its cylindrical shape, golden-yellow skin, and a uniform texture of its sweet, mild-flavored flesh. The fruit is both juicy and fibrous, with low acidity, and it is often used for both fresh consumption and canning. The plant has spineless leaves, which makes it easier for growers to handle during cultivation and harvesting. 2. Red Spanish: Also called \\"Florida Special\\" or \\"Kona Sugarloaf\\", the Red Spanish pineapple is a popular variety in the Caribbean, Mexico, Florida, and some parts of Central and South America. The fruit has a more compact and round shape compared to Smooth Cayenne, and its skin has a reddish-brown color when ripe. The flesh of the Red Spanish pineapple is pale-yellow, sweet, and aromatic, with a high fiber content and a slightly more acidic taste than the Smooth Cayenne. This variety is particularly suitable for fresh fruit consumption, as its firmer texture makes it less suitable for canning. The plant has spiny, bluish-grey leaves, which distinguishes it from the Smooth Cayenne. 3. Sugarloaf: The Sugarloaf pineapple, also known as \\"Pan de Azúcar\\" or \\"Kaua'i Sugarloaf\\", is named after its distinct conical, almost sugarloaf-like shape. This variety is highly regarded for its sweet and juicy white or pale-yellow flesh with low acidity, making it an excellent choice for fresh fruit consumption. The fruit's core is more tender than in other varieties, and many people consider it edible. The skin of the Sugarloaf pineapple is light green, even when ripe, which can make it difficult to determine its optimal ripeness. Sugarloaf pineapples are primarily grown in the Caribbean, Central and South America, and the Hawaiian island of Kauai. All three varieties of pineapple—Smooth Cayenne, Red Spanish, and Sugarloaf—are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, providing various health benefits. Pineapples contain a unique enzyme called bromelain, which aids digestion, reduces inflammation, and may provide therapeutic effects. Pineapples also offer high amounts of vitamin C, manganese, and dietary fiber, all of which contribute to a well-rounded, nutritious diet. Despite these differences in appearance, taste, and texture, each variety of pineapple is enjoyed worldwide for its unique and delicious flavor profile, making them a popular choice for fresh fruit consumption and use in various dishes and beverages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mussolini appoints General Rodolfo Graziani (Oliver Reed) as his sixth governor to Libya, confident that the eminently accredited soldier and fascist Grande can crush the rebellion and restore the dissipated glories of Imperial Rome. Omar Mukhtar (Anthony Quinn) leads the resistance to the fascists. A teacher by profession, guerrilla by obligation, Mukhtar had committed himself to a war that cannot be won in his own lifetime. Graziani controls Libya with the might of the Italian Army. Tanks and aircraft are used in the desert for the first time. The Italians also committed atrocities: killing of prisoners of war, destruction of crops, and imprisoning populations in concentration camps behind barbed wire. Despite their bravery, the Libyan Arabs and Berbers suffered heavy losses, their relatively primitive weaponry was no match for mechanised warfare; despite all this, they continued to fight, and managed to keep the Italians from achieving complete victory for 20 years. Graziani was only able to achieve victory through deceit, deception, violation of the laws of war and human rights, and by the use of tanks and aircraft. Despite their lack of modern weaponry, Graziani recognised the skill of his adversary in waging guerrilla warfare. In one scene, Mukhtar refuses to kill a defenseless young officer, instead giving him the Italian flag to return with. Mukhtar says that Islam forbids him to kill captured soldiers and demands that he only fight for his homeland, and that Muslims are taught to hate war itself.

I'm not buying it.\\" can be translated as \\"Jo. To nekupuju.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"Yeah\\" is an informal way of saying \\"Yes\\" in English, and it can be translated as \\"Jo\\" in Czech, which is a colloquial and informal way of saying \\"Ano.\\" - \\"I'm\\" is the abbreviated form of \\"I am,\\" which indicates the first person singular pronoun \\"I\\" and a present tense form of the verb \\"to be.\\" In Czech, \\"I\\" is translated to \\"já,\\" and \\"am\\" can be translated as \\"jsem.\\" However, in casual speech, Czech speakers often omit the subject and the verb \\"to be,\\" especially if the context is clear. - \\"not buying\\" is a negated form of the verb \\"to buy\\" (kupovat) in the present continuous tense. In Czech, the negation is achieved by adding the word \\"ne\\" before the verb. The verb \\"to buy\\" can be translated to \\"kupovat\\" and its first person singular form is \\"kupuju.\\" When negated, it becomes \\"ne\\" + \\"kupuju\\" = \\"nekupuju.\\" - \\"it\\" is a pronoun that refers to an object or situation previously mentioned or described. In Czech, \\"it\\" can be translated to \\"to\\" or \\"ono,\\" depending on the gender and case. In this context, the neutral gender \\"to\\" is used, matching the gender of the verb \\"kupovat.\\" So, combining these elements, we get the Czech translation: \\"Jo.

Write a \\"(a).\\" movie review (Pick from: (a). negative. (b). positive.).","output":"I will write a negative movie review for the film \\"The Emoji Movie\\" (2017) directed by Tony Leondis. Review Title: A Dizzying Parade of Emojis Falling Flat on Faces Step 1: Introduction and premise of the movie The Emoji Movie, released in 2017, leaps into the kaleidoscopic world of communication apps and social media with emojis as the central characters. The foray aims to explore the lives of these animated beings that are ubiquitous in our tech-savvy era, but, unfortunately, the movie crumbles under the weight of its unoriginal plot and lackluster humor. Step 2: Discuss characterization and voice performances While a talented cast has lent their voices to the movie – featuring T.J. Miller as Gene, the protagonist 'Meh' emoji, and James Corden as his sidekick Hi-5 – the one-dimensional characters restrict the actors from showcasing their potential fully. The predictable arcs further hamper the experience, offering no real character development throughout the film. Step 3: Comment on the storytelling and script The plot, centered around Gene's quest to rid himself of a malfunction that grants him multiple expressions, borrows heavily from other animated classics, diluting the unique potential of this emoji-centric premise. The script, laden with trite jokes and on-the-nose references to social media culture, fails to evoke the intended laughter and effortlessly falls flat. Step 4: Discuss animation and visuals Despite the potential for creatively showcasing the digital world, the animation merely provides a visual bombardment of recognizable app icons and landscapes without any real substance or flair. While the film designers attempt to blend reality with the digital environment, the final result amounts to nothing more than a dazzling advertisement for popular tech giants. Step 5: Conclude the review In conclusion, The Emoji Movie is a lackluster experience that unsuccessfully attempts to capitalize on the social media craze. With its unoriginal storyline, forgettable characters, and missed opportunities in animation, the film leaves viewers reaching for the 'Meh' emoji themselves. It's a disappointing spectacle that may be best suited for passing the time on a rainy day, but only when all other options have been exhausted."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The group started in the early 1980s with Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose (and originally Norvell Austin). The late 1980s saw a new incarnation, consisting of Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane, compete in JCP and WCW and shortly feuding with \\"The Original Midnight Express\\" of Condrey and Rose. In the 1990s, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) combined Bob Holly and Bart Gunn as \\"The New Midnight Express\\". Due to various differences over the direction of the Midnight Express, Cornette, Lane and Eaton also left JCP for a short while, around the time that Ted Turner bought out Jim Crockett and began promoting the federation under the name World Championship Wrestling (WCW). When the issues were resolved, Cornette and the Midnight Express returned to the promotion. In the tournament to determine new World tag team champions, the Midnight Express advanced to the finals before losing to the Freebirds with some assistance from the Samoan Swat Team. They engaged in a feud with the Freebirds and Samoans until the 1989 Great American Bash, where they teamed up with the Road Warriors and Dr. Death Steve Williams to defeat the Freebirds and Samoans in a War Games match.  The Midnight Express soon turned heel as a result of a feud with the Dynamic Dudes (Johnny Ace & Shane Douglas). Jim Cornette duped the Dudes into thinking he wanted to be their manager but then turned on them during their match against the Midnight Express at Clash of the Champions IX in New York. The Dynamic Dudes gained a measure of revenge when the Midnight Express laid out an open challenge for any team for 10,000. After dispatching of a couple of no-name teams, the Express was challenged by the masked Dynamic Duo, billed from Gotham City, who pinned the Express and unmasked as Ace and Douglas. The feud soon lost steam and was forgotten soon after.  After returning to their cheating ways, the Midnight Express started a feud with the up-and-coming team of Flyin' Brian and \\"Z-Man\\" Tom Zenk over the United States Tag team titles. The Express won the titles from the young team in early 1990, but lost them to The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) three months later. After a loss at Halloween Havoc 1990, the Midnight Express split up when Jim Cornette and Stan Lane left the federation. For the first time in almost a decade there was no Midnight Express. Did anybody leave the federation?","output":"Yes, after a loss at Halloween Havoc 1990, the Midnight Express team split up and Jim Cornette and Stan Lane left the federation.

These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.  I am facing a new situation today: Jill and Bob are working on a construction site together when suddenly two wooden planks fall from three stories up. One plank hits Bob on the head and the other lands directly on Jill's shoulder. Everyone rushes over to them to check if they are ok. All the people are relieved that Bob and Jill appear to be alright, but they urge them both to go visit a doctor to get checked out.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person is more likely to have trouble talking? The answer is:","output":"Based on the background article and the information provided about the new situation with Bob and Jill, Bob is more likely to have trouble talking. This is because the article mentions that a person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage, which can result from an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body. In this case, Bob was hit on the head by a wooden plank, which could potentially cause a traumatic brain injury. The brain is responsible for controlling speech and language functions, and if Bob's brain is injured due to the impact of the falling wooden plank, he may face difficulty in talking. This difficulty could manifest in the form of slurred speech, difficulty forming words, or reduced ability to understand and produce language. On the other hand, Jill was hit on her shoulder, which, while it may cause localized pain and injury, does not directly impact the brain or its ability to control speech. Of course, it's important to note that the severity of any injury depends on various factors, including the force of the impact, the exact location of the injury, and the individual's overall health. Therefore, it is essential that both Bob and Jill consult a doctor to assess their respective injuries and receive appropriate medical care. Nonetheless, given the information provided and the knowledge acquired from the background article, it can be concluded that Bob is more likely to have trouble talking due to the potential brain injury resulting from the impact to his head."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The equation is already in a form known as a linear equation, which can be represented as ax + b = c, where x is the variable we want to solve for. In this case, the variable is c, so the equation can be represented as -16*c - 2 = -2. Follow these steps to solve for c: Step 1: Try to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. In our case, the constant term on the left side is -2, so to eliminate it you would add 2 to both sides of the equation: -16*c - 2 + 2 = -2 + 2 Now, simplify: -16*c = 0 Step 2: Solve for c by isolating the term containing c. Now our equation looks like this: -16*c = 0 To isolate the term containing c, we need to divide by the coefficient of c, which is -16. So, divide both sides of the equation by -16: (-16*c) / -16 = 0 / -16 After dividing: c = 0 With these steps, we've found that c equals 0 in the given equation -16*c - 2 = -2."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One has to wonder, is there any point at which the main stream media and the public get some self-respect and toss out this loser? First he asked for your wedding gifts, then your yard sales and now he has asked for your daughters.      Just in case you didn’t watch Obama’s newest ad, and who could really blame you, it’s aimed at young, female voters who may be virgin… voters. The actress gushes about how special the first guy should be and how you wouldn’t want to show up at a party and be discovered as being, “not ready.” Lena Dunham allows herself to be used in this cheap, last minute attempt to be the first for young women. Dunham, who was raised in a wealthy, over-sexualized household and who started therapy at age 7 must somewhat be forgiven for her role; she seems to have a thing for talking about her first time, the Obama administration was just happy to oblige. The problem is, this is an adult man, with two young daughters, who should know better.      Perhaps it’s just another message to be transmitted to Vladimir though. Ironically, Obama’s “Virgin” ad, as it has been dubbed, isn’t the first. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin released two ads urging young women to make sure their first time is with someone they love. The mainstream media labeled the ads creepy and were clearly turned off by the inappropriate propaganda. Now the question is what excuse will the media and the left find to justify their president mimicking the leader of Russia.      He may not win reelection, but he most certainly has won the award for degrading what should be the highest office in the country. ||||| This is a set of web collections curated by Mark Graham using the Archive-IT service of the Internet Archive.

Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \\"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\\" and coining the term \\"Darwinism\\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science.

Сейчас в Украине стоит вопрос о создании национальных парков, а также нужно брать под охрану отдельные деревья, которые есть по всей территории Украины. Translate this to English?","output":"Currently in Ukraine, the question of creating national parks is being considered, and there is also a need to protect individual trees that are found throughout the territory of Ukraine. The establishment of national parks in Ukraine is an important step towards the conservation and preservation of the country's rich natural heritage. National parks serve not only as recreational areas for the public, but also as wildlife sanctuaries, and they contribute significantly to the preservation of biodiversity and the maintenance of ecological balance. The creation of national parks in Ukraine would be an essential addition to the existing system of protected areas, which already includes nature reserves, regional landscape parks, protected natural areas, and more. In national parks, the focus is often on both the preservation of ecosystems and the development of sustainable tourism, which can contribute to regional economic development and create job opportunities. In addition to establishing national parks, the protection and preservation of individual trees throughout Ukraine is also a significant issue. Individual trees can possess high ecological, cultural, historical, or aesthetic value, and their protection can contribute to the conservation of ecosystems and the enhancement of urban and rural landscapes. Such trees can often serve as natural landmarks, provide a sense of identity and history for communities, and maintain the balance of the local environment. In order to effectively protect individual trees, it is necessary to establish a monitoring system that would help to identify and assess those trees that deserve protection and to develop appropriate management measures for their preservation, such as tree planting and maintenance, pest control, and regular inspections for signs of disease or damage. Moreover, by safeguarding individual trees, Ukraine can bolster educational and awareness-raising initiatives to promote the importance of trees and forests at the local community level. This would help to foster a sense of stewardship of the natural environment, encourage responsible use of resources, and instill appreciation for the beauty and diversity of the country's natural landscapes. In conclusion, the creation of national parks and the protection of individual trees throughout the territory of Ukraine are essential components of a comprehensive strategy for the conservation and enhancement of the country's natural heritage. By implementing these measures, Ukraine can preserve its unique ecosystems, promote sustainable development, and ensure a lasting legacy of natural beauty for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Break down sentences into their core components (subject, verb, object, and details like color and body part). 2. Compare the components for similarity. 3. Assign a similarity score based on the comparison. Step 1: Break down sentences into their core components: - Sentence 1: subject (a black and white dog), verb (is carrying), object (a stick), detail (in its mouth) - Sentence 2: subject (the black and white dog), verb (has), object (a stick), detail (in his paws) Step 2: Compare the components for similarity: - Subject: Both subjects refer to the same kind of dog, so they are very similar. The articles (\\"a\\" vs. \\"the\\") differ slightly, but this distinction is minor. - Verb: The verbs \\"is carrying\\" and \\"has\\" both imply possession, but \\"carrying\\" indicates an action of physically holding the object, while \\"has\\" could potentially include the stick being nearby. So, they are somewhat similar, but not completely. - Object: \\"A stick\\" is the same object in both sentences, so they are identical for this component. - Detail: The details, however, differ by using different body parts ('mouth' vs. 'paws'). The overall meaning is similar, as the dog is still holding the object within its body, but because a different anatomical part is used, this decreases the similarity. Step 3: Assign a similarity score based on the comparison: Considering the similarities and differences between the components, I would assign a similarity score of 3.5 out of 5. While both sentences involve a black and white dog with a stick, the verbs used and the body parts mentioned are not exactly the same but still convey the idea of the dog possessing the stick."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q: Passage: The new Ottoman army arrived on the island during the winter of 1666/1667, and in May, the final phase of the siege, overseen by the Grand Vizier himself, began. It would last for 28 months and cost the lives of 70,000 Ottoman soldiers, 38,000 conscripted Cretans and slaves who labored in the Ottoman siege works and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders. Faced with the renewed Ottoman assault and a struggling economy, despite the prospect of considerable reinforcements from Western Europe, in 1668 the Signoria hoped to end the war by striking a peace settlement with the Ottomans. Indeed, the Venetians hoped to use the imminent arrival of reinforcements to secure concessions from the Ottomans. Admiral Andrea Valier was at first appointed as envoy, but fell ill and was quickly replaced by the elderly nobleman Alvise da Molin. Molin and his embassy traveled to Larissa, where the Ottoman court resided during one of the Sultan's hunting expeditions. The Ottomans proposed that Venice keep one half of Crete, but the Signoria, emboldened by further pledges of reinforcements, especially from France, and renewed turmoil at the Ottoman court and within the Empire, refused the offer. Molin, in the meantime transported by the Ottomans to Canea in Crete, was ordered to continue negotiations and to continue observing the Ottomans' strength and intentions, but not commit himself or the Republic.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. At The Washington Post/Univision debate in Miami, Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton panned Donald Trump, vowed to reform immigration and sparred over their respective records. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)      Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed in a debate sponsored by The Washington Post and Univision on Wednesday night, the day after a win in the Michigan primary breathed new life into Sanders's underdog campaign.      The duel in Miami was the final one on the schedule (for now, at least) and gave the candidates their last, best chance to set a course for the rest of the race with a national audience watching.      How did they do? Below are our winners and losers.      WINNERS      Hillary Clinton: This debate was a minefield for her. She was coming off a disappointing loss in Michigan that gave Sanders some momentum. She got asked about possibly being indicted (!), about whether she lied about Benghazi and about about her being seen as untrustworthy. And the moderators demanded answers. Clinton avoided a disaster and came out as the better debater, yet again. And despite a couple missteps -- she STILL doesn't have a good answer on her Wall Street speeches?!? -- she had some very strong moments that will likely endure more than anything else.      The crowd yelled and booed during the debate in Miami as moderator Jorge Ramos asked former secretary of state Hillary Clinton if she lied to the families of the Benghazi victims. (The Washington Post)      When asked about her poor honesty ratings and her not-so-great public image, she had this to say: \\"I am not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed, like my husband or President Obama.” She added: \\"This is not easy for me.\\" It was self-aware, and it turned a question about her not being honest into an answer in which she was uniquely candid. And then there was the moment she was speaking directly to a woman whose family had been broken up via deportation. Univision's Enrique Acevedo translated Clinton's heartfelt, slowly spoken answer in this indelible image, with Clinton featuring in a small splitscreen most of the time (though not in this particular image):      Can't get this image out of my mind. pic.twitter.com/FDw1VD0EHN — Irin Carmon (@irin) March 10, 2016      Bernie Sanders's suit: The man wore a BROWN SUIT. (Or maybe it was blue? No. No, it was brown.) This was basically all anybody could talk about on social media for the first 10 minutes. The Fix is on-record in support of non-traditional fashion choices. Think: Marco Rubio's boots. And President Obama's tan suit. We have seen way too many political men wearing blue and charcoal suits over the years, and Sanders boldly went where no presidential candidate has gone before ... er, at least in a long time. One issue, though, Bernie: No more button-down collars. They should only be worn sans tie.      Ted Kennedy: When it comes to a Democratic primary with a premium on getting to the left, the liberal lion of the Senate is bound to get some mentions. He was basically the Democrats' own version of Ronald Reagan on Wednesday night, as Clinton recalled the immigration reform he spearheaded in 2007. Clinton noted that Sanders opposed the bill -- suggesting a guilt-by-lack-of-association with Kennedy. Sanders, meanwhile, assured us twice that Kennedy was a very \\"close friend.\\"      Moderators: Look, Clinton supporters and Clinton herself won't like the fact that Jorge Ramos asked the former secretary of state about being indicted. And they probably really won't like that he pressed her for a firmer \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" on whether she would deport illegal immigrant children. But this debate featured something that is often lacking in debates -- follow-ups that demand firm positions. Ramos and The Post's own Karen Tumulty regularly pressed the two candidates when they didn't give a solid answer, trying to get an affirmative or a negative. It's not easy, but every moderator should do this. Candidates obfuscate way too much.      LOSERS      Sanders's chances at the nomination: As noted above, this was the last debate we currently have scheduled. This was Sanders's chance, after a big win in Michigan, to change the course of the race. And he was aggressive. He tried. He's getting better. He even handled a very tough question (in South Florida, no less) about his past praise for Fidel Castro. But he didn't do anything to change the fact that Clinton remains the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Sanders will likely continue to amass delegates and win some states, but he still needs that game-changer to really make this a race. He didn't get it on Wednesday night. And one wonders where else it might come from.      Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders went on the attack after rival Hillary Clinton accused him of supporting the anti-immigration Minutemen. \\"Madam Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week,\\" he said. (The Washington Post)      Clinton's attacks: Clinton attacked Sanders in a series of ways that are, well, pretty disingenuous. After attacking him for being against the auto bailout at Sunday's debate -- he voted for it but was against the bank bailout -- Clinton doubled down on some similarly odd lines of attack Wednesday. She tied him to Republicans for opposing Ted Kennedy's immigration bill and suggested he supports the anti-illegal immigrant Minutemen. She noted a Koch brothers group is running an ad thanking Sanders for voting against the Export-Import Bank. And she (yet again) suggested he's trying to undo Obamacare by replacing it with single-payer health care. In each case, it's as if Clinton is painting Sanders as an ally of Republicans. In each case, that's just not true. Mostly, he's taking these positions because he's further to the left than most Democrats. Peter Hamby said it well:      How many Democrats out there believe that Bernie supports the Koch Brothers & The Minutemen, and opposes Obamacare and auto bailout? — Peter Hamby (@PeterHamby) March 10, 2016      Being a senator: Just in case you forgot that being a senator is not a great thing when it comes to becoming president, this debate should disavow disabuse you of that. Voting on large packages allows your opponents to pick out one thing that you might or might not support or oppose, and tar you with it over and over again. Plus, you are constantly weighing in on the issues of the day in your public comments. Immigration is case in point. Both candidates struggled Wednesday to explain away things that made them sound not terribly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform. One wonders if voters who care about that issue -- Latinos, in particular -- liked either of their answers.      Clinton Throws Flash Grenade To Divert Attention From Question About Senate Voting Record https://t.co/FPky1Ka1S5 pic.twitter.com/F1XfSHaoFt — Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) March 10, 2016 ||||| Both Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders spoke passionately about the desire to stop deporting immigrants who entered the country illegally and to provide a path to citizenship at The Washington Post/Univision debate in Miami. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)      Both Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders spoke passionately about the desire to stop deporting immigrants who entered the country illegally and to provide a path to citizenship at The Washington Post/Univision debate in Miami. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)      Democrats got a taste Wednesday night of where their nominating contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders could be heading — toward a grueling and increasingly contentious battle that could continue until the primaries end in June.      A few days ago, Wednesday’s debate here appeared as if it might be an anticlimax as Clinton rolled toward the nomination. Instead, Sanders arrived reenergized and reinvigorated after his surprising victory in Michigan. Rather than questions about Sanders’s viability, Clinton faced questions about what had gone wrong with her campaign.      The two squabbled at length over immigration. They traded charges over bailing out the automobile industry. They argued again over health care and about how to combat climate change. A quiet start turned into a spirited and at times tense series of exchanges that highlighted their differences and the state of their competition.      Clinton sought to brush aside her Michigan loss, pointing to a big victory in Mississippi and the fact that she emerged with more total delegates on Tuesday than her opponent. But it was clear that, if she remains the front-runner for the nomination, she has yet to put to rest questions about her candidacy or put away an opponent who has proved to be more resilient and effective than most people imagined.      Wednesday’s debate settled little. Both Clinton and Sanders were effective in making their cases. Picking winners and losers seemed beside the point. From here on, the voters will decide winners and losers, week after week, in primaries and caucuses. Clinton may hold a lead in pledged delegates, but that isn’t likely to intimidate Sanders after what happened in Michigan.      At a debate hosted by The Washington Post and Univision in Miami, a Guatemalan woman whose husband was deported asked candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton what they would do reunite families. Lucia Quiej brought her five children, who haven't seen their father in three years, to the debate. (The Washington Post)      Clinton should be familiar with what awaits her in the weeks ahead. She went through this in 2008 against then-Sen. Barack Obama, but from the other side, playing the role that Sanders plays today: the dogged challenger hanging in against long odds.      Eight years ago, Obama was on the brink of ending the race for the nomination, having won 11 consecutive victories in February after Super Tuesday. One last obstacle remained: contests in Ohio and Texas in early March.      Then, Bill Clinton set his wife’s expectations almost impossibly high. He suggested that a loss in either state would knock her out of the race. The Obama team poured more than 15 million into those contests, determined to bring the race to a close.      Instead, Clinton began to find her voice — with a more populist economic message. Sound familiar? She went on to win Ohio and a popular-vote victory in the Texas primary. A dejected Obama knew instantly what the results meant. Though he had a lead in delegates that would be difficult to surmount, he realized the race would grind on interminably for three more months.      That’s the possible impact of what happened in Michigan on Tuesday. A Clinton victory could have effectively ended Sanders’s rationale for continuing, though it was doubtful he would have gotten out of the race soon. Now, though he trails in pledged delegates by a substantial margin, he has been revived, just as Clinton was eight years ago this month. This cannot be a happy moment for Clinton this week as she assesses the cost of her Michigan loss.      Sanders had been told just before Tuesday’s vote that he probably would lose narrowly. Clinton’s campaign knew it was possible, though not necessarily likely, that she could lose Michigan. The demographics played better to Sanders than other recent states. Ironically it was her ability to win white, working-class Democrats against Obama that kept her 2008 campaign going. Against Sanders on Tuesday, she lost not only whites without college degrees but also whites with college degrees.      Much of this goes to the issue of the continuing weakness in her candidacy, the issues of trust and authenticity. Asked a direct question about this in the debate, Clinton said, “I do take responsibility.” She followed that by saying, “I am not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed, unlike my husband and President Obama . . . I have to do the best I can.”      After a year of campaigning, Clinton still seems not to have found a comfortable voice or a message that comes from her heart, unlike eight years ago as she battled to overtake Obama. This came to the fore in Michigan, a trade-sensitive state, where she struggled to demonstrate that she is as resistant to trade agreements as her opponent.      Her attack on Sanders in last Sunday’s debate as an opponent of the auto bailout was a stretch at best, a deliberate distortion at worst. On Tuesday she doubled down on the issue, seeking to show that Sanders had opposed a bill early in 2009 that included funds to save the industry.      But almost immediately after she did, David Axelrod, who was senior adviser to Obama in the White House, tweeted this: “She did it again and I’ll say it again. It’s misleading to imply that TARP II was an auto bailout bill.”      The tactic was reminiscent of the campaign’s earlier claim that Sanders wanted to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and leave millions of people without health insurance — an argument that, no matter how one feels about his support for a single-payer type system, did not ring true. Sanders’s message has defined the contest and she has had to respond to it, just as she has had to adapt to a changing Democratic Party.      Clinton’s clear advantage today is the same one Obama enjoyed in 2008 after he lost Ohio and Texas. Thanks to Democratic rules of proportionality, Sanders probably will struggle to make up his deficit in delegates. That hill is even higher when Clinton’s support from elected officials and party leaders — the superdelegates — is included.      Next week will bring contests in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina. Florida and North Carolina look good for Clinton; the other three present opportunities for Sanders, though none will be easy for him. By next week at this time, if she runs the table or comes close, the conversation might have shifted again, to the reality of the delegate math.      That, however, will not deter Sanders. He sees the calendar farther ahead as increasingly favorable. He has the money and now the incentive to stay in until the end and already is eyeing big efforts in big states such as New York and California. His advisers believe he can win a series of states later in March and beyond, even if he makes much less progress in cutting down Clinton’s advantage in delegates.      Whatever transpires from here, this is not the campaign Clinton envisioned. She remains the favorite to win the nomination. Michigan did not change that. But because of that vote, she faces renewed doubts about her effectiveness as a candidate. They are many of the same ones she has been dealing with since the campaign began long ago. ||||| The Democratic race is a tangle of contradiction, paradox and pungent little ironies.      Take Hillary Clinton. Here’s a prohibitive front-runner with an allegedly bottomless reservoir of Wall Street cash who is being outspent by a guy who once professed his admiration for Fidel Castro.      Story Continued Below      Bernie Sanders, he of the orgiastic 10,000 college-kid rally, has collected a million-plus fewer votes than the ostensibly yawn-inducing Clinton. Sanders is a creature of momentum and hope whose path to the nomination is getting narrower all the time, and at Wednesday’s debate, Mr. Anti-Establishment more or less conceded he can’t win without wooing establishmentarian superdelegates.      Their latest collision — at the Univision/CNN debate in Miami on Wednesday — was suitably feisty and characteristically inconclusive. Clinton — disciplined, in denial, or a little bit of both — pretended that her back-breaking Michigan loss never happened — and Sanders made it out to be the most resounding upset since Truman beat Dewey.      “I won one of the contests and lost another close one,” said Clinton, speaking of her big win in Mississippi. “I was pleased I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates.”      Sanders said Michigan was momentous, as “one of the greatest political upsets in history.”      Nobody won, nobody lost, and everybody's hunkering down for a marathon that will last at least until April.      Here are five takeaways.      1. Slick Bernie. It’s time to look past the sartorial sloth to see the political steel in Bernard (no middle name) Sanders. There is no more disciplined candidate in the 2016 field than the 74-year-old Vermont senator — none — and a quick scan of the transcripts of recent debates reveals his metronomic recitation of succinct anti-Clinton attack phrases repeated over and over and over with deadly, aw-shucks efficiency.      No. One on the list is his call for her to release transcripts of her paid Wall Street speeches. This is his March 6 version, which was virtually identical to his Wednesday night spiel: “Secretary Clinton wanted everyone else to release it. Well, I’m your Democratic opponent, I release it. Here it is. There ain’t nothing! I don’t give speeches to Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars. You got it.”      Sanders’ message discipline allows him to engage in politically expedient character attacks that are the staple of standard-issue negative campaigning — while portraying himself as a class warrior impelled only by principle. Paradoxically, Sanders’ biggest “mistake” of the campaign — saying the American people don’t “give a damn” about Clinton’s email server — has turned out to be one of his canniest moves: The fact that he turned down a free shot at the first debate has given him a permission structure to subsequently hammer her relentlessly. Oh, and the server issue gets mentioned plenty without his help: On Wednesday night, moderator Jorge Ramos asked Clinton whether she’d drop out if she gets indicted.      2. Scattershot Hillary. The New York Times editorial board thinks Hillary Clinton is being a big meanie to Bernie Sanders, and that’s why she lost Michigan. “Even with a double-digit lead before the primary, she failed to avoid the type of negative tactics that could damage her in the long haul,” the board wrote. “If she hopes to unify Democrats as the nominee, trying to tarnish Mr. Sanders as she did in Michigan this week is not the way to go. Mrs. Clinton’s falsely parsing Mr. Sanders’s Senate vote on a 2008 recession-related bailout bill as abandoning the auto industry rescue hurt her credibility.”      Her camp says the charge is perfectly fair because Sanders voted against the only bailout bill that had a chance. Whatever. Every political professional knows that Clinton must attack Sanders to win, to defend herself against his (indirect) characterization of her as a bought-and-sold establishment hack. And no editorial board has asked him to cease his attacks on her for the sake of greater party comity and human dignity.      That said, Clinton’s recent onslaught against Sanders has an unfocused, over-the-top quality that doesn’t paint a coherent negative portrait of the man standing across the stage. It’s not a problem of excessive nastiness, it’s a question of passing the oppo-dump sniff test. The Bernie Sanders whom Clinton described on Wednesday night is a guy who once supported the Minutemen anti-immigrant movement, is a tool of the Koch brothers, a reactionary in Fidel Castro khakis who is happily helping Republicans dismantle Obamacare. He’s none of those things, actually.      There is a potentially effective and focused attack on Sanders obscured in the thicket of Clinton exaggeration: Sanders, the argument goes, is just too pure to actually govern, and he prefers casting a perfect “no” to crafting an imperfect-but-valuable compromise. As one Clinton adviser recently put it to me: “She’s easy to attack because she’s done so much. … You can’t attack Bernie ‘cause he hasn’t done a goddamned thing.”      It’s not the sexiest message — the “progressive who can get things done” argument she makes at the start of every debate — but it’s the one that most fits her candidacy and most authentically exposes Sanders’ weaknesses.      3. Clinton’s best line of the campaign. Self-deprecation is not Clinton’s default — she’s simply too proud a person — but she’s recently been adding a powerful (if painfully obvious) admission to her speeches and interviews. “I am not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed, like my husband or President Obama.”      Or Bernie Sanders.      4. Sanders fought Clinton to a draw on immigration. So far, Clinton has enjoyed a small but significant advantage among Hispanic voters (despite a disputed entrance poll that showed him winning Latinos in Nevada), echoing her strong showing with Latinos in 2008.      But Sanders isn’t conceding anything this time, despite polls showing him trailing badly in Florida. He challenged her record on immigration Wednesday, mocking her slow disavowal of an Obama administration policy that has resulted in the deportation of hundreds of Central American children. And she returned fire, accusing him of supporting legislation as a House member a decade ago that led to mass deportations, a bill she claimed was backed by Minutemen vigilante groups in Arizona.      It got under Sanders’ skin: \\"No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement and an unfair statement to make,” he said, adding: “I will match my record against yours any day of the week.”      5. Jorge Ramos cares very much about Clinton’s damn emails. Say what you want about Univision’s most famous newsman — who was infamously carried bodily from a Trump news conference for speaking out of turn — he’s an equal opportunity pest. To the dismay of the groaning, booing audience in Miami, Ramos twice pressed Clinton on the fallout from her use of a private email server as secretary of state.      The first time, he asked Clintonwhether she had imposed a double standard on her Foggy Bottom employees, demanding they use government servers while she switched over to a “homebrew” setup. She parried that one easily, rolling out her usual retort that her actions were identical to those of her predecessors, including Colin Powell.      A few minutes later, Ramos returned to the subject with a vengeance.      \\"If you get indicted, will you drop out?” he asked her, craning forward as if to dodge the cascade of disapproval welling up behind him in the crowd.      Clinton guffawed, then smiled. “Oh, for goodness — that is not going to happen. I’m not even answering that question.” ||||| The day after Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersRussian government promotes conspiracy surrounding murdered DNC staffer Bernie backers fight to take over California Democrats Charter school industry scores huge victory in Los Angeles MORE squeaked by Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonBaldwin's Trump sings 'Hallelujah' with WH advisers for SNL season finale Dem rips Trump's claim of historically unfair treatment The Memo: Trump base shows signs of cracking MORE in the Michigan primaries, the two Democratic presidential candidates engaged in a contentious debate as they ready for big-delegate states next week.

With just days until the all-important March 15 primaries, where more than 30 percent of delegates will be awarded, including in Florida, here are five things to know about Wednesday’s debate.      The Democratic Party has moved to the left on immigration      A healthy dose of immigration policy was expected during Wednesday's debate. But the candidates' posture — their agreements and their attacks against each other — showed a party that's ready to shift even further to the left than its current standard-bearer, President Obama.      Both candidates agreed to not deport any person in the U.S. illegally who has not committed any other crimes; they doubled down on pushing Obama's immigration executive actions even further and they pledged to tackle immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship as a top priority.      But Clinton hung Sanders's 2007 vote against immigration reform around his neck, casting his argument that he voted against the bill because of concerns about inhumane guest-worker policies as fiction.      \\"I think it’s very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama Barack ObamaMcMaster suggests Trump won’t say ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ in speech Trump gets royal welcome during 'tremendous' Saudi Arabia visit Why is Trump rewarding Saudi war crimes with more weapons? MORE, me, La Raza, United Farm Workers, Dolores Huerta, leaders of the Hispanic community would have supported a bill that actually promoted modern slavery,” Clinton said.      Sanders struck back by arguing that Clinton had been too conservative in coming out against driver's licenses for those in America illegally back in 2007 and that she wasn't compassionate enough when child migrants fled to America in 2014.      \\"One of the great human tragedies of recent years was when children came from Honduras, where there is probably more violence than almost every place in this country,\\" Sanders said.      \\"And I said welcome those children into this country. Secretary Clinton said send them back.”      The emphasis comes as Donald Trump Donald TrumpTom Perez: 'Donald Trump has to go' Trump's 2018 budget would slash EPA spending by 30 percent: report Are American airports really ‘third-world’ in quality? MORE continues to strengthen his grip on the Republican nomination, a reality that could drive even more Hispanics to vote for the Democrats.      Clinton and Sanders are getting under each other's skin      The Democratic debates may lack the off-color and personal barbs seen on the GOP side of the aisle, but it's becoming clear that the two Democrats are starting to get exasperated with one another.      Sunday's debate marked the most contentious one yet, and that flavor carried over into Wednesday night, with Clinton sternly rebuking Sanders with an \\"excuse me\\" when he tried to interrupt her. Sanders made a similar remark on Sunday, which resulted in boos from that debate's audience.      One flashpoint came when Clinton repeated her recent accusation that Sanders had been against the auto bailout. The Vermont senator accused her of cherrypicking pieces of his record, noting that he had supported an auto bailout but only voted against the bill because it bailed out Wall Street as well.      \\"What the secretary is doing tonight, and has done very often, is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it,\\" Sanders said, bashing her for making \\"unfair\\" and \\"horrific\\" statements.      \\"I will match my record against yours any day.\\"      Sanders has eyes on the superdelegates      Clinton leads in pledged delegates — those won by election — by 206. But with superdelegates — those who are free to support whomever they want and can change their minds at any time — Clinton’s lead rises.      Clinton has more than 460 superdelegates to Sanders' approximately 20, which, when added to her pledged delegates, has put her more than halfway to the total needed to win the nomination.      That makes it a tough hill for Sanders to climb — unless he can capture some of those superdelegates, party leaders who have overwhelmingly backed Clinton.      Aware of that reality, Sanders publicly pivoted to an appeal to the party's superdelegates.      Lauding his upset win in Michigan by noting that some have called the win one of the \\"major political upsets in modern American history,\\" Sanders pitched an optimistic message.      \\"We will continue to do extremely well, win a number of these primaries and convince superdelegates that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.\\"      Clinton is done with the email questions      Clinton faced some of her toughest questions during Wednesday's debate on the investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of State, and her answers showed she is ready to move past it.      \\"I'm not concerned about it. I'm not worried about it, and no Democrat or American should be, either,\\" she said.      When pressed by moderator Jorge Ramos about whether she'd drop out if she was indicted on the matter, Clinton refused to answer.      \\"Oh, for goodness, it's not going to happen. I'm not even answering that question,\\" she said.      The answer comes a week after a State Department staffer took an immunity deal surrounding the FBI investigation into her emails. Clinton said Sunday that she's happy to hear that the employee is cooperating.      Sanders won’t back down on Clinton’s paid speeches      Sanders believes that he’s found a weak spot for Clinton: her paid speeches to Wall Street. He has repeatedly called on her to release the transcripts of them, questioning whether she had been cozying up to Wall Street in private.      “I would think that a speech so great that you got paid so much money for, you would like to share it with the American people,” Sanders said.      When Clinton said that she had gone to the banks ahead of the financial crisis to warn them about reckless behavior, Sanders shot back sarcastically.      \\"Clearly the secretary's words to Wall Street has really intimidated [Wall Street], and that is why they have given her 15 million in campaign contributions,\\" he joked.      In response, Clinton evoked a recent ad from a group aligned with the Koch Brothers that praised his stance against the Export-Import Bank. The reminder is a particularly harsh one for Sanders, who repeatedly rails on the Koch's influence in politics. ||||| It was only three days since the last Democratic debate, but Wednesday night's showdown in Miami might as well have been a whole new race.      Since debating in Flint on Sunday night, Bernie Sanders had scored an upset victory in Michigan — a surprise win that's put Hillary Clinton on the defensive while emboldening Sanders.      Clinton, addressing the results directly, noted that she won more votes and more delegates on Tuesday (thanks to her big win in Mississippi) even as she and Sanders split the states. It was a confident and accurate portrayal of the state of the race.      But her words and actions on the debate stage betrayed a much more profound insecurity. While Sunday night she seemed confident in a message that she was sure — based on extensive polling — would deliver a clear Michigan victory on March 8, followed by clear Illinois and Ohio victories on March 15, by Wednesday night she seemed profoundly uncertain of where she stood.      Technical glitches and a shaky command of debate management from a television crew that hasn't been involved in earlier debates this cycle further added to the unsettled atmosphere, as did a rowdy and vocal crowd.      The overall effect was a debate that was not itself a transformative moment in the campaign so much as a signifier of how the campaign has been transformed once again. Clinton still holds a very solid lead, and all signs point to her winning. But nobody — including Clinton herself — is certain of how solid those signs are, and for now she's watching her back quite nervously.      Here are a few people who benefited and suffered from the fog.      Winner: Bernie Sanders      In part, Sanders simply benefited from good fortune. All three of the moderators were more focused on Clinton's weaknesses than Sanders's, and set the tone for a debate that overwhelmingly put Clinton on the defensive. The only really tough question Sanders got came very late in the debate and on an issue — his past praise of Fidel Castro and Daniel Ortega — that Democratic primary voters probably don't care about.      Still, despite a favorable landscape, Sanders executed cleanly, crisply, and clearly. He delivered multiple red meat lines that attracted thunderous applause from the audience.      Perhaps most of all, Sanders effectively pulled off the central rhetorical trick of his campaign: repeatedly making policy commitments that are well to the left of the Obama administration while downplaying the idea of a sharp break between himself and the popular incumbent president.      In Clinton's best debates, she wields President Obama as an effective human shield, forcing Sanders to tone down his fiery condemnations of Washington corruption and throwing him off his message. Wednesday night, he didn't have that problem. He slammed Clinton on her speaking fees, where she can't use Obama as a shield, and deftly made a calculated break with Obama on deportations.      Winner: Republicans      Two days ago, I expected Hillary Clinton to win Michigan handily and then take advantage of the Univision debate to begin pivoting to the center and focusing the bulk of her energy on attacking the GOP field. Tonight should have been an opportunity to pin Donald Trump down to his extreme views, to elevate the national profile of some of Ted Cruz's more hard-right positions, and to start questioning the image of John Kasich as a moderate.      Instead, Clinton narrowly lost Michigan and found herself bogged down in a real dogfight of a debate.      Both candidates directed the vast majority of their fire at each other, generating a somewhat exaggerated view of the differences between them and forgoing an opportunity to drive home an anti-Republican message. And the back and forth between Clinton and Sanders largely consisted of a relentless leftward march on every issue under the sun.      Voters alarmed by the state of the Republican field but concerned that Democrats would indulge in overtaxation and be too relaxed about government spending, too soft on crime or too weak on national security, heard absolutely nothing reassuring Wednesday night. Sanders drove home his left-wing message, and Clinton generally found herself tapping gingerly to the left rather than standing her ground.      Loser: Hillary Clinton      From the first day of the 2016 campaign right through to today, Clinton has been the favorite to win the nomination. She has had her stumbles and Sanders has had his victories, but she remains the frontrunner, and that hasn't changed. But one of her core objectives throughout this primary has been not just to win, but to win without letting herself get dragged into left-wing positions that will complicate her task in the general election.      Until tonight, she'd done a pretty good job of it.      But when hit by waves of questions that were less about comprehensive immigration reform than about enforcement of existing immigration law, she made a series of commitments that go well beyond the existing Democratic Party consensus. Clinton indicated that she wouldn't deport children, and maybe wouldn't deport anyone at all as long as they haven't violated non-immigration laws. She even went so far as to suggest she will try to help people who've already been deported come back to the United States.      The narrow political calculation here is clear enough — Clinton needs nonwhite voters to win the primary, and most general election voters probably don't care too much about this. But the net effect is to dull the sense that Donald Trump has an extreme position on immigration by countering \\"deport everyone\\" with \\"deport almost nobody.\\"      Video: The audience booed for eight straight seconds when Hillary Clinton was asked about Benghazi      Loser: Univision      This debate was a mess, starting with the fact that Sanders's microphone didn't work at the beginning through to disastrous audio mixing on the simultaneous translation that often left neither the Spanish nor English audible.      But the problems went well beyond technical issues. The moderators opened the debate with two process questions in a row, and repeatedly went back to the well of faux hardball questions rather than illuminating ones.      Not all the questions were bad, though, and the debate featured many intriguing exchanges. Yet each time an argument was getting good, the moderators would butt in to declare that time was up and we needed to move on to a different subject.      Given the one-on-one nature of the debate, there was simply no need for this. Disagreements between Clinton and Sanders over the wisdom of single-payer health care, over the merits of the 2007 immigration reform bill, over the Export-Import Bank, and a half-dozen other issues ended up being cut short in favor of pivots to often-useless questions about email servers or Benghazi. The result was, on most issues, something more like a side-by-side display of talking points than a real debate.      Loser: Voters who care about immigration      Immigration policy hasn't been central to the 2016 Democratic campaign, and a debate co-hosted by Univision was a perfect opportunity to dive deeper into the topic and get a clearer view of where the candidates stand. As you might expect, we got quite a few questions on immigration. But those questions produced surprisingly little actual clarity on the policy issues or the choices facing the candidates.      Clinton and Sanders, for example, rehearsed a now-familiar dialogue in which she slams him for having opposed the bipartisan 2007 immigration reform bill, after which Sanders explains he opposed it because it expanded guest worker programs that he regards as \\"akin to slavery.\\"      Does that mean Sanders wants to eliminate these programs? Given that the US has several different classes of guest-worker visas, which ones specifically does he have a problem with? Does Clinton agree with his criticisms of them, even if they reached different conclusions about the merits of the 2007 law? Do the candidates think the current level of immigration to the United States is appropriate? Too high? Too low? What do they make of the rising anti-immigration sentiment in the Republican Party, and how does that change their thinking about the path forward for legislation?      These weedsier questions about immigration are unlikely to be aired in any other forum, and it would have been great to take the time to delve into them rather than spending so much time rehashing questions that have been debated time and again.

By making sure to take the meat out of the freezer well ahead of time, Sasha demonstrates a level of thoughtfulness and planning that is characteristic of someone who is well-organized. Being organized means that Sasha is able to effectively coordinate and manage tasks, resources, and time in an orderly manner. Furthermore, Sasha's proactive behavior demonstrates efficiency as well. Efficiency is all about achieving a goal or completing a task with the least amount of resources required. In this case, Sasha's early action of taking out the meat from the freezer ensures that it will be properly thawed and ready to be cooked when needed, thereby avoiding any delays or last-minute stress that may arise from not having the necessary ingredients prepared beforehand. Taking into account both organization and efficiency, it is evident that Sasha's actions showcase a person who is attentive to details, follows a well-structured approach, and aims to accomplish tasks in the most effective way possible. This allows Sasha to stay on top of things and maintain a sense of control over various responsibilities, ultimately leading to increased productivity and success both in everyday tasks and more complex endeavors. In contrast, disorganized and messy individuals often struggle with managing their time and resources effectively, and may find themselves overwhelmed or ill-prepared in various situations.

This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time.

Odissi (Odia: odd'ishii Odisi), also referred to as Orissi in older literature, is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples of Odisha - an eastern coastal state of India. Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women, and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism (Vishnu as Jagannath). Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses (Shaktism). The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of Odissi Hindu temples, and archeological sites related to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The Buddhist, Jain and Hindu archaeological sites in Odisha state, particularly the Assia range of hills show inscriptions and carvings of dances that are dated to the 6th to 9th century CE. Important sites include the Ranigumpha in Udaygiri, and various caves and temples at Lalitgiri, Ratnagiri and Alatgiri sites. The Buddhist icons, for example, are depicted as dancing gods and goddesses, with Haruka, Vajravarahi, and Marichi in Odissi-like postures. Historical evidence, states Alexandra Carter, shows that Odissi Maharis (Hindu temple dancers) and dance halls architecture (nata-mandap) were in vogue at least by the 9th century CE.  According to Kapila Vatsyayan, the Kalpasutra of Jainism, in its manuscripts discovered in Gujarat, includes classical Indian dance poses - such as the Samapada, the Tribhangi and the Chuaka of Odissi. This, states Vatsyayan, suggests that Odissi was admired or at least well known in distant parts of India, far from Odisha in the medieval era, to be included in the margins of an important Jain text. However, the Jain manuscripts use the dance poses as decorative art in the margins and cover, but do not describe or discuss the dance. Hindu dance texts such as the Abhinaya Chandrika and Abhinaya Darpana provide a detailed description of the movements of the feet, hands, the standing postures, the movement and the dance repertoire. It includes illustrations of the Karanas mentioned in NatyaShastra. Similarly, the illustrated Hindu text on temple architecture from Odisha, the Shilpaprakasha, deals with Odia architecture and sculpture, and includes Odissi postures.  Actual sculptures that have survived into the modern era and panel reliefs in Odia temples, dated to be from the 10th to 14th century, show Odissi dance. This is evidenced in Jagannath temple in Puri, as well as other temples of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Vedic deities such as Surya (Sun) in Odisha. There are several sculptures of dancers and musicians in Konark Sun Temple and Brahmeswara Temple in Bhubaneswar.

Paragraph: Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me.

He was the first child of the journalist Robert Mortimer Wheeler and his second wife Emily Wheeler (née Baynes). The son of a tea merchant based in Bristol, in youth Robert had considered becoming a Baptist minister, but instead became a staunch freethinker while studying at the University of Edinburgh. Initially working as a lecturer in English literature Robert turned to journalism after his first wife died in childbirth. His second wife, Emily, shared her husband's interest in English literature, and was the niece of Thomas Spencer Baynes, a Shakespearean scholar at St. Andrews University. Their marriage was emotionally strained, a situation exacerbated by their financial insecurity. Within two years of their son's birth, the family moved to Edinburgh, where a daughter named Amy was born. The couple gave their two children nicknames, with Mortimer being \\"Boberic\\" and Amy being \\"Totsy\\". When Wheeler was four, his father was appointed chief leader writer for the Bradford Observer. The family relocated to Saltaire, a village northwest of Bradford, a cosmopolitan city in Yorkshire, northeast England,  which was then in the midst of the wool trade boom. Wheeler was inspired by the moors surrounding Saltaire and fascinated by the area's archaeology. He later wrote about discovering a late prehistoric cup-marked stone, searching for lithics on Ilkley Moor, and digging into a barrow on Baildon Moor. Although suffering from ill health, Emily Wheeler taught her two children with the help of a maid up to the age of seven or eight. Mortimer remained emotionally distant from his mother, instead being far closer to his father, whose company he favoured over that of other children.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. Question: Who was angry as the bus rode on?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Rudolf Joseph Lorenz Steiner (27 (or 25) February 1861 - 30 March 1925) was an Austrian philosopher, social reformer, architect and esotericist. Steiner gained initial recognition at the end of the nineteenth century as a literary critic and published philosophical works including The Philosophy of Freedom. At the beginning of the twentieth century he founded an esoteric spiritual movement, anthroposophy, with roots in German idealist philosophy and theosophy; other influences include Goethean science and Rosicrucianism. In the first, more philosophically oriented phase of this movement, Steiner attempted to find a synthesis between science and spirituality. The Anthroposophical Society grew rapidly. Fueled by a need to find an artistic home for their yearly conferences, which included performances of plays written by Edouard Schure and Steiner, the decision was made to build a theater and organizational center. In 1913, construction began on the first Goetheanum building, in Dornach, Switzerland. The building, designed by Steiner, was built to a significant part by volunteers who offered craftsmanship or simply a will to learn new skills. Once World War I started in 1914, the Goetheanum volunteers could hear the sound of cannon fire beyond the Swiss border, but despite the war, people from all over Europe worked peaceably side by side on the building's construction.  Steiner's lecture activity expanded enormously with the end of the war. Most importantly, from 1919 on Steiner began to work with other members of the society to found numerous practical institutions and activities, including the first Waldorf school, founded that year in Stuttgart, Germany. At the same time, the Goetheanum developed as a wide-ranging cultural centre. On New Year's Eve, 1922/1923, the building burned to the ground; contemporary police reports indicate arson as the probable cause. Steiner immediately began work designing a second Goetheanum building - this time made of concrete instead of wood - which was completed in 1928, three years after his death.  At a \\"Foundation Meeting\\" for members held at the Dornach center during Christmas, 1923, Steiner spoke of laying a new Foundation Stone for the society in the hearts of his listeners. At the meeting, a new \\"General Anthroposophical Society\\" was established with a new executive board. At this meeting, Steiner also founded a School of Spiritual Science, intended as an \\"organ of initiative\\" for research and study and as \\"the 'soul' of the Anthroposophical Society\\". This School, which was led by Steiner, initially had sections for general anthroposophy, education, medicine, performing arts (eurythmy, speech, drama and music), the literary arts and humanities, mathematics, astronomy, science, and visual arts. Later sections were added for the social sciences, youth and agriculture. The School of Spiritual Science included meditative exercises given by Steiner. When was the second one completed?","output":"The second building, which was also known as the second Goetheanum, was completed in 1928. This was three years after Rudolf Steiner, the person who designed it, had passed away."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Robert Lee \\"Bullet Bob\\" Hayes (December 20, 1942 - September 18, 2002) was an Olympic sprinter turned American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys. An American track and field athlete, he was a two-sport stand-out in college in both track and football at Florida A&M University. He has one of the top 100 meter times by NFL players. Hayes was enshrined in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2001 and was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January 2009. At the 1964 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Hayes had his finest hour as a sprinter. First, he won the 100m and in doing so tied the then world record in the 100 m with a time of 10.06 seconds, even though he was running in lane 1 which had, the day before, been used for the 20 km racewalk and this badly chewed up the cinder track. He also was running in borrowed spikes because one of his shoes had been kicked under the bed when he was playing with some friends and he didn't realize until he got there. This was followed by a second gold medal in the 4x100 meter relay, which also produced a new World Record (39.06 seconds).  His come-from-behind win for the US team in the relay was one of the most memorable Olympic moments. Hand-timed between 8.5 and 8.9 seconds, his relay leg is the fastest in history. Jocelyn Delecour, France's anchor leg runner, famously said to Paul Drayton before the relay final that, \\"You can't win, all you have is Bob Hayes.\\" Drayton was able to reply afterwards, \\"That's all we need.\\" The race was also Hayes' last as a track and field athlete, as he permanently switched to football after it, aged only 21.  In some of the first meets to be timed with experimental fully automatic timing, Hayes was the first man to break ten seconds for the 100 meters, albeit with a 5.3 m/s wind assistance in the semi-finals of the 1964 Olympics. His time was recorded at 9.91 seconds. Jim Hines officially broke 10 seconds at the high altitude of Mexico City, Mexico in 1968 (and on a synthetic track) with a wind legal 9.95 which stood as the world record for almost 15 years. The next to surpass Hayes at a low altitude Olympics was Carl Lewis in 1984 when he won in 9.99, some 20 years later (though Hasely Crawford equaled the time in 1976).  Until the Tokyo Olympics, world records were measured by officials with stopwatches, measured to the nearest tenth of a second. Although fully automatic timing was used in Tokyo, the times were given the appearance of manual timing. This was done by subtracting 0.05 seconds from the automatic time and rounding to the nearest tenth of a second, making Hayes' time of 10.06 seconds convert to 10.0 seconds, despite the fact that the officials with stopwatches had measured Hayes' time to be 9.9 seconds, and the average difference between manual and automatic times was typically 0.15 to 0.20 seconds. This unique method of determining the official time therefore denied Hayes the record of being the first to officially record 9.9 seconds for the 100 meters. The first official times of 9.9 seconds were recorded at the \\"Night of Speed\\" in 1968. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Of course, little buddy! There are a lot of cool things about Bob Hayes mentioned in the article. This guy was super fast, like a superhero. One of the amazing parts was when he won two gold medals at the Olympics in 1964. He won one for running really, really fast alone (in the 100m race), and another one for running really, really fast with a team (in the 4x100 meter relay). He ran so fast that he tied the world record at that time! He also ran the fastest relay leg ever, which is like if your team is far behind in a race, but then you come in and run so fast that you still win. It's like in a cartoon when the roadrunner speeds away from the coyote. That was amazing! But the funny and surprising part is that he won that 100m race even though he was wearing someone else's shoes, because he lost his own. Just imagine, little buddy, how fast he could have been with his own shoes!   Then he left the running scene and joined football, where he also became a star. So, in a way, Bob was like a superman excelling in more than just one sport! Oh, and he's part of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, where only the greatest football players get to be.

It can be hard to maintain the same work hours every day when you work from home, but maintaining regular work hours can help you to keep your work and home life separate. Choose realistic work hours and stick to them. For example, you might decide to work from 8:00am to 4:30pm on Monday through Friday.  Don’t let your work hours creep into your personal time. When it is time to stop for the day, stop working, shut down your laptop, and step away from your work space. Try to set work hours that work with your personal life. For example, try to avoid working on the weekends if you know that there are things you will want to do. Change into work clothes in the morning and non-work clothes in the evening. Rolling out of bed and going straight to your workspace in your pajamas will make it harder for you to transition into your workday. The same thing goes for wearing your work clothes into the evening.  Try getting up about 30 to 60 minutes before you want to start working for the day so that you can get dressed for work. Make sure that you change out of your work clothes when it is time to relax. For example, you can switch to pajamas or your favorite jeans and a t-shirt. When you work at an office, taking a lunch break is necessary and you may even have someone else reminding you to take one. However, when you work from home, it can be hard to remember to take lunch breaks and you may be tempted to work through your lunch or eat at your workspace. Instead, make lunch breaks a mandatory part of your day.  Set a time for your lunch break to start and end every day. For example, you might agree to take lunch from 12:00 to 12:30 each day. Ask a family member or significant other to remind you when it is time for your lunch break. If you are worried about forgetting to take a lunch break, then ask one of your friends or family members to come get you when it is time for a break. You may be tempted to do things around your house while you are taking a quick break or making a work phone call, but this can blur the dividing line between work and home.  Try to prevent yourself from doing any housework or anything that is not work related while you are on the clock. If you notice a household chore that you want to complete, write it down on a notepad and save it for the end of your work day. Keep in mind that everyone is different. For example, if you find that folding laundry is a soothing way for you to spend a break, then go for it! Finding a simple way to reward yourself for a hard day of work is also important. You can reward yourself with a walk outside, a cup of tea, a chat with a friend, or any other pleasant activity that indicates your work day is over. Consider doing something social at the end of each day. Working from home can be isolating, so it is important for you to find ways to interact with other people. You can do this by talking to your significant other, meeting up with some friends for coffee, or taking an aerobics class after work.","output":"Maintaining regular work hours while working from home can help separate professional and personal life by setting realistic work schedules, changing into and out of work clothes, taking mandatory lunch breaks, avoiding house chores during work hours, and socializing after work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Greek debt crisis: Tsipras vows not to 'abandon ship'; IMF urges massive debt relief - as it happened Even if you think Alexis Tsipras has misplayed the crisis, it’s hard not to be impressed by his composure in tonight’s interview. Barely 36 hours after agreeing the punitive bailout deal with fellow eurozone leaders, the Greek PM has given a solid defense of the agreement he brought back from Brussels. He was scathing about the tactics played by his opponents, declaring: “Last night was a bad night for Europe.” and adding that the events last weekend “does not honour the tradition of a democratic Europe”. He repeated his claim that, by calling a referendum, he had ended up with a better deal that addresses Greece’s medium-term funding needs. And, eventually, debt relief. “To be frank, here, they [eurozone countries] are not only forced to give fresh money, but to give 82 billion, and are accepting the restructure of debt.” However, there was no pretense that he’d played a blinder in Brussels. Tsipras even admitted that he didn’t believe in the plan forced on Greece - but he’d do his best to implement it. “I am fully assuming my responsibilities, for mistakes and for oversights, and for the responsibility of signing a text that I do not believe in, but that I am obliged to implement,” There were signs that Tsipras was still digesting the impact of his all-night battles with his eurozone neighbours, as he said bitterly that: “The hard truth is this one-way street for Greece was imposed on us,” That #Tsipras spoke of #Greece suffering post-traumatic stress at moment says all you need to know about what kind of w/e he had #Greece On Grexit, he warned that the risk hadn’t totally vanished, until the bailout deal has been ratified. But he was adamant that the country didn’t have the resources to cope outside the eurozone. And he claimed that some conservative groups would be keen to see Syriza out on their collective ear. The bruises from the Euro summit may never really heal. He didn’t dump the blame for the crisis on Yanis Varoufakis -- his former finance minister was a great economist; that doesn’t always translate into political skills, though. But perhaps most importantly, Tsipras vowed to fight on and take hard decisions. “The worst thing a captain could do while he is steering a ship during a storm, as difficult as it is, would be to abandon the helm.” We’ll find out on Wednesday night whether Cap’n Alexis has the support of the crew, when Syriza are asked to vote on the tough austerity and radical economic reforms demanded by creditors.

Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The answer to your question \\"Which one is part of genome, mRNAs or genes?\\" is genes.  The genome of an organism is the complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. Genes carry information to make proteins. Each DNA sequence that constitutes a gene tells the cell how to construct a protein. This information is then transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules by the process of transcription for protein synthesis in a process known as translation. The paragraph you're referring to discusses the development of understanding in genetics. Initially, it was thought that one gene makes one protein. However, this has been further understood that one gene can make multiple proteins due to a process called alternative splicing. Additionally, there are coding sequences scattered in short sections across the genome, and their mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.  However, whether considering the initial model or the expanded understanding of gene function, in both cases, it is genes that are considered a part of the genome, not mRNAs. mRNAs are products of genes in action, carrying the genetic code for proteins from the DNA in the nucleus to the ribosomes where proteins are synthesized, but they are not part of the genome itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: 1). no 2). yes...I think the answer is","output":"2). Yes, both sentences essentially convey the same meaning, although they use slightly different phrasing and wording. I will provide a detailed comparison for both sentences which will demonstrate their similarities and how the information is being conveyed. Sentence 1: He was sentenced to five years in prison at Kingston Crown Court yesterday after pleading guilty to the attempted abduction of a teenager. Sentence 2: Former postal worker, Douglas Lindsell, was sentenced yesterday at Kingston Crown Court after pleading guilty to attempting to abduct a young girl. First, let's focus on the key elements in both sentences: a) Sentencing: In both sentences, the subject is being sentenced.    - Sentence 1: \\"He was sentenced to five years in prison\\" directly states the sentence.    - Sentence 2: \\"Douglas Lindsell, was sentenced yesterday\\" leaves out the duration of the sentence, but it still communicates that the person was sentenced. b) Location and date of sentencing: Both sentences indicate that the sentencing took place at the Kingston Crown Court.    - Sentence 1: \\"at Kingston Crown Court yesterday\\"    - Sentence 2: \\"yesterday at Kingston Crown Court\\" c) Plea: Both sentences describe the subject pleading guilty.    - Sentence 1: \\"after pleading guilty to the attempted abduction\\"    - Sentence 2: \\"after pleading guilty to attempting to abduct\\" d) Crime details: Although the phrasing differs slightly, it's clear the crime mentioned in both sentences is the attempted abduction of a young person.    - Sentence 1: \\"attempted abduction of a teenager\\"    - Sentence 2: \\"attempting to abduct a young girl\\" While the two sentences have slightly different styles and wording, their core message is the same: A person was sentenced to prison at Kingston Crown Court after pleading guilty to attempting to abduct a young person. The only discrepancies are that the first sentence does not provide the name of the person but specifies the sentence duration (\\"five years in prison\\"), while the second sentence provides the name (\\"Douglas Lindsell\\") and his previous occupation (\\"Former postal worker\\"), but does not mention the duration of the prison sentence. However, both sentences revolve around the same central event and thus mean the same thing. Therefore, the answer is 2). Yes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. AP      (updated below - Update II)      The New York Times' Tom Friedman, who did as much as any single individual to persuade large numbers of Democrats and \\"moderates\\" to support the invasion of Iraq, today writes:      Former President George W. Bush’s gut instinct that this region craved and needed democracy was always right. It should have and could have been pursued with much better planning and execution. This war has been extraordinarily painful and costly. But democracy was never going to have a virgin birth in a place like Iraq, which has never known any such thing. Some argue that nothing that happens in Iraq will ever justify the costs. Historians will sort that out. Personally, at this stage, I only care about one thing: that the outcome in Iraq be positive enough and forward-looking enough that those who have actually paid the price -- in lost loved ones or injured bodies, in broken homes or broken lives, be they Iraqis or Americans or Brits -- see Iraq evolve into something that will enable them to say that whatever the cost, it has given freedom and decent government to people who had none.      Sure, the war that I helped sell and cheered on led to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings (at least), the long-term displacement of millions more, and the complete destruction of another country that had done nothing to us. But I'm not interested in clouding my mind with any of that. I don't care about that. That can be talked about once I'm dead. After all, as the great humanitarian Joseph Stalin taught us, you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, and as the great scholar and torturer Condoleezza Rice explained, we should just gently shut our eyes and think about the massive slaughter and destruction we caused in that country as mere \\"birth pangs\\" on the road to something beautiful.      Back in 2003, I said -- with bloodthirsty sadism rabidly drooling from my mouth -- that the real purpose of the war, what made it the Right Thing to do, was that we needed to make large numbers of Muslims \\"suck. on. this\\" in order to show them we mean business, and we randomly picked Iraq because . . . . we could. But now -- to justify the enormous amounts of blood I helped spill and the incalculable amounts of human suffering I helped spawn -- I'm going to pretend that I was motivated by a magnanimous, noble desire to Spread Freedom.      It was only a matter of time before American elites abandoned their faux regret over Iraq. For tribalists and nationalists, America can err in its execution but never in its motives. There's no question -- as this glorifying, propagandistic Newsweek cover story reflects -- that it's now official dogma that this was the right thing to do, or at least that we produced something great and wonderful for that country, as was our intent all along (leaving aside the what is actually happening in Iraq). It's nothing short of nauseating to watch those responsible glorify what they did without weighing -- or, in Friedman's case, affirmatively dismissing as irrelevant -- the extreme amounts of death and suffering that they caused, all based on false pretenses. But this is why Tom Friedman is the favorite propagandist of \\"Washington insiders\\"-- because he feeds them the justifications they need to feel good about themselves. Forget all those innocent dead people and destruction you caused; it all worked out in the end.      UPDATE : Several people argue in Comments that this effort to portray the invasion of Iraq as a good thing is motivated not only by a desire for self-cleansing on the part of those responsible, but also to enable future, similar wars to take place. I don't know whether that's the motive, but it's definitely the effect. That the invasion of Iraq has been so widely perceived as a horrific debacle had the effect of minimizing the likelihood of future invasions. Having it now depicted as something that worked out and produced Great Results necessarily makes it easier to justify future wars in that region. After all, if attacking and invading Muslim countries we don't like in order to change their government is the good and right thing to do, shouldn't we keep doing it? ||||| I’m going to make a prediction: historians are not going to look kindly on the U.S. war in Iraq.      First, a brief digression.      Most major foreign policy writers in the U.S. decided to support the Iraq war. Most came to regret that decision, spending the next few years in print hemming and hawing and self-reflecting and criticizing the Bush administration’s incompetence. (As if Bush’s lack of brilliance should have come as a surprise–they must have missed the first nine episodes of “That’s My Bush!”)      Very few media big wigs admitted the obvious: they supported the Iraq war because they got caught up in a phenomenon called ‘war fever,’ seen in most conflicts throughout history, and as members of the media, obligingly went along with the state’s desire to invade Iraq. In other words, everyone was doing it.      But, in general, these media types are pretty vain people, and they think they’re pretty smart. Some of them are pretty smart, brilliant even. It would be an affront to their intellectual vanity to admit that they just got caught up in a particularly virulent mob mentality. That they’d been willing dupes. On the whole their reaction–rather than to take responsibility and admit the idea was obviously silly, undemocratic, and unjustified–has been to place the blame elsewhere. Paul Bremmer, George Bush, Ahmed Chalabi, Tommy Franks, George Tenet, Donald Rumsfeld etc.      After the primary reason for the war turned out to be a hoax (WMD), and with it the debunking of the corollary reason for the war (fight the terrorists over there so we don’t have to fight them at home), they were stuck with that last powerful justification, bringing freedom to the Iraqi people.      It’s always a persuasive and powerful argument: making the world safe for democracy and civilization has historically been a component of most cases for war that the U.S. has made. The argument also resurfaces each election that Iraq has had. The pictures of the purple fingers, and the euphoria that many Iraqis feel on voting day–at least they’re getting something out of the shit show they’ve had to live through–are hard to argue against. They appeal to an emotional, gut response, confirming to the American public that see, we’re the good guys after all. The election on Sunday was no exception.      Now that Americans are no longer dying in Iraq–only Iraqis are dying in Iraq–those thinkers who supported the war then turned against the war are now slowly reclaiming their earlier positions. This admittedly weasel-like behavior is to be expected of columnists, I suppose, but I have to say that I have a lot more respect for the readable assholes like Christopher Hitchens and even a Richard Perle, who at least have had the courage to stand by their misguided ideas through the worst of it.      Anyway.      Rarely do foreign policy writers acknowledge their support of the war, or their complicity in promoting it. Nowadays, they don’t even have the guts to say they were right. What they do say–and I’ve seen it a bunch–is that history will be the judge, or some version of that line. Very vocal Iraq War supporter Thomas Friedman gives us an example of this in his column today, writing:      Some argue that nothing that happens in Iraq will ever justify the costs. Historians will sort that out.      Yes, some do argue that, and I am one of them. Let the historians sort that out, as they have sorted out other imperial and colonial wars, like the French in Algeria and Indochina, the British in Baghdad, the Belgians in the Congo, the Russians in Kabul, the Japanese in Nanking and, of course, the Americans in Vietnam, to name just a few.      But humor me for a second as I quote myself. Here’s what I wrote last week before the election.      Expect, too, a rash of commentary and columns from once-upon-a time war supporters who are now quietly taking the first tentative steps to reclaim their original positions. (Subtext: The war was um,er,uh, horrible and everything, but we were right after all…)      Let’s go back to Friedman’s column. He writes:      Former President George W. Bush’s gut instinct that this region craved and needed democracy was always right. It should have and could have been pursued with much better planning and execution. This war has been extraordinarily painful and costly. But democracy was never going to have a virgin birth in a place like Iraq, which has never known any such thing.      Clearly, I’m like the Minority Report of bad Iraq columns. I could poke a few holes in his argument–might there not have been a peaceful and less costly ways to bring democracy to the Middle East, perhaps, say, by putting pressure on our autocratic allies like Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States before using the “long bomb” option on Iraq?–but I guess I’d just like to quote him one more time.      Personally, at this stage, I only care about one thing: that the outcome in Iraq be positive enough and forward-looking enough that those who have actually paid the price — in lost loved ones or injured bodies, in broken homes or broken lives, be they Iraqis or Americans or Brits — see Iraq evolve into something that will enable them to say that whatever the cost, it has given freedom and decent government to people who had none.      Like Friedman, I too hope that one day Iraq will be a positive and a peaceful place. But I am now going to take on the mantle of someone who has had friends and family and loved ones pay that price. I don’t do this very often. It’s an emotional case I’m about to make, not one based on a rational argument.      ‘Whatever the cost.’I know the cost. It’s never going to be worth it. No need to wait for the historians to figure that one out. ||||| Of all the pictures I saw from the Iraqi elections last weekend, my favorite was on nytimes.com: an Iraqi expatriate mother, voting in Michigan, holding up her son to let him stuff her ballot into the box. I loved that picture. Being able to freely cast a ballot for the candidate of your choice is still unusual for Iraqis and for that entire region. That mother seemed to be saying: When I was a child, I never got to vote. I want to live in a world where my child will always be able to.      God bless her. This was a very good day for Iraq.      To say that mere voting or an election or two makes Iraq a success story would obviously be mistaken. An election does not a democracy make — and Iraq’s politicians still have yet to prove that they are up to governing, nation-building and both establishing and abiding by the rule of law. But this election is a big deal because Iraqis — with the help of the U.N., the U.S. military and the Obama team, particularly Vice President Joe Biden — overcame two huge obstacles.      They overcame an array of sectarian disputes that repeatedly threatened to derail this election. And they came out to vote — Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds — despite the bombs set off by Al Qaeda and the dead-end Baathists who desperately want to keep the democracy project in Iraq from succeeding. This latter point is particularly crucial. The only way Al Qaeda, Baathism and violent Islamism will truly be defeated is when Arabs and Muslims themselves — not us — show they are willing to fight and die for a more democratic, tolerant and progressive future. Al Qaeda desperately wanted the U.S. project in Iraq to fail, but the Iraqi people just keep on keeping it alive.

Wade, according to new government figures released Wednesday.      In 2015, the most recent year for which data is available, a total of 638,169 abortions were reported, a decrease of 2 percent from 652,639 abortions in 2014. The abortion rate was 11.8 abortions per 1,000 women ages 15-44 in 2015, compared with 12.1 in 2014 and 15.9 in 2006.      In the years immediately after abortion was legalized nationwide in 1973, the number of legal abortions rose dramatically, reaching its peak in the 1980s. Abortions then began dropping at a slow rate until around 2006 to 2008, when they increased slightly, followed by even greater decreases in recent years.      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance report comes at a heated time for abortion politics in the country, with Trump administration officials introducing new policies to reduce funding to abortion providers and state legislatures debating ever more restrictive laws on abortion. Just this week, a federal court in Mississippi blocked the state’s ban against abortions past 15 weeks gestation. In signing the bill into law, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) had said he hoped to make the state the “safest place in America for an unborn child.”      While the CDC paper did not delve into the reasons for the decline, analysts have cited improved access to birth control, which has led to a decrease in unintended pregnancies, especially among teens, as well as the state laws regarding parental consent, waiting periods and other conditions that make it more difficult for women to get abortions.      \\"Analyses have suggested that improved contraceptive use played a role in the long-term declines. In some states, decreased access to abortion services contributed, as well,” said Rachel Jones, principal research scientist for the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports women’s right to abortion.            Abortion Surveillance - United States 2015, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention      Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion, added other possible causes: “a higher percentage of women today decide to carry an unexpected pregnancy to term, teenagers are less sexually active and with fewer partners, pro-life views are more prevalent among the rising generation than they were 40 years ago.”      He called the decline “sharp and consistent” and pointed out that the U.S. abortion rate is half of what it was in 1980.      The data is isn’t 100 percent complete — California, Maryland and New Hampshire did not participate, and the reporting is better in some places than others — but it nonetheless provides a window into the overall trends and demographics of who is seeking abortions. The report shows tremendous variation by age, race and geographic region.      While the abortion rate decreased across all age groups in 2015, women in their 20s accounted for nearly 60 percent of all abortions. The abortion rate was 19.9 for women ages 20-24 and 17.9 for ages 25-29.      White women had the lowest abortion rate, at 6.8 abortions per 1,000 women, and black women had the highest abortion rate at 25.1 per 1,000. “The findings in this report indicate that the number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions have declined across all race/ethnicity groups but that well-documented disparities persist,” Tara C. Jatlaoui, from the CDC’s division of reproductive health, and co-authors wrote.      There was also considerable variation among jurisdictions, from a rate of 2.8 abortions in South Dakota to 23.1 abortions in New York.      One major source of controversy in recent years has been the widespread availability of medical abortions or pills such as RU-486 that can be taken to induce abortion without surgical intervention. In 2015, about a quarter of all abortions involved medical abortion, which can be done only early in a pregnancy.      The report did not have information about deaths from complications of abortion in 2015, saying the data was still being assessed. In 2014, six women died as a result of legal induced abortion. ||||| (CNN) Abortion rates in the United States have dropped to their lowest level in 10 years, according to a report released Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.      From 2006 to 2015, the year of the latest completed survey , reported abortions from participating areas fell 24%, from 842,855 to 638,169.      Going back to 1969, the CDC has completed its \\"abortion surveillance\\" to measure the number and characteristics of women who obtain legal abortions. Requests for information go out to the central health agencies in all 50 states, plus Washington and New York City. The most recent surveillance included voluntary abortion data from 49 areas, the exceptions being California, Maryland and New Hampshire.      What researchers found was a striking decrease from where abortion rates were a decade ago. In addition to the steep drop in the number of reported abortions, the rates fell in two other categories. The number of abortions among women 15-44 went down 26%, from 15.9 to 11.8 abortions per 1,000 women. And the number of abortions per 1,000 live births went down by 19%, from 233 to 188.      Compared with the previous year, 2014, there was a 2% decrease in abortions across the three measures.      Because reporting is voluntary and requirements for reporting vary across the country, the CDC acknowledges that the findings have limitations. The number of abortions reported to the CDC, for example, is 68% to 71% of the number established in a census of abortion providers by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy group focused on reproductive health and rights, the report says.      But still, the findings offer significant insights into how abortion is trending in the United States.      \\"The new CDC report shows a continuation of long-term declines in abortions,\\" said Rachel Jones, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute. \\"Analyses have suggested that improved contraceptive use played a role... In some states, decreased access to abortion services contributed as well.\\"      Who's getting abortions      The majority of women who had abortions in 2015 were in their 20s; 31.1% were aged 20-24 and 27.6% were aged 25-29.      While decreases in abortion rates were seen across all age groups, the greatest decline over the decade was seen in adolescents. The rate of abortions in those aged 15-19 fell 54% between 2006 and 2015, the report shows.      More than 59% of those who had abortions in 2015 were women who'd given birth before. More than 14% were women who'd had three or more births.      A large percentage of women who had abortions in 2015 had had abortions before, according to the latest study. Nearly 44% had had one or more previous abortions; more than 8% had had three or more.      Based on areas that reported race and ethnicity data, the largest percentages of abortions in 2015 were had by non-Hispanic white women (36.9%) and non-Hispanic black women (36%). Hispanic women accounted for 18.5% of all abortions in 2015, while non-Hispanic women of other races made up 8.7%.      When and how are they getting abortions      Nearly two-thirds of all abortions in 2015 were performed at no later than eight weeks of gestation. More than 91% of abortions happened at 13 weeks or less of gestation.      Over the decade surveyed, the percentage of abortions performed at 13 weeks or more remained low, staying at 9% or less. And the percentage of earlier abortions increased, with those occurring at six weeks or less going up by 11%.      Early medical abortion, a nonsurgical abortion at 8 weeks or less gestation, accounted for nearly 25% of abortions in 2015. Of those that were eligible for this method, which uses medications, nearly 36% of women opted for this approach.      More than 64% of abortions were performed surgically at 13 or less weeks' gestation. About 9% were performed surgically after 13 weeks' gestation.      The implications      Surveillance of legal abortions in the US helps \\"to guide and evaluate the success of programs aimed at preventing unintended pregnancies,\\" the report says.      According to the most recent study, unintended pregnancies in the United States have gone down from 51% in 2008 to 45% in 2011-2013.      The rate of abortions can be influenced by a number of factors, the report shows, including availability of contraception, information and health care; access to abortion providers; changes in laws; and shifts in the economy and in attitudes about things like nonmarital childbearing.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that statistics for 2015, the most recent year for which data is available, show the abortion rate was 11.8 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44. That is down 26 percent from 2006, when the study began and the rate was 15.9 abortions per 1,000 women.      Teens aged 15 to 19 experienced a greater decrease than older women, with the rate falling 54 percent from 2006 to 2015, the CDC said.      “This decrease in abortion rate was greater than the decreases for women in any older age group,” the CDC said in a statement.      The CDC did not provide any reason for the decline, but abortion rights advocates attributed it to increased use of contraceptives as well as decreased access to abortion services in some states.      “Affordable access to the full range of contraception and family planning options is critical for people deciding if and when they’d like to become parents, develop their careers, plan for their futures and manage their health,” said Rachel Jones, research scientist at Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank that supports abortion rights.      Opponents of abortion rights said the decrease was primarily the result of many states’ efforts to restrict women’s access to the procedure.      “That is due, in a significant way, to pro-life legislation that seeks to provide life-affirming solutions to abortion, combined with pro-life efforts that educate Americans about the effects of abortion and the humanity of the unborn child,” Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said in an email.      The total number of reported abortions fell to 638,169 in 2015, from 842,855 in 2006, a 24 percent decrease. In 2015, there were 188 abortions per 1,000 live births, compared with 233 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2006, a drop of 19 percent.      In 2015, all measures reached their lowest level for the entire period of analysis from 2006 to 2015, the CDC said of the annual study, “Abortion Surveillance - United States 2015.”      Conservative state lawmakers are passing increasingly restrictive abortion laws in a challenge to Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 landmark decision that established that women have a constitutional right to an abortion.      An exam room at the Planned Parenthood South Austin Health Center is shown in Austin, Texas, U.S. June 27, 2016. REUTERS/Ilana Panich-Linsman      The Republican-controlled Ohio House of Representatives last week approved a measure that would ban abortions at six weeks, while an Iowa law banning abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected is tied up in a court battle. [L2N1XW020]      Such laws are designed to end up before the Supreme Court, which has become more conservative following President Donald Trump’s appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.      The CDC study also showed 91.1 percent of abortions performed in 2015 were in a woman’s first 13 weeks of pregnancy. There was also a shift toward earlier abortions, with the number performed at six weeks or less increasing 11 percent. |||||","output":"Recently, a report shows that there are fewer women in the U.S. having abortions than before. In 2015, the number of abortions was 638,169, which is lower than the 652,639 in 2014. This is the lowest number since Roe v. Wade, which is when abortions became legal in 1973. The reason for this decline could be because of better access to birth control and state laws that make it more difficult for women to get abortions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Where do Ray and May have sex after the funeral? Hotel The answer is:","output":"Title: Mourning Embrace Plot Outline: The story revolves around Ray and May's complex relationship and emotional journey following the loss of a mutual friend whose funeral brings them together. Step 1: Setting up the background and characters Ray and May were childhood friends who grew apart as time went by. They were united after years of no contact to attend the funeral of their mutual friend, Sam. Both are devastated by the loss, but the grief is not the only thing they are dealing with; there are unresolved feelings and past emotions to navigate. Step 2: The Funeral At the funeral, tensions and shared nostalgia mix as they are reminded of their past and the emotional rollercoaster that was their childhood friendship. Their connection, however, does not go unnoticed. Friends and family members sense that something lies beneath the surface, adding pressure to the already emotional situation.  Step 3: Coming Closer Following the funeral, Ray and May have difficulty finding solace in the presence of others. As they escape the gathering, they find themselves drawn to each other, seeking comfort and understanding. They walk around the town, reminiscing about their shared past and uncovering feelings that had long been buried. Step 4: Hotel Room Decision Overwhelmed by their emotions, Ray and May realize they need a private space to continue their conversation and support each other. They agree to book a discreet hotel room to retreat to for the night. Step 5: The Night Once inside, the intimacy and privacy of the hotel room cause them to confront their unresolved feelings. As they share their thoughts, emotions, and regrets, they begin to reconnect on a deeper and more authentic level. The intense emotions and profound connection they feel lead them to have sex, both as an act of comfort and as a way to process their shared grief. Step 6: Aftermath and Reflection The next morning, Ray and May wake up to face reality. They understand that their night of intimacy was a shared moment of vulnerability that may not define their future relationship, but it's an essential part of their personal growth. They decide to give their friendship another chance, being entirely open and honest with each other and cherishing the bond they have always shared. Step 7: The Resolution As Ray and May exit the hotel, they agree to stay in touch and support one another as they navigate their lives following Sam's passing. The movie ends with the two setting up their next meeting, intent on regrowing their now intimate and understanding friendship. The answer to the question is: In the movie \\"Mourning Embrace,\\" Ray and May have sex at a hotel after attending their mutual friend's funeral, as an emotional response to shared grief and unresolved feelings between them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which researcher learned more about chlorine gases?  Two researchers studied air quality over the North Pole, and over Antarctica. Dan was more fond of the south pole, so he studied Antarctica, while Colt liked reading about the North Pole.  Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the question. The question is asking which researcher learned more about chlorine gases. Step 2: Locate relevant information in the text. The paragraph talks about the areas each researcher, Dan and Colt, studied: Dan studied Antarctica, while Colt studied the North Pole. The hint mentions that the ozone hole is created over Antarctica and that it is caused by chlorine and bromine gases. Step 3: Analyze the information. Since the hint mentions that the ozone hole (which is a direct result of chlorine and bromine gases) is over Antarctica, it is reasonable to infer that the researcher who studied Antarctica would have learned more about these gases. Step 4: Answer the question. Dan learned more about chlorine gases, as he studied Antarctica where the ozone hole is located due to the presence of these gases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For the best results, choose a white or light colored nylon suit. Use garbage bags, old towels, or an old tablecloth to protect surfaces. Work outside if possible. Acid dye will give you the best results. Choose one color for a monochrome design, or multiple colors for a more traditional tie dye look. Use rubber gloves to protect your skin while preparing the dye and while dyeing your swimsuit. Pull up small pieces of the fabric about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) apart and tie the material off with your rubber bands. Create interesting patterns by varying the amount of fabric you tie off and/or the spacing between each section. The longer you leave the suit in place, the darker the color will be. Rotate to a new section and a new color until the whole suit is covered with dye.  Dyeing time can be anywhere between 5 and 20 minutes depending on the base color of the suit and how dark of a shade you want. When using multiple colors, expect some of the colors to run together at the edges and create a new color. This will add more interest and color to your suit and is preferable to leaving areas without dye coverage. If you are using only one color, you can use a large dye bath and fully submerge the suit once you've tied it off with rubber bands.

But I'm sure she'll find the perfect blouse eventually with those criteria in mind. Did she mention whether she prefers long sleeves or short sleeves? Alice: She was quite specific about wanting long sleeves, actually. Supposedly, it's because she loves how elegant they look and they also keep her warm during her work meetings, as her office tends to be on the cooler side. Samantha: I can understand that. Long sleeves can look really classy, especially if the blouse has some kind of interesting detail or cut. Was she leaning towards getting a blouse from any particular store or brand? Alice: She didn't mention a particular store or brand, no. But she did mention that she had been browsing online stores and a few local boutiques in the hopes of finding her perfect blouse. She even considered looking into having a custom blouse made if she couldn't find one that met all her criteria. Samantha: Wow, she's really determined to find this blouse! I admire her dedication. If she decides to go the custom route, I know a great seamstress that could probably help her out. I'll let her know about it. Alice: That's a great idea, Sam! I'm sure she would appreciate the recommendation. Hopefully, she can find that perfect blouse soon, whether it's ready-made or custom. Samantha: Agreed! Next time we meet up with her, let's remember to ask her about her blouse-shopping progress. I'm genuinely curious to see what she ends up with. Alice: Definitely, that's a great idea. And who knows, we might even be inspired to go on a shopping adventure ourselves after hearing about her experience!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: While climbing in Monument Valley, siblings Peter (O'Donnell) and Annie Garrett (Tunney) lose their father, Royce (Stuart Wilson). After two falling amateurs leave the family dangling, Royce forces Peter to cut him loose to save Peter and his sister. Peter has since retired from climbing, becoming a full-time wildlife photographer, and Annie has gone on to become a renowned mountain climber. Their relationship is strained as Annie still blames Peter for obeying Royce instead of waiting for her to secure the rope. Three years later, during a wildlife photo shoot for National Geographic in the lower Himalayas in Pakistan, Peter's assistant falls and breaks his leg and has to be evacuated by the Pakistani Army stationed in a military station that monitors avalanches. Peter is dropped off at K2 Base Camp and searches for Annie who is planning a summit attempt on K2, the world's second highest and most dangerous mountain. The expedition is funded by wealthy industrialist Elliot Vaughn (Paxton) who is also taking part as he wants to attempt climbing the K2 for the second time after his first attempt ended in tragedy with him as sole survivor. Vaughn has the help of renowned climber Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea) and other expedition members include Pakistani mountaneer Ali Nazir. The day before the climb Vaughn throws a promotional party with all the people at base camp that is interrupted by reclusive Montgomery Wick (Glenn), reported to be the world's best climber and foremost expert on K2, who asks if it will be Vaughn or the experienced McLaren who will be making the decisions during the climb, as the team cannot have two leaders. Vaughn states that McLaren is the leader and later on explains that Wick is against him because his wife, a Sherpa guide, was one of the people who did not survive his previous expedition.

The paragraph starts with Peter being tired of his friend getting bullied every day, which indicates that his friend faced bullying regularly. Peter then discussed it with his father and sought help in finding a solution to this problem. The next time his friend faced bullying, Peter took action and asked the bully to stop. This courageous act was instrumental in preventing the bullying incident as the bully followed Peter's request. Afterward, Peter went on to befriend the bully over the next few weeks, which suggests that he not only intervened but also built a relationship with the bully to potentially prevent future incidents of bullying.

Putting up a fight: Mr Salmond, pictured at the Ryder Cup handover during the trip, defended its cost Alex Salmond yesterday dismissed criticism of a taxpayer-funded £51,000 trip to a five-star hotel in America as 'ridiculous frippery'. The Scottish First Minister confirmed that he stayed in the luxury Peninsula Hotel in Chicago during a trip to the Ryder Cup last year. It is one of the of the most exclusive hotels in the city and Mr Salmond has come under-fire for the stay which came during the official handover ceremony of the trophy. Golf fan Mr Salmond and his wife Moira were accompanied by Sports Minister Shona Robison, a team of 12 government officials and 22 workers from publicly funded agencies.

The most logical completion of the news story is that \\"Alex Salmond cannot account for how thousands of pounds of public money was spent.\\" This is because the story is focused on the controversy surrounding the taxpayer-funded trip of Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, his wife Moira, Sports Minister Shona Robison, government officials, and publicly funded agency workers. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: 1. America, Chicago, Hollywood, Peninsula Hotel, and Ryder Cup are not responsible for explaining the spending of public money concerning this specific trip. The responsibility lies with the government officials involved. 2. Beyonce and Brad Pitt are irrelevant to the news story as they are celebrities with no connection to the issue. 3. Labour is not mentioned or implied to be involved in this story. 4. Moira, as Alex Salmond's wife, would not be the one held responsible for explaining the funds. 5.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: I'm going to take something that happened to my daughter for this answer. Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse. Why was the daughter devestated? - not enough information - because she was late for school - because the dog ate her homework - because she fell in a sticker bush Answer:","output":"The daughter was devastated because the dog ate her homework. This made her concerned about not being able to turn in her completed homework on time and potentially becoming the laughing stock of the school when she had to provide the \\"dog ate my homework\\" excuse."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer.

Question: What is the effect of less air is pulled from outside the body on a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.? Solution:","output":"To answer this question, let's first understand the process and the guidelines provided: Process: 1. You inhale. 2. Your diaphragm moves down. 3. Your lungs have more room. 4. Your lungs fill with air. 5. You exhale. 6. Your diaphragm moves back up. 7. Carbon dioxide is exhaled. 8. You start the process over again.

Now let's apply the guidelines to the question: Question: What is the effect of less air being pulled from outside the body on a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream? Considering the process, when you inhale, your lungs fill with air, which is then used to deliver oxygen to the bloodstream. Thus, if less air is pulled from outside the body, it means that there is less air (containing oxygen) available to be delivered to the bloodstream. This suggests that the first event has a negative effect on the second event.

DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED SINCE IT WAS A GIFT! Answer: Possible answers: [1]. No; [2]. Yes; Answer:","output":"Based on the given review, it appears that the user would not recommend this product. There are several reasons for this conclusion: 1. The user writes that the video was sold as \\"NEW,\\" but it did not arrive in the expected condition. It had no plastic seal and appeared to have already been opened. This suggests that the product may have been falsely advertised or mishandled, which can be frustrating for a customer who was expecting a brand-new item. 2. The user expresses deep disappointment in the product because it was intended as a gift. This highlights the importance of the product's condition and presentation, especially when it's meant for someone else. The fact that the product seemed used or opened could potentially have a negative impact on the gifting experience, making it less likely that the user would recommend this product to others. 3. The reviewer uses strong language to convey their feelings about the product, such as \\"DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED.\\" This indicates a significant level of dissatisfaction and reinforces the idea that the user would not recommend this product based on their experience.

This is because, as stated in the given fact, lighter and more streamlined vehicles require less energy to move. A heavier vehicle would have a higher inertia, meaning it would require more energy to accelerate or decelerate. As a result, the engine would have to work harder to propel the vehicle, leading to increased fuel consumption. Therefore, the fuel efficiency would decrease as the weight of the vehicle increases.

By Snejana Farberov Playboy magnate: Marc Leder, 50, the co-CEO of Sun Capital Partners, has become notorious for hosting wild parties in the Hamptons A secretly taped video featuring Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney unfavorably sounding off on President Barack Obama’s supporters was recorded at the house of a playboy hedge fund manager who has gained notoriety for debauched sex parties, according to latest reports. Marc Leder, 50, the co-CEO of Sun Capital Partners in Boca Raton, Florida, hosted a fundraiser for the former governor of Massachusetts in May. During the exclusive 50,000-a-plate event, Romney was caught on video dismissing the 47 per cent of Americans who allegedly support President Obama as freeloaders who depend on the government. The Republican candidate said that","output":"these people believe they are entitled to healthcare, food, housing, and other basic needs, suggesting that this segment of the population is not concerned with personal responsibility or contributing to society. This controversial remark drew widespread criticism and was widely reported in the media, significantly impacting Romney's presidential campaign and public image. At the heart of this media storm was Marc Leder, whose extravagant and notorious parties have made headlines in recent years. Leder, who made his fortune managing hedge funds, is a well-known figure in both the financial world and the social scene of the Hamptons, an exclusive enclave on Long Island in New York, popular among the rich and famous for its lavish mansions and pristine beaches. Leder's wild parties have become the stuff of legend in the area, with jealous neighbors whispering about the opulent gatherings he hosts at his luxurious 500,000-per-month rented estate. These affairs are said to involve an eclectic mix of guests, ranging from Wall Street tycoons to celebrities, artists, and the occasional famous politician. According to insiders, the parties often involve excessive drinking, drugs, and scandalous sexual escapades. It was at one of these infamous gatherings that Romney's candid statements about the significant portion of the American population who support President Obama were secretly taped. The recording quickly went viral, sparking heated debates both about Romney's assertions and the ethics of recording and releasing such a video. The incident not only fueled the image of Romney as an out-of-touch elitist who did not understand or empathize with struggling Americans but also cast a spotlight on the exclusive world of the ultra-wealthy, and their apparent disregard for the less fortunate. The revelation that it was Leder's event at which the controversial video was recorded only served to heighten the intrigue around this playboy hedge fund manager. As the public struggled to understand how a man who enjoyed such a debauched lifestyle could choose to align himself with a conservative political candidate, many questions were raised about the nature of political fundraising and the role of money in American politics. In the wake of the scandal, both Romney and Leder faced negative repercussions. Romney's presidential ambitions were dealt a significant blow, with many pointing to the leaked video as a turning point in the 2012 election. The once-promising candidate ultimately lost to President Obama, and his political career never fully recovered. Leder, on the other hand, faced increased scrutiny of his personal life and business dealings. His risqué reputation became inextricably linked with the Romney scandal, damaging his social standing and leaving many in the Hamptons trading gossip about his tarnished name. While he continued to wield considerable influence in the financial world, Leder's political affiliations and party-hosting days were seemingly curtailed by the fallout from the infamous leaked video. Thus, the story of Romney's downfall and the ensuing scandal provides a cautionary tale about the dangers of political fundraising in a world of increasing surveillance and moral complexity. At the center of it all was Marc Leder, the playboy hedge fund magnate, whose wild parties ultimately played an unexpected role in shaping the course of American politics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Doctors gave sedative to the patient complaining of pain, what did he say afterwards? Possible A: enjoyment, good sometimes, immobilize, feels good, good feeling  Why is \\"feels good\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Feels good\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. Firstly, it is essential to understand the context of the question. The question posed is related to the medical field and focuses on a patient receiving sedatives, which are drugs specifically prescribed to alleviate pain, relax muscles, and reduce anxiety or agitation. Given this context, it is natural to expect the patient's response to express relief or satisfaction, which is reflected in the answer \\"feels good.\\"  Secondly, the options given for the answer are: enjoyment, good sometimes, immobilize, feels good, and good feeling. Analyzing these options individually: 1. \\"Enjoyment\\" refers to a sensation of pleasure or joy that may be unrelated to the relief from pain or anxiety. In the given context, it may indicate that the individual has a casual or frivolic approach towards consuming sedatives which may lead to potential misuse, misunderstanding, or risks associated with drugs. 2. \\"Good sometimes\\" is vague because it does not explicitly convey whether the sedative provided relief for the specific situation in question. The occasional nature of the relief may also not provide an adequate responsibility expected from the doctors in the scenario. 3. \\"Immobilize\\" implies that the patient's physical movement is hindered or restricted. While sedatives may relax muscles, this term does not directly address the feelings of relief or pain reduction experienced by the patient. 4. \\"Feels good\\" directly indicates that the patient experiences a positive sensation, likely as a result of relief from pain or anxiety. It reflects a reasonable response to the effective administration of sedatives by doctors. 5. \\"Good feeling\\" is similar to \\"enjoyment\\" and may also indicate an unnecessarily positive or frivolic association with sedatives. The term does not focus on relief from pain or anxiety, which are the intended purposes of sedatives. Considering these explanations, \\"feels good\\" is the most appropriate response from a human common sense perspective. It aligns with the intended purpose of sedatives and conveys that the patient experienced relief or relaxation after being administered the medication. The other options, though relevant, either lack direct clarity in expressing the effect of sedatives or may convey a potential for misuse or misinterpretation of medical prescriptions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. News article: You may love your Tesla, but that doesn’t make it any less prone to accidents than other cars. If you want an example, consider that a Tesla driver in Utah recently found that his Model S loaner had parked itself automatically into the back of a trailer.      After analyzing logs, the carmaker told him that he’s the only person to blame for the accident. Apparently, the car’s auto-parking feature was initiated, which is why the car hit the back of the trailer.      DON’T MISS: Amazon’s 12 best daily deals: A 50 smartphone, a 150 smart TV, and plenty more      The Summon feature is still in beta and requires human oversight. Tesla advises users to monitor the self-parking feature at all times and intervene to avoid obstacles that could cause accidents.      The driver, Jared Overton, said that he did not activate the Summon feature and that he was near the vehicle for some 20 seconds talking about it with a nearby worker at the business he was visiting. Overton said he parked well behind the trailer, but the car somehow drove itself into it, failing to detect the trailer’s bed.      Overton and the worker discovered the car a few minutes later when exiting the business.      “We were trying to figure out how on earth the vehicle started on its own,” Overton told KSL. “What happened with this kind of rogue vehicle?”      Tesla sent a letter to Overton telling him that it was practically his fault, suggesting he may have invoked the Summon feature and that he may have failed to monitor the car.      “Tesla has reviewed the vehicle’s logs, which show that the incident occurred as a result of the driver not being properly attentive to the vehicle’s surroundings while using the Summon feature or maintaining responsibility for safely controlling the vehicle at all times,” the letter said.      The Summon feature “was initiated by a double-press of the gear selector stalk button, shifting from Drive to Park and requesting Summon activation” Tesla explained. It all happened three seconds after Overton exited the car and closed the door, the letter explained.      The driver disagrees, saying that even if he accidentally started Summon, he would have been able to hear it and stop it.      “Even during that 15, 20-second walk right here, we would have easily heard the impact of the vehicle into the back of the trailer,” Overton said. “They can tell me what they want to tell me with the logs, but it doesn’t change what we know happened here.”      “They’re just assuming that I sat there and watched it happen, and I was OK with that,” Overton said.      A Tesla spokesperson told KSL that the Summon feature is in beta, and each driver has to agree to certain terms and conditions before enabling it. These conditions say that the driver has to be in proximity of the car when using its autonomous features to be able to assume manual control if something goes wrong.      “This feature will park Model S while the driver is outside the vehicle,” the statement said. “Please note that the vehicle may not detect certain obstacles, including those that are very narrow (e.g., bikes), lower than the fascia, or hanging from the ceiling. As such, Summon requires that you continually monitor your vehicle’s movement and surroundings while it is in progress and that you remain prepared to stop the vehicle at any time using your key fob or mobile app or by pressing any door handle. You must maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle when using this feature and should only use it on private property.”      Overton said the statement practically dismissed the experience of two witnesses. “Imagine if a child was right there — I guarantee that they would be responding to this a lot differently,” Overton said. “I will not feel safe with my little boy playing in the garage or the driveway if there’s the potential for a rogue vehicle.” ||||| A Tesla owner in Utah says that he returned to his parked Model S to find that it had crept forward and crashed into the trailer parked ahead of it. The man claims that this all went down without explanation; Tesla refutes that claim, saying that after taking a look at the car's logs, it determined that the Summon feature had been activated, which autonomously calls the car to (or from) the waiting driver without anyone behind the wheel.      The owner says that he was answering questions about the car from a passerby, so it's entirely possible that he opened the app and accidentally activated Summon (for what it's worth, he claims he didn't). But here's the thing: it doesn't matter. Under no circumstances should a production vehicle autonomously collide with a parked vehicle mere feet ahead of it. I think that's common sense, right? Am I saying anything controversial?      As a refresher, here's Tesla's video explaining how Summon works:      A letter to the owner from a regional Tesla service manager obtained by KSL says that \\"the incident occurred as a result of the driver not being properly attentive to the vehicle's surroundings while using the Summon feature or maintaining responsibility for safely controlling the vehicle at all times.\\" Perhaps! But cars — by virtue of the fact that people of all walks of life and levels of attentiveness use them — are supposed to be far more bulletproof than this by the time they reach production. It's why the FCA just recalled over a million cars with confusing shift levers, because a driver who isn't paying attention could fail to put it in park.      In other words, Summon — and similar features that will inevitably come from other manufacturers — can't rely on an attentive owner to keep the car from smashing into something. It's one of the reasons why Google and a half-dozen automakers are moving more slowly with commercial autonomous deployments. Tesla will be quick to note that Summon is \\"in beta,\\" but owners are going to use it either way, and unfortunately, we can't always expect them to use good judgement.      We can't be required to be smarter than the software      The notion of safety-critical \\"beta\\" software in deployment on commercial vehicles is a relatively new one, and it's something that regulatory agencies aren't equipped to deal with. I suspect that in a decade or two, there will be a well-established framework of tests that systems like Summon will have to pass before being allowed on a production car. But for now, it's the Wild West.      In a statement to KSL, Tesla says that Summon \\"may not detect certain obstacles, including those that are very narrow (e.g., bikes), lower than the fascia, or hanging from the ceiling.\\" In this incident, the trailer is very high — it only comes as low as the midpoint of the Model S's windshield. But we've seen autonomous vehicles solve much harder problems than this (just watch any of Nvidia's keynotes on computer vision in self-driving cars from the past couple years). And coincidentally, the Model S is equipped with a forward-facing camera mounted at rear view mirror height.      That is to say: \\"beta\\" or no, owner liability disclaimer or no, a car capable of autonomously crashing itself into a stationary object in normal operating conditions should never have been sold. Tested, yes — sold, no.      We humans just aren't smart enough to handle something like that.      Update May 11th 3:02PM ET: We saw the letter that Tesla sent to the vehicle's owner, which details what happened. You can read our full story here.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What camp used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge?, using the article: The bank building was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building. In 1955 Dallas Barrack, a Springdale antique dealer, bought Oklahoma Row, and renovated it into an antique store called the Palace Art Galleries.

The great American filmmaker and story teller Frank Capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused World War II and Hitler's rise. Every school child, nay, every American should watch these films today because they are so apropos. History has been repeating itself over and over again! The Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking; the tactics used by the Nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the Communists and now by Muslim terrorist groups, are still working to these evil group's advantage. By sitting back and letting Hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive - France, America and England caused over 50 million people's deaths. Americans, French and British today would happily let Hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties.

Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff.

In court documents published on Monday, it came to light that the men had discussed attacking an African - American school and killing 14 of them.  Another crime was about planning to murder Presidential candidate Barack Obama. According to their affidavits , the suspects' \\"final act of violence\\" would be when they attacked Obama while wearing white suits and top hats and driving \\"their vehicle as fast as they could toward Obama shooting at him from the windows.\\"  The two suspects are Paul Schlesselman, 18, of West Helena, Arkansas and Daniel Cowart, 20, of Bells, Tennessee. According to the court papers, they met last month over the Internet through a friend. Schlesselman and Cowart are believed to share \\"very strong views\\" about White Power.  Schlesselman listed \\"being racist\\" as his occupation on his MySpace page. He further wrote: \\"I'm white. I'm proud. I get angry. I like guns.\\"  Cowart also had a MySpace page on which photos of guns were presented under a heading of \\"My Guns\\". On his page he wrote, \\"Better to die quick fighting on your feet than to live forever begging on your knees.\\"  Some have questioned the pair's ability to carry out the charged plan, but authorities have been very concerned about Obama as the first black presidential candidate from a major party.  \\"We honestly don't know if they had the ability or the skill to carry out the kind of plan that they talked about.\\" said Malcolm Wiley, of the United States Secret Service in an interview with The New York Times. \\"But we take any threat seriously no matter how big or how small it is.\\"  Cowart and Schlesselman are scheduled to appear before a judge on Thursday. 1.

Projects keep piling, deadlines looming, and no end in sight. Coffee machines broke down too, what's next? Productivity is taking a nosedive. Could do with a bit of luck for a change...#toughday #stressful\\" This tweet is a reflection of negative emotions. It expresses dissatisfaction and stress related to work, the brewing tension of upcoming deadlines, the breakdown of coffee machines (which could be seen as a small but important coping mechanism during stressful work situations), and the overall decrease in productivity. The hashtags 'toughday' and 'stressful' further signify the exasperation and negativity experienced by the poster. Emotions such as unhappiness, frustration, and discontentment underpin these kind of negative sentiment tweets. Sentiment analysis, often used in data analysis and AI programming, would categorize this tweet as negative based on the implicit dissatisfaction and explicit complaints about the user's day at work. Negative sentiment can be used to identify individuals' areas of complaint or dissatisfaction, which can provide useful feedback to organizations if the negative sentiment is directed towards them or their products/services.  It's worth noting that just as with individual people, the sentiment behind a tweet can be complex and contain elements of several emotions simultaneously.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Kenny will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near his farm. This is because Kenny is currently using a low amount of fertilizer, as he mainly grows tomatoes which are not in season right now. On the other hand, Bobby has increased his fertilizer usage dramatically due to his large potato order. When rain dissolves the fertilizers in the soil, runoff carries it away and eventually deposits the nitrogen-rich fertilizer into nearby bodies of water, including ponds. This excess nitrogen causes the growth of algae to rapidly increase, depleting carbon dioxide levels in the water. When the algae die, decomposers break them down and use up the oxygen in the process, leading to the creation of dead zones. Since Kenny is using less fertilizer than Bobby, the likelihood of dead zones forming in ponds near Kenny's farm is lower compared to ponds near Bobby's farm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.  Now, I have a new situation: The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.  Answer this question please: Which group of larvae had more changes in their RNA sequence? A:","output":"Based on the given information, Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while Group D did not. Therefore, Group L had more changes in their RNA sequence as compared to Group D. The mutations in Group L likely led to variation in their RNA sequences, while Group D maintained more consistent and stable sequences.

Movie title: Four Christmases Movie plot: Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) are an upscale San Francisco couple. Having both come from dysfunctional families, with divorced parents and siblings with out-of-control kids, the two disdain the idea of getting married or having kids. In an effort to avoid their families at Christmas, the two go on vacation abroad while pretending to be doing charity work there. The third Christmas of their relationship, Brad and Kate are trapped at San Francisco International Airport by a fog bank that cancels every outbound flight, and interviewed by a news crew, alerting their families to the fact they're stuck at home for the holidays. With no way to get out of it, Kate and Brad find themselves visiting their families on Christmas Day. They first visit Brad's father (Robert Duvall), then Kate's mother (Mary Steenburgen), then Brad's mother (Sissy Spacek) and, finally, Kate's father (Jon Voight), thereby celebrating four Christmases in one day. As they brace themselves for a marathon of homecomings, Brad and Kate expect the worst, but are nevertheless unable to prepare themselves enough for what they get. As the day progresses, each discover a new secret about their partner that they had previously been too embarrassed to share, namely that Brad's real name is \\"Orlando\\", and Kate has a fear of inflatable castles, stemming from being ostracized as a child, and these discoveries put an intense strain on their relationship. While Brad counts down the minutes to freedom, Kate finds herself looking at the lives of Brad's and her own siblings and comes to realize that she does want a marriage and children of her own, the prospect of which frightens Brad when she mentions it to him. Eventually, in the final visit of the day, at Kate's father's house, Kate asks Brad to let her spend the visit on her own and claims to her family that they had split up. Meanwhile, Brad spends some time at his own father's house with just his father and realises that he wants a marriage and children, and that he loves Kate way too...

On June 15, 2007, the Jaguars released veteran strong safety Donovin Darius, who had seen diminished playing time in previous years due to mounting injuries. On August 31, 2007, the Jaguars announced that long time back-up quarterback David Garrard would start for the team, ahead of former first round draft pick Byron Leftwich, who was released in the teams final roster cuts. Garrard led the Jaguars to an 11–5 record and a wild card spot in the 2007–08 NFL playoffs. The Jaguars defeated the 2007 Pittsburgh Steelers season 31–29 to win their first playoff game in almost eight years and their first road playoff win since 1997. It was also the first time in the 50+ year history of the Steelers that they had been beaten twice at home by the same team in the same season. However, in the divisional round, the Jaguars fell to the then-undefeated 2007 New England Patriots season; the teams were tied at halftime, but the Patriots pulled ahead and won 31–20. Tom Brady completed 26 of 28 passes in this game, being pressured by the Jaguars defense only once, on the first play.  This game, more than any other, gave the Jaguars front office a strong desire to upgrade the pass rush during the offseason.

Joseph speaks with high pitch voice.. (B). Craig speaks with high pitch voice.. Complete the following sentence. Joseph plugs his ear when he is with Craig because","output":"Joseph plugs his ear when he is with Craig because Craig speaks with a high pitch voice (B). Craig's high-pitched voice might make it difficult for Joseph to feel comfortable or focus on the conversation, leading him to take measure to avoid auditory discomfort. High pitch voices can sometimes be challenging for individuals to tolerate due to their frequency and tone. This might cause people to instinctively plug their ears or move away in order to protect their hearing and maintain a sense of auditory comfort. Although Craig may not necessarily mean to cause any discomfort to others, his naturally high-pitched voice might become a source of irritation or distraction to those around him, particularly to people who are sensitive to certain noises and sounds, like Joseph. In some cases, people might find high pitch voices annoying, as they can lead to headaches or even nausea in extreme situations. This is because the human brain works to process and filter different sounds that we hear, and our inner ear plays a significant role in maintaining balance and spatial orientation. When we experience disruptive frequencies, such as a high-pitched voice, our auditory system might be overstimulated, causing discomfort or difficulty in processing the sounds. Joseph could be engaging in a self-preservation technique by plugging his ear in order to reduce the impact of Craig's high pitched voice on his auditory system. This might help Joseph maintain his ability to concentrate and participate in the conversation without becoming distracted or overwhelmed by the high pitch. Additionally, Joseph's decision to plug his ear might stem from his attempt to send a subtle message to Craig that his high pitched voice has a negative effect on him. Whether intentional or not, this action could potentially prompt a discussion around the matter and lead to a more comfortable environment for both individuals in their future interactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence is positive. The reviewer has used several strong, complimentary adjectives to describe the film, which indicate a favorable impression. Firstly, the word \\"breathtakingly\\" is a powerful modifier that suggests the movie has exceeded expectations and elicited a strong emotional reaction. It indicates the reviewer is impressed and almost overwhelmed by how good the film is. Secondly, the reviewer mentions the film as being \\"assured,\\" which denotes confidence in the execution and delivery of the story by the director (in this instance, Jeffs). This word choice suggests that the movie's vision is clear, and the director was able to communicate it effectively, resulting in a strong, cohesive final product. The term \\"stylish\\" implies that the film's aesthetics are both visually appealing and artistically significant. It suggests that the movie stands out in terms of design and cinematography, contributing to a unique and memorable experience for the audience. Furthermore, the \\"spare dialogue\\" mentioned in the review highlights the film's minimalist approach to conversation, which is seen as a positive aspect. It suggests that the dialogue is concise and to the point but still manages to convey the intended emotions and messages effectively. This indicates the reviewer respects the movie's ability to rely on other elements – such as visual storytelling or the actors' performances – to communicate with the audience. Lastly, the phrase \\"acute expressiveness\\" showcases the film's powerful delivery of emotions and feelings. This indicates that the movie is successful in evoking deep, intense emotions within the viewer, further supporting the positive nature of the review. In conclusion, this movie review sentence is resoundingly positive, as the reviewer uses multiple adjectives to praise the film's visual appeal, dialogue, emotional depth, and directorial confidence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: Image copyright FBI Image caption The Hellers purchased the painting, one of Chagall's early works from his time in Paris, in the 1920s      A Marc Chagall painting stolen from a New York couple's home in 1988 will be returned to the family's estate after nearly 30 years, the FBI says.      The 1911 painting, Othello and Desdemona, was taken from Ernest and Rose Heller's flat with more than a dozen other works of art and jewellery.      The Chagall was recovered last year after a Washington, DC gallery owner twice refused to purchase the painting.      He told the seller to contact the authorities for proof of ownership.      \\"We took the case from there,\\" said Special Agent Marc Hess, a member of the FBI Art Crime Team.      The Maryland man who tried to sell the work had stored it in his attic for years in a customised box he fashioned out of a door jamb and plywood, according to Mr Hess.      He was given the painting in the late 1980s or early 1990s from another man who is suspected of taking it from the Upper East Side building where the Hellers lived, prosecutors said in a court filing on Thursday.      The couple owned works of art by Renoir, Picasso, Hopper and Chagall, the bureau said.      Mr Heller was a retired jewel importer who died in 1998 and his wife passed away in 2003.      The Maryland man, who has not been named, said he planned to sell the stolen Chagall to a potential buyer, but the deal fell through after a dispute over his cut of the earnings, the FBI said. Instead, he kept the painting in his attic and attempted to sell it in 2011 and again in 2017.      The painting, which depicts Shakespeare's Othello holding a sword as he gazes down at his bride, Desdemona, was still marked with the names of its owners, \\"Mr + Mrs ES Heller, New York\\", when the Maryland man tried to sell it, according to the Washington Post.      The art gallery owner rebuffed his offer, noted that it required documents proving ownership and referred the man to the FBI, according to prosecutors.      \\"Well-documented and known art is very hard to move once it has been stolen,\\" said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Tim Carpenter.      \\"Gallery owners are our first line of defence in identifying pieces of art that do not have the appropriate documentation and should be brought to the attention of law enforcement.\\"      Prosecutors asked a court on Thursday to approve the return of the painting to the family's estate to put up for auction.      The proceeds will be given to the insurance company that paid the theft claim and to charities supported by the family estate.      Statute of limitations laws on the robbery have expired, which means the suspected thief and the Maryland man will not face charges.      The suspected thief was previously convicted in federal court and served a prison term in connection with selling other stolen property, the agency said.      Alan Scott, an attorney for Mr Heller's estate and is the executor for Mrs Heller, told the Washington Post \\"of all the works that could have been recovered, this is the one that would have pleased them the most\\". ||||| Thirty years after it was stolen, an early Marc Chagall has been recovered by the FBI. The painting, titled Othello and Desdemona, belonged to retired jeweler and art collector Ernest “Pick” Heller and his wife Rose “Red” Heller, and was stolen from their New York apartment back in 1988, along with numerous other paintings, sculptures, and art objects including jewelry, carpets, silverware, and Steuben china.      “We often work on recoveries that are over 25 years old but this one is unique for the outstanding work performed by law enforcement 30 years after the theft,” Chris Marinello of Art Recovery, who represents the Hellers’ insurance company, told artnet News in an email. “The FBI and US Attorney’s Office could have easily dismissed this matter as ‘ancient history’ but they pursued it with precision and vigor.”      Ernest and Rose, then 85 and 88, had returned from their annual two-month trip to Aspen, Colorado, only to find their apartment had been robbed. They had an alarm system installed, but there was no sign of a break in.      Today, investigators believe the theft was committed by someone who worked in the building and had access to the security system. The culprit was, according to a statement, later “convicted in federal district court of interstate transportation of stolen property and mail fraud related to the theft and sale of other works of art from other apartment buildings.”      In addition to Chagall, the couple owned some 21 paintings and 12 sculptures in all, including works by August Renoir, Othon Friesz, Georges Rouault, Pablo Picasso, and Edward Hopper. At the time of the robbery, the couple’s stolen property was collectively valued at an estimated 600,000. Adjusting for inflation, that would be 1.3 million today.      “It was a lifetime of collecting,” Ernest told UPI at the time of the crime. “I liked them all, but the Chagall was a very interesting one because it was a 1911 painting.” He expressed his doubts that his stolen valuables would ever be recovered. To date, Othello and Desdemona is the only piece from the heist to have been found; 13 other paintings remain missing.      The FBI’s Art Crime Team tracked down the painting with the help of a gallery in Washington, DC. According to a complaint filed today in US District Court and titled United States v. One Oil Painting Entitled Othello and Desdemona by Marc Chagall for the District of Columbia, “Person 1” approached “Person 2” in the late 1980s or early ’90s, for help selling the stolen Chagall to persons involved with Bulgarian organized crime. The deal fell through, after the first party tried to cut the second out of the deal—they later accused the second, who wound up with the painting, of stealing the work. (Because of the ongoing investigation into the other paintings whereabouts, the FBI is not revealing the names of any of the parties involved.)      Person 2 brought the painting to the DC gallery in 2011, and again in 2017. An unidentified third party had previously brought the painting to the gallery back in 1989. All three times, the dealer said they could not help sell the piece without proof of ownership and provenance. Encouraged by the gallery, and now 72-years-old, terminally ill, and looking to clear his conscience, Person 2 finally contacted the FBI, who took possession of the painting in January 2017.      Today’s filing is a civil forfeiture, which allows the government to seize stolen property without starting criminal proceedings against a suspected guilty party. “That doesn’t mean that we aren’t going to prosecute someone later,” noted Zia Faruqui, the prosecutor on the case, in a phone call with artnet News.      Othello and Desdemona had been appraised at Sotheby’s for 50,000–65,000 in 1974. It was originally purchased by Ernest’s father Samuel Heller for just 50 in 1913. A student at Ècole Julien Art School in Paris, Samuel was friends with Fernand Léger, who likely introduced him to Chagall.      After seizing the painting, the FBI discovered a label on the back, in German, that identified “Mr. + Mrs. E.S. Heller, New York” as the “besitzer,” the German word for owner. The couple had lent the piece to a Chagall exhibition at the Kunsthaus Zurich in Geneva, Switzerland in 1967—and even rebuffed an offer from a local gallery interested in buying it.      “We were fairly luckily because the tag from Zurich had a space for owners,” FBI case agent Marc Hess admitted to artnet News. From there, investigators were able to track down news articles about the theft, and contact Alan Scott, the lawyer for the Hellers’ estate, who confirmed that the painting was their stolen property.      “Both of the Hellers were philanthropic and highly active in the NYC arts scene in the mid-20th century,” Scott told artnet News. Ernest Heller died in 1998 at 95, and Rose Heller in 2003 at 105.      They had nieces and nephews, but their will primarily benefitted the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire, a contemporary art residency. The proceeds of the painting’s sale will be split between MacDowell (80 percent) and New York’s Columbia University and NYU Medical Center (10 percent each).      “Normally, the insurance company claims the entire proceeds in cases like this, but given that the money would be going to charity, the company agreed to take just their pay-out amount and nothing more,” said Marinello. He said the Hellers had received 100,000 from their insurance policy for the stolen painting.      Today, according to the artnet Price Database, Chagall’s work routinely sells for millions at auction. His record is 28.45 million for Les Amoureux, a 1928 canvas of a man and women embracing. The painting, sold in November at Sotheby’s New York, is said to depict the artist’s first wife and great love, Bella Rosenfeld.      Othello and Desdemona, however, is unlikely to reach similar heights. “It’s not a particularly attractive painting, nor from the photograph does it appear to be in particularly good condition,” art adviser Todd Levin told artnet News. “Similar pieces have sold in the relatively recent past, and I think they’d be lucky to get 600,000 today, including buyer’s premium.”      “A sensible auction estimate would be 300,000–500,000, and it’s very possible that the painting might not sell at all,” he added. “This is not an important painting in the artists’ output by subject matter, scale, period, or in any other way.” Levin noted that the fact that the work had been missing for so many years would probably only diminish its value, due to the likelihood that the painting was improperly stored.      Marinello cited a higher figure. “We have been given preliminary estimates of around 700,000–900,000,” he said. “The provenance is impeccable. The victim’s father purchased the painting from Chagall himself. There is a significant exhibition history as well.”      Regardless of the painting’s monetary value, its recovery after three decades remains a major accomplishment. “I was just blown away that 30 years after a crime occurred in New York that FBI agents were looking for this property in DC and doing the hard work to track down who the proper owners were and get it back to them,” said Faruqui. “Now it’s going to a charity, and it speaks really highly of the bureau. It’s a real feel good story!”      Follow artnet News on Facebook: ||||| NEW YORK -- A lifetime art collection worth about 600,000, including a 1911 Marc Chagall painting, was taken from a wired Manhattan apartment, one of the octogenarian occupants said Thursday.      'We can't understand how they got in and how they got out without being detected,' Ernest Heller, 85, a retired jeweler, said of the burglary of his apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side.      'We have a security system here that signals how and when people enter,' he said. 'They must have known how to turn it off.'      Heller and his 88-year-old wife, who only goes by the nickname, 'Red,' had returned to their apartment about 11 p.m. Wednesday from their annual two-month vacation in Aspen, Colo., when they discovered the burglary.      He said detectives rushed to the apartment and stayed until 2 a.m. collecting fingerprints.      The investigation continued Thursday and no determination was made on how the burglary was pulled off, said police Sgt. John Clifford.      'We have no idea how they got into the apartment. There were no apparent signs of a break-in,' Clifford said.      Jewelry, paintings, sculptures, silverware and carpets, valued at more than 600,000, were taken from the apartment, he said.      Among the valuables taken were Steuben china, Heller said. 'It was a lifetime of collecting.'      Among the paintings were those by Renoir, Chagall and Roualt, he said.      'I liked the Chagall. I liked them all, but the Chagall was a very interesting one because it was a 1911 painting.'      The Chagall painting was entitled 'Othello and Desdemona,' he said.      The jewelry, which was not very important, included personal items belonging to Heller's wife and his 'dinner (diamond) studs,' he said.      Heller said he and his wife were very upset about the theft.      'It's all in the hands of the police.' Heller said.

Movie title: I Drink Your Blood Context: The film opens on a Satanic ritual conducted by Horace Bones, the leader of a Manson-like cult. The ritual is unknowingly witnessed by Sylvia, a young girl who has been observing them from the trees. Sylvia is eventually spotted by one of the members and is dragged in front of the group. She manages to run away but is soon caught and raped by several of the cult members. The next morning, Sylvia emerges from the woods beaten and apparently raped. She is found by Mildred, the woman who runs the local bakery, and Pete, Sylvia's younger brother. They return Sylvia home to her grandfather, Doc Banner. Mildred seeks help from her boyfriend, leader of the construction crew working on the nearby dam which has bought up most of the town leaving it deserted. The cult members' van breaks down so they elect to remain in the town. They buy pies from Mildred who explains that as most of the town is deserted and awaiting demolition they can stay in any vacant building they wish. Learning of the assault on Sylvia, Doc confronts the cult but they assault him and force him to take LSD. Pete intervenes and Doc is released. Enraged by the incident, Pete takes a shotgun to get revenge but encounters a rabid dog which he shoots. He takes blood from the dog and the next morning injects it into meat pies at the bakery, and sells them to the cult members. Back at their house, Horace and the others eat the meat pies. The others begin to show signs of infection, and eventually they lapse into animalistic behavior. The infected members then proceed to attack and kill each other in a feral rage. One of the female members of the group, Molly becomes terrified and rushes off into the night. Construction workers sent there by Mildred's boyfriend find Molly and take her with them.

We say we're \\"in the pink\\" when we are in good health. It is easy to understand how this expression was born. When my face has a nice fresh, pink colour, it is a sign which shows my health is good. The colour green is natural for trees, it is an unnatural colour for humans. When someone doesn't feel well, for example, we say he looks green. When someone is angry because he doesn't have what someone else has, we say he is \\"green with envy\\". Some people are \\"green with envy\\" because someone else has more dollars, or \\"greenbacks\\". Dollars are called \\"greenback\\" because that's the colour of the backside of the money. Blue is a cool colour. The traditional blue music of American blacks is the opposite of red hot music. It is slow, sad and soulful  . To be blue, of course, is to be sad. The colour black is often used in expressions. People describe a day in which everything goes wrong as a \\"black day\\". A \\"black sheep\\" is the member of a family or group who always seems to be in trouble. If someone meets a \\"black cat\\", something unlucky might happen to him. Not all the \\"black\\" expressions have bad meanings. A company \\"in the red\\" is losing  money. If someone tells you to put someone \\"in black and white\\", they want you to write it down.

Throughout the write-up, the reviewer expresses dissatisfaction and critiques multiple aspects of the movie. When analyzing deeper, we can discern certain aspects that the reviewer particularly dislikes. The first is the believability of the plot and setting, as they stated \\"Very improbable orphanage on Bala\\" indicating that they found it unrealistic. They also specifically criticize certain actors' performances citing that \\"Fulton MacKay was far better in Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was better in anything else and Diana Dors did what she did best\\" indicating that they were unimpressed with the performances, believing the actors have executed much better work in other projects. However, there are mixed sentiments as well, demonstrated in the appreciation for specific elements of the film. The reviewer, for instance, cited \\"Cushing and Lee at their height.\\" and \\"Some nice scenery.\\" suggesting that they admired the performances of these specific actors and the visual aesthetics of the production. The concept of face-spotting is mentioned as a potential plus, indicating that the viewer may find enjoyment identifying and recognizing actors.

Article: When you were young, ginger ale may have been a popular choice for reducing the unpleasant feelings caused by your upset stomach on the road to get to school. For years, ginger has been used to reduce the effects of nausea . But do you know it's now also being looked at to fight cancer? Scientists have discovered that ginger can kill cancerous cells in two different ways. On the one hand, ginger causes the cancer cells to \\"commit suicide\\" by destroying themselves while leaving the surrounding healthy cells untouched. Ginger can prevent the growth of diseased cells by destroying the environment they grow in. On the other hand, ginger tricks the diseased cells and causes them to fight among themselves. Researchers are now looking into one of the toughest cancers to fight. However, scientists find repeated treatment of disease by drugs can actually lose its effectiveness over time as the cancer builds up resistance to the same treatment. This raises researchers' confidence that ginger would help stop resistance from the cancer. In a study, the cancer clearly stopped growing in the body of the mice that had been given ginger. The bad news is that such encouraging research has only been conducted on mice. The good news, however, is that it seems humans might be able to get the same benefit just by eating products with ginger and ginger root in them. Cancer prevention and fighting abilities aren't the only potential benefits you may get from adding a bit more ginger to your diet. Drinking ginger ale when your stomach was upset as a child wasn't just a placebo .Numerous studies and research, including the Mayo Clinic's strict grading system, agree that ginger has some sort of anti-nausea characteristics. Some believe that ginger works well against nausea after operations, while others use it to reduce motion sickness such as seasickness and car sickness. The Mayo Clinic, however, advises the use of ginger only to reduce nausea during pregnancy. While more research needs to be done, early studies are very promising,... Question: Why do scientists think ginger can be used to fight against cancer? - Ginger can destroy diseased cells in two different ways. - Ginger is commonly considered as a kind of pain killer. - Ginger warms people's bodies and helps them recover from operations. - Ginger has no harmful side effects according to a large amount of medical research.

What might be the first step of the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"The first step of the process outlined is the cooling of magma. Magma is essentially molten rock found beneath the Earth's surface. It is formed when the temperature and pressure within the Earth's mantle cause the solid rock to melt. This molten material is called magma, and it is primarily composed of silicate minerals containing varying amounts of dissolved gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other volatile compounds. The formation and movement of magma are closely related to the movement of tectonic plates and volcanic activity. Once magma has been generated beneath the Earth's surface, it may either rise towards the surface due to buoyancy forces or cool and crystallize within the crust itself. As the magma cools down, the minerals within it begin to solidify and form crystals. The rate at which the magma cools has a significant impact on the texture and composition of the resulting igneous rock. Faster cooling results in the formation of fine-grained rocks with small crystals, whereas slower cooling allows for the development of coarser-grained rocks with larger crystals. After the igneous rock has been formed, various external forces, such as weathering, erosion, and transport, break down the solid rock into smaller fragments or sediments. These sediments can be deposited in various environments, such as rivers, lakes, and oceans, where they eventually become compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks can contain valuable information about past environments, as they may preserve fossils or other clues about the conditions under which they were formed. Over time, these sedimentary rocks may be subjected to significant heat and/or pressure due to the ongoing movement of tectonic plates. Such activity may result in the transformation of sedimentary rocks into metamorphic rocks, which have a distinctly different texture and mineral composition compared to their sedimentary precursors. The intensity and duration of heat and pressure to which these rocks are exposed determine the extent of metamorphism they undergo. Finally, under sufficient heat and pressure, metamorphic rocks may begin to melt, returning once again to a molten state and completing the rock cycle. This process highlights the dynamic nature of the Earth's lithosphere and demonstrates how rocks are continuously being formed, altered, and recycled over time. In summary, the first step in the process described is the cooling of magma, leading to the formation of igneous rocks. This serves as the starting point for the rock cycle, which encompasses the various stages of rock formation, modification, and recycling that occur within the Earth's crust."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is bordered by the state of New York to the west and south, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the northeast and north, respectively. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast, and Long Island Sound is to the south. Boston is its largest city. Its largest metropolitan area is Greater Boston, which also includes Worcester (the second-largest city in New England), Manchester (the largest city in New Hampshire), and Providence (the capital and largest city of Rhode Island), with nearly a third of the entire region's population.  - Wood is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees, and other woody plants. It is an organic material, a natural composite of cellulose fibers which are strong in tension embedded in a matrix of lignin which resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs. In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber.  - A roof is part of a building envelope. It is the covering on the uppermost part of a building or shelter which provides protection from animals and weather, notably rain or snow, but also heat, wind and sunlight. The word also denotes the framing or structure which supports that covering.  - Essex County is a county in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Massachusetts. As of the 2010 census, the population was 743,159, making it the third-most populous county in Massachusetts. It is part of the Greater Boston area (the BostonCambridgeNewton, MANH Metropolitan Statistical Area). The largest city in Essex County is Lynn.   - The Capt. Peter Rice House is a historic First Period house at 377 Elm Street in Marlborough , Massachusetts . The oldest portion of this house , a two - room section , dates to 1688 , and was built by Peter Rice around the time of his marriage to Rebecca Howe . It was expanded over the 18th century to its present configuration , a five - bay 2 - 1/2 story saltbox with a large central chimney . The house now serves as the headquarters of the Marlborough Historical Society . The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 .  - In colonial American architecture and design, the First Period was the time period of approximately 1626 through 1725. There are more houses constructed by America's earliest settlers in Essex County, Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country. Its successor is the Colonial Georgian Period.  - Marlborough (often spelled Marlboro) is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 38,499 at the 2010 census. Marlborough became a prosperous industrial town in the 19th century and made the transition to high technology industry in the late 20th century after the construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike.  - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.  - A chimney is a structure that provides ventilation for hot flue gases or smoke from a boiler, stove, furnace or fireplace to the outside atmosphere. Chimneys are typically vertical, or as near as possible to vertical, to ensure that the gases flow smoothly, drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack, or chimney, effect. The space inside a chimney is called a \\"flue\\". Chimneys may be found in buildings, steam locomotives and ships. In the United States, the term smokestack (colloquially, stack) is also used when referring to locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys, and the term funnel can also be used.  - The Massachusetts Turnpike (locally called the Mass Pike or the Pike) is a toll road in Massachusetts, maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). Spanning , the highway constitutes the easternmost portion of Interstate 90 (I-90); it begins near Logan International Airport at the eastern border of Boston and becomes part of the New York State Thruway at the Berkshire Connector in Canaan, New York, where I-90 continues towards its western terminus in Seattle, Washington. The turnpike traverses the state, and connects Boston with the major cities of Springfield and Worcester.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - A saltbox house is a traditional New England style of house with a long, pitched roof that slopes down to the back, generally a wooden frame house. A saltbox has just one story in the back and two stories in the front. The flat front and central chimney are recognizable features, but the asymmetry of the unequal sides and the long, low rear roof line are the most distinctive features of a saltbox, which takes its name from its resemblance to a wooden lidded box in which salt was once kept.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Mike is studying for his physics exam. He realizes that the best way to learn physics is to solve problems. To that end, he needs to to convert pressure of objects from one unit to another. In one problem, four scenarios are given for the same object, scenario A, scenario B, scenario C, and scenario D. In scenario A the pressure is given in Pascals. In scenario B the pressure is given in the atm. In scenario C the pressure is given in torr. Lastly, in scenario D the pressure is given in psi.  But I can use this background: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units.  What is an answer for this question: Which scenario's unit would most likely be used in everyday world, scenario A or scenario D? The answer is:","output":"Scenario D would most likely be used in everyday world because it deals with the pressure unit psi (pounds per square inch). Unlike Pascals, which are used primarily in scientific and engineering contexts, psi is commonly used for pressure measurements in everyday situations, such as tire pressure, air pressure in sports balls, and water pressure in household plumbing systems. While Pascals are the SI (International System of Units) unit for pressure and are more precise for scientific calculations, most people do not encounter them regularly in their daily lives. Scenario A, which deals with pressure in Pascals, would be less likely to be used in everyday scenarios. On the other hand, scenario D, which involves pressure in psi, would be more relatable and comprehensible for most people, making it more likely to be encountered in everyday life. Although neither psi nor torr (from scenario C) are SI units, they serve as practical and convenient pressure units for non-scientific applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 2: Cottonwoods are dormant during the fall.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What happens to cottonwoods when the days get shorter?\\" with the following options:  - They bloom  - They go dormant  - Dehydration  - It helps them survive  - Exfoliation  - They die  - They reproduce  - They may not survive. Answer:","output":"When the days get shorter, cottonwoods go dormant. This is a natural response observed in many plants, including cottonwoods, as they adapt to changing environmental conditions each season. Dormancy is a period of reduced metabolic activity that allows the plant to conserve energy during times when it may be less favorable for growth and reproduction, such as during the colder temperature and shorter days in the fall and winter months. Several factors contribute to the dormancy of cottonwoods. As daylight becomes less available, the trees receive fewer signals from the sun which trigger growth and various physiological processes. Additionally, the temperature drop in the fall months causes a slowing of metabolic reactions within the plant. These factors, combined with the diminishing availability of water due to the colder temperatures, create conditions that are less conducive to growth and reproduction. Dormancy provides cottonwoods and other plants with the ability to survive through harsh conditions until more favorable weather returns in the spring. During dormancy, the metabolic activities within the plant are greatly reduced, allowing it to survive on the limited resources it has stored during the previous growing season. This pause in growth and reproduction ensures that the plant conserves energy, which will then be available for the tree to resume active growth once the longer days and warmer temperatures return. In conclusion, when the days get shorter, cottonwoods go dormant as a response to the changing environmental conditions. This process helps the trees to conserve energy and better manage scarce resources, ensuring their survival until favorable conditions return in the spring."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Attorneys... (Associated Press)      The fatal shooting of Jones, 55, and 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier, a college student visiting his father for the holiday, at a West Side home has raised further questions about a police department already under intense scrutiny. Grieving relatives and friends of the two victims gathered Sunday to remember them and criticize city officials who they said had once again failed residents.      The shooting happened early Saturday morning at the small two-story home, where Jones lived in a ground-floor apartment and LeGrier's father in an upstairs unit. Police, who were responding to a 911 call made by LeGrier's father after an argument with his son, have released few details beyond a brief statement.      It said that officers \\"were confronted by a combative subject resulting in the discharging of the officer's weapon\\" and added that Jones \\"was accidentally struck.\\"      Both Jones and LeGrief were black, and their deaths come amid scrutiny of police after a series of deaths of African-Americans at the hands of officers across the country gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. It also comes amid a federal civil rights investigation into the Chicago Police Department that was launched after last month's release of police dashcam video showing white officer Jason Van Dyke shooting black 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times in 2014.      Police did not disclose the race of the officer or officers, saying only that those involved will be placed on administrative duties.      LeGrier's mother, Janet Cooksey, during a vigil Sunday placed candles on the porch of the home. On either side of the door, Post-It notes indicated where two bullets hit siding on the house.      \\"I used to watch the news daily and I would grieve for other mothers, other family members, and now today I'm grieving myself,\\" Cooksey said at a news conference outside the residence earlier Sunday.      Others who spoke said police should have used stun guns or other nonlethal methods if they felt they needed to subdue LeGrier.      \\"Why do (police) have to shoot first and ask questions later?\\" Jacqueline Walker, a friend of Jones, asked. \\"It's ridiculous.\\"      Family spokesman Eric Russell said Jones' many grandchildren had hoped to thank her for their Christmas gifts over the weekend.      Autopsy findings released Sunday by the Cook County medical examiner's office say Jones died from a gunshot to the chest and LeGrier from multiple gunshot wounds.      Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi on Sunday said only that the shootings are being investigated by the city's Independent Police Review Authority, the main police oversight agency.      LeGrier's cousin, Albert Person, said LeGrier's father had invited his son to a holiday gathering at another home on Christmas. Person said the son's refusal to go caused friction, but he downplayed the severity of the argument.      \\"What family doesn't fight on the holidays?\\" he said.      LeGrier's father, Antonio LeGrier, told the Chicago Sun-Times his son appeared to be a \\"little agitated\\" when the father returned to the apartment. Around 4:15 a.m., the elder LeGrier said he heard loud banging on his locked bedroom door and that his son said, \\"You're not going to scare me.\\" He said his son tried to bust the door open, but he kept him from doing so and called police. He added that he called Jones on the floor below to say his son was a \\"little irate\\" and not to open the door unless police arrived.      He said Jones told him his son was outside with a baseball bat. Person said the teen was back in the house by the time police arrived.      When they did arrive, Antonio LeGrier said he heard Jones yell, \\"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\\" He said he heard gunshots as he made his way down from the second floor and then saw his son and Jones lying in the foyer.      He said his son had emotional problems after spending most of his childhood in foster care. He described him as a \\"whiz kid\\" on break from Northern Illinois University, where he majored in electrical engineering technology.      Cooksey denied that her son ever exhibited \\"combative behavior.\\" She said he \\"might've been angry with his father and they might've got into it,\\" but that he was not angry or violent.      It's not clear whether Jones tried to intervene before being shot or if she was hit by gunfire while answering the door.      Sam Adam Jr., a lawyer for the Jones family, said Jones and LeGrier were apparently shot near the doorway of the home, but that shell casings were found some 20 feet away. He said that raised questions about whether police could have perceived LeGrier as a threat at such a distance.      It couldn't be independently verified that the casings had any link to Saturday's shooting.      Adam also said police took the hard drive of a home-security camera from across the street, but it was unknown if it or other cameras in the neighborhood captured the shootings.      Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office said in a statement Saturday that IPRA would share its evidence with the county prosecutor's office.      \\"Anytime an officer uses force the public deserves answers, and regardless of the circumstances, we all grieve anytime there is a loss of life in our city,\\" Emanuel said in the statement. ||||| As questions grow about a police-involved shooting where a 55-year-old bystander was killed, the City of Chicago announced what the mayor’s office called “two significant policy steps,” related to police shootings and procedures for interceding in domestic violence situations. NBC 5's Phil Rogers reports. (Published Monday, Dec 28, 2015)      As questions grow about a police-involved shooting where a 55-year-old bystander was killed, the City of Chicago announced what the mayor’s office called “two significant policy steps,” related to police shootings and procedures for interceding in domestic violence situations.      Saturday morning, 55-year-old Bettie Jones was shot and killed in a flurry of gunfire directed at a 19-year-old-man armed with a baseball bat at a two story home on Chicago’s west side. That man, Quentonio LeGrier, also died, shot seven times.      “She didn’t do anything to nobody,” said Jones’ daughter Latisha. “All she did was answer her front door!”      Chicago Police have given few details about the incident, saying that the officers were responding to a 911 call made by LeGrier’s father, after an argument with his son. Police said in a statement, that arriving officers were confronted by a “combative subject resulting in the discharging of the officer’s weapon,” and that “the female victim was accidentally struck.”      “I feel like I just want to wake up and have my mom say, ‘Girl, that was a dream,’” said Jones daughter Latarsha. “But I can’t. She’s gone. She was murdered.”      Effective immediately, the city says officers involved in shootings will be removed from street duty for a minimum of 30 days while those shootings are investigated.      “I was really pleased to see that,” said Sharon Fairley, the acting chief of the Independent Police Review Authority, the agency responsible for investigating police shootings. “I definitely think that’s a step in the right direction.”      Fairley acknowledged public dissatisfaction with the length of time many police shooting investigations can take. But she defended her agency’s work, saying it was most important that those investigations were done correctly.      “These matters are always serious,” she said. “These investigations can be extremely complex, and there can be valid reasons that they can be extended in time.”      At the same time, Fairly acknowledged that she is stepping into leadership at IPRA, at a time when public outrage over police shootings may be at an all-time high.      “It’s a lot of pressure, there’s no question,” she said. “Stepping into this job at this time in this firestorm, it certainly isn’t easy. But I have to put all that aside and focus on the work and getting the work done.”      Attorney Sam Adam Jr., who represents Jones’ family, questioned why it was necessary for police to fire at a subject armed only with a baseball bat.      “The shell casings, many of them, are found down by the street on the sidewalk, which would suggest that is at least 25 feet away,” Adam said.      In an obvious reference to the domestic investigation where the two were shot early Saturday morning, the mayor’s office announced in a statement Monday that the city would embark on a complete review of crisis intervention policies.      “The Mayor has called on them to determine the deficiencies in the current training or policies,” that statement said, “and outline what steps can be taken immediately to address them.”      Emanuel’s office announced Monday he was cutting a Cuban vacation short, to return to Chicago and manage the latest crisis confronting his Police Department. Fairley would not comment specifically about the investigation into the Saturday morning shootings, emphasizing instead, that she has embarked in a top to bottom review of her agency and its investigations into allegations of police wrongdoing.      “I’m not about finger pointing,” she said. “What I’m focused on, is how are we going to fix it? What are the policies and procedures and training that we can put in place, to get the ship going in the right direction?” ||||| A definitive statement from the Chicago Police Department about an officer's fatal shooting of two people — one by accident — came Saturday night, 16 hours after the incident.      But when it did arrive, the comments from interim Superintendent John Escalante were notable. In the late-evening press release, Escalante not only announced a major policy shift on returning officers to duty after a shooting, he also took the unusual step to acknowledge that an innocent victim had been hit by an errant police bullet.      \\"The 55-year-old female victim was accidentally struck and tragically killed,\\" the statement read. \\"The department extends its deepest condolences to the victim's family and friends.\\"      In contrast, the 2012 department statement on the fatal shooting of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd, who was also an unintended target of a police shooting, simply noted that a female had \\"sustained a gunshot wound.\\"      Both the policy announcement and Escalante's condolences reflect the emerging reality for the Chicago Police Department in the wake of last month's release of video of a white police officer fatally shooting an African-American teen. The disturbing 2014 dash-cam video showed 17-year-old Laquan McDonald carrying a pocket knife and walking away from Officer Jason Van Dyke, who shot 16 rounds at the teen within seconds of arriving at the scene and now faces first-degree murder charges.      The video, which was released only after a judge's order, has led to swift — even dizzying — changes. The U.S. Justice Department has launched a civil rights investigation into excessive force. Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy was fired, and the head of the independent agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct was forced out. Mayor Rahm Emanuel publicly apologized.      The shooting about 4:30 a.m. Saturday in the 4700 block of West Erie Street was the department's first lethal use of force since the McDonald video was released, providing a glimpse of how it is responding to the biggest crisis of Emanuel's tenure in office.      Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Sunday that Escalante and his command staff had started working on the policy change a week and a half ago. But in the wake of learning details from the West Side shooting, Escalante insisted the statement acknowledge the accidental killing of Bettie Jones, Guglielmi said.      Chicago police fatally shot Quintonio LeGrier, 19, and Bettie Jones, 55, as officers responded to a domestic disturbance at a West Garfield Park residence Dec. 26, 2015, authorities said.      \\"It was a tragic loss of life. The superintendent was adamant that the department express our deepest condolences,\\" Guglielmi said. \\"... The climate we are in is causing us to look at this. We are really trying to make the department better.\\"      In the Saturday shooting on Erie, Harrison District officers were responding to a domestic violence call of a man wielding a bat.      Police shot and killed Quintonio LeGrier, a 19-year-old engineering student, after he became combative with them, the Chicago police statement said. During the altercation, Bettie Jones, 55, a mother of five who lived downstairs from LeGrier's father, was shot and killed by accident.      Hours after the West Side incident, Chicago police were involved in yet another shooting, though this one nonfatal. At 1:30 p.m. in the 1000 block of West 103rd Place, officers confronted a man with a gun, leading one officer to open fire, wounding the man.      Such confrontations with the public are the focus of the Justice Department civil rights investigation, which was announced earlier this month by U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch.      The probe will include a detailed examination of how and when officers use force in the department, as well as how the city investigates the incidents.      The investigation was prompted by the McDonald shooting but comes after years of civil lawsuits against the department and outcries from the public over police-involved shootings.      The review is expected to be lengthy, taking at least a year, and will likely lead to a court-enforced consent decree demanding systemic reforms. Recommended changes could cover anything from training to how firearm discharges are recorded and documented in the department.      But Chicago doesn't have to wait for the Justice Department review to address problems, and Escalante has already made some moves aimed at restoring public confidence.      Soon after Escalante took over as interim superintendent, he announced a policy change on dashboard cameras. Because there was missing audio in the dashboard cameras from responding vehicles the night of McDonald's shooting, Escalante has sent out inspectors on random checks to see if the dash cams are working property. If an inspector finds that an officer didn't tell a supervisor about a faulty camera, that officer could be disciplined.      Then on Saturday night, the interim superintendent announced another policy change: Officers involved in shootings will be shifted to mandatory administrative duty, returning to their assigned bureau for desk duty for 30 days. The new policy includes the officer or officers involved in Saturday's shooting, according to the police statement.      That is a big shift from the current policy in which officers generally had three days to see a counselor and be cleared for return to duty unless it was determined that they need more time off. Officers were also required to report for a one-day retraining at the academy — though that could happen after they returned to duty.      During the newly established 30-day period, the officer will be required to attend the training class at the academy, commanding officers will monitor and evaluate if the officer is prepared to return to street duties, and the officer will have to see a department counselor.      Guglielmi said Escalante reviewed other cities' departments and settled on the 30 days because \\"it seemed like a fair amount of time to get all those objectives done.\\"      Providing officers with time off following a shooting is not unusual. It is considered essential to making sure an officer is coping with any psychological issues in the aftermath of the incident and is getting whatever support he or she needs. Getting the proper help for officers is not an easy task in a profession where admitting weakness has historically been frowned upon. ||||| Tensions remain high in Chicago after police shot and killed two people early Saturday morning, with the force already faces heightened scrutiny overs its practices.      Janet Cooksey says her 19-year-old son, Quintonio LeGrier, was a college honors student studying engineering who recently had been dealing with some mental health issues, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner.      Family members reportedly called police to their home Saturday because the teen was threatening his father with a baseball bat. Detectives described LeGrier as being \\"combative\\" before he was shot.      \\"I used to watch the news daily and I would grieve for other mothers, other family members, and now today I'm grieving myself,\\" said Janet Cooksey, LeGrier's mother. \\"When do it come to an end?\\"      Fifty-five-year-old Bettie Jones, a mother of five, lived in the same building. She was reportedly waiting for police to respond, then got shot along with LeGrier.      Police admitted she was quote \\"accidentally struck and tragically killed.\\"      \\"Right now is a time for compassion towards the suffering of families that are experiencing injustices throughout our city,\\" Jahmal Cole, a Jones relative, said Sunday at a press conference.      The frustration felt by this community comes amid protests over a string of deadly police shootings.      Video released recently showed the death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, shot by officer Jason Van Dyke 16 times in October of 2014. The officer faces criminal charges.      On Sunday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel called for a review of how police are trained to respond to mental health issues in a crisis.      But family, friends and local religious leaders holding a vigil for LeGrier and Jones were critical of Emanuel's efforts - some now even asking for intervention from the White House.      \\"We hope to hear from the president, President Obama -- we are under siege,\\" said Pastor Ira Acree of the Greater St. John Bible Church.      This incident was one of two separate police-involved shooting incidents Saturday. Chicago's independent police review board is investigating both, while the Justice Department continues to investigate whether the Chicago police use excessive force appropriately. ||||| Summary:","output":"Chicago police are under intense scrutiny following the fatal shooting of 55-year-old Bettie Jones and 19-year-old college student, Quintonio LeGrier, during a domestic disturbance on 26 December. Both victims were black and the incident has further fuelled the debate around the conduct of police officers and the Chicago Police Department, which is already under a federal civil rights investigation. Questions are now being raised over why the police did not use non-lethal methods in their confrontation with LeGrier, and why they felt they needed to shoot in the first place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Why is the sky sometimes very bright at night in the winter? Why sometimes at night sky looks brown in colour? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"1. Why is the sky sometimes very bright at night in the winter? The sky can be very bright at night during the winter for several reasons, including: A. Snow cover: In the winter, snow may be covering the ground. Snow is highly reflective, meaning that it effectively reflects and scatters sunlight and artificial light from the surroundings. When sunlight bounces off the snow and back into the sky, it can create a brighter night sky. B. Shorter days and longer nights: In winter, days are shorter because the Earth is tilted away from the sun at a sharper angle. This means that nights are longer in winter, giving our eyes more time to adapt to the low levels of light. Due to dark adaptation, our eyes become more sensitive in the darkness, which can make even small amounts of light appear brighter. C. Light pollution: Light pollution is the excessive or misdirected artificial light from streetlights, buildings, and other sources. During winter nights, since people tend go indoors earlier, more artificial lights are turned on, increasing the light pollution. This additional light can also contribute to the brightness of the night sky. D. Atmospheric conditions: Clear and cold winter nights often provide the best conditions for light to travel without being scattered by particles in the atmosphere. This increased atmospheric clarity can make the night sky seem brighter because both natural and artificial light sources can appear more intense. 2. Why sometimes at night sky looks brown in colour? The night sky may appear brown in color due to factors such as: A. Light pollution: Light pollution from artificial sources like streetlights, outdoor signs, and buildings can make the sky appear brown. This is because the artificial light is typically orange-yellow in color and, when it disperses into the atmosphere, it creates a brownish or reddish hue. B. Air pollution and particulates: Air pollution from aerosols, dust, and smoke scattering light can produce a brownish hue in the night sky. These pollutants absorb and scatter light in a way that can make the sky look brown. C. Color perception: The human eye is more sensitive to certain colors (like green and red) than to others (like blue) under low-light conditions. Consequently, when observing the night sky, this color sensitivity, combined with light pollution and air pollution, can cause the sky to appear brown or reddish. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? No, these questions are not paraphrases of each other. While both questions pertain to the appearance and color of the night sky, they address different phenomena. The first question explores why the sky may appear brighter at night during winter, considering factors such as snow cover, shorter days and longer nights, light pollution, and atmospheric conditions. The second question seeks to understand why the night sky may appear brown, focusing on light pollution, air pollution, and color perception. This question is more concerned with the color of the sky rather than its brightness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, expressing the feeling may have negative consequences in terms of straining the relationship or potentially making the boyfriend feel guilty. For action (B), it involves asking a couple to pay their \\"fair share,\\" which presumably means asking them to contribute fairly in a financial situation. This action implies that there is a sense of fairness that is not being met, and it aims to address this inequality. Comparing these options, action (A) seems to center around the negative emotions of a person who is upset because their partner is prioritizing other family members. Action (B), on the other hand, tries to address perceived unfairness and equalize contributions, promoting fairness and balance.

Given the question: Do you think hard work can make anything possible? If you don't, you may want to read the book We Can Do written by Moshe Kai Cavalin. It might change your mind. Moshe Kai Cavalin is a 14-year-old American boy. He is about to graduate from UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) this year. Before that, he had already gotten a degree   from East Los Angeles Community College in 2009. Recently, Cavalin published   the book We Can Do. In this book, he talks about how to achieve things we want, by keeping yourself focused   and trying your best to do everything. He says this doesn't need genius  , just hard work. Cavalin says being called a genius \\"has always bothered   me... People need to know they don't have to be geniuses; they just need to work hard and they can achieve anything. If I can reach the stars, others can reach the Milky Way(,).\\" The idea of writing a book came from a teacher named Richard Avila at his first college. Cavalin says Avila inspired   him to write a book to explain how he succeeded, so he could inspire other people. It took Cavalin four years to finish the book. Because his mother is Chinese, she wanted to publish the book in Chinese. So Cavalin translated the book into Chinese by himself. The book did well in Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. Cavalin owes   his success to the following EXCEPT that   _  . A) he can focus on one thing B) he has tried his best to do things C) he was born a genius D) he worked hard at his dream The answer is:","output":"C) he was born a genius As per the provided information, Moshe Kai Cavalin emphasizes that his achievements are not because he was born a genius, but rather they are a result of his hard work, dedication, and ability to focus on his goals. In his book \\"We Can Do,\\" Cavalin shares his insights on how to achieve one's goals and dreams through determination and perseverance, and he makes it clear that being a genius is not a prerequisite to success. Instead, he believes that anyone can achieve exceptional results by simply working hard and staying focused on their objectives.  Cavalin's story serves as a reminder that hard work can make anything possible, as it is the driving force behind his accomplishments, such as graduating from UCLA at the age of 14, getting a degree from East Los Angeles Community College, and writing and translating his book to inspire others. In light of this, his success can indeed be attributed to his ability to focus on one thing, trying his best to do everything, and working hard at his dream.

Children kick a football around for fun. When they get older and play for local school teams, they become competitive but they still enjoy playing. The individual representing his country cannot afford to think about enjoying himself; he has to think only about winning. He is responsible for the entire nation's hopes, dreams and reputation. A good example is the football Word Cup. Football is the world's most important sport. Winning the World Cup is perhaps the summit of international sporting success. Mention Argentina   to someone and the chances are that he'll think of football. In a sense, winning the World Cup put Argentina on the map. Sports fans and supporters get quite _ about the World Cup. People in England felt that their country was somehow important after they won in 1966. Last year thousands of Scots sold their cars, and even their houses, and spent all their money traveling to Argentina, where the finals were played. So, am I arguing that international competition kills the idea of sport? Certainly not!

Question: Given the following passage  \\"A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself.

Choices:  - ecological succession  - fossil record  - cataclysmic time scale  - geologic time scale  A: Answer:","output":"Geologic Time Scale Based on the given paragraph, scientists use the geologic time scale to illustrate the order in which events on Earth have happened. The geologic time scale is a system of chronological measurements and dating that relates geological strata to time. It provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the sequence of events, processes, and changes that have occurred on our planet throughout its approximately 4.6 billion-year history. The geologic time scale is divided into several units called eons, eras, periods, and epochs, which help scientists study and analyze Earth's geological, biological, and climatic history more conveniently. These divisions are based on significant events, such as the appearance of different life forms, mass extinctions, and major shifts in climate. The four primary eons of the geologic time scale, from oldest to youngest, are: Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic. The Phanerozoic Eon is further subdivided into three eras: Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. Each era is further divided into periods, such as the Cambrian Period in the Paleozoic Era or the Jurassic Period in the Mesozoic Era, and some periods are divided into epochs. Major factors that contribute to the construction of the geologic time scale include the study of rock layers and their respective stratigraphy, the analysis of fossils (which help with relative dating), and radiometric dating techniques (which allow for more accurate absolute dating). By combining these methods, scientists can create a detailed chronological map of Earth's history that includes the timing of geological events, the development and extinction of species, and the natural processes that have shaped the planet's landforms and climate. In summary, the geologic time scale serves as a key tool for scientists to understand and communicate the chronology and complex history of Earth's events. It combines a variety of methods to create a detailed and comprehensive picture of the interactions between geologic processes, the evolution of life, and changes in climate that have occurred over time. Thus, it plays a crucial role in various domains of Earth sciences, such as geology, paleontology, and climatology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

At the White House on Wednesday, Trump continued to speak cautiously about the coming summit, even while praising the North Korean leader for the prisoner release. “Everything can be scuttled,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of things can happen — a lot of good things can happen, [and] a lot of bad things can happen.” North Korea on Wednesday granted amnesty to three Americans of Korean descent. They had been accused of espionage or trying to overthrow the government, charges widely seen as bogus. Pyongyang has detained at least 16 Americans over the past two decades, often attempting to use them as bargaining chips. All were eventually released, although Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, died shortly after returning to the United States last year. A White House statement Wednesday praised North Korea’s latest prisoner release as a “positive gesture of goodwill” ahead of the Trump-Kim summit, which is expected to take place as soon as next month. South Korea’s presidential office said Pyongyang’s decision was a “very positive” sign for a successful North Korea-U.S. meeting.  The freeing of the prisoners coincided with a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who declined to say whether the release was a U.S. precondition for holding talks with the North. “I don’t know the answer to that,” Pompeo told reporters on the flight home. “It would have been more difficult [had the prisoners not been released]. ... I’m glad that we don’t have to confront that.” It’s not clear what, if anything, the U.S. gave up in exchange for the prisoners. It’s not even clear a concession was needed, since North Korea has for decades sought the presumed legitimacy provided by a summit with a sitting U.S. president. after the story ends does Pyongyang take more prisoners?

Nick Rivers, an American rock star, travels to East Germany (which is represented as like Hitler's regime) to perform at a cultural festival, which secretly serves the East German government as a diversion for a military operation with the intent of reuniting Germany under their rule. At a dinner, Nick encounters Hillary Flammond, a member of the local resistance movement, attempting to avoid the authorities. He pretends to be her date to get to know her, and performs an impromptu song and dance, mistakenly thinking he was asked to do so, to the delight of Hillary and the diners but to the annoyance of General Streck, the mastermind of the \\"reunification\\" plot. Nick later sees Hillary at a ballet, where she expects to rendezvous with the resistance leader but she is met by the police instead. Nick saves her and they try to escape, but Nick turns himself in so that Hillary can get away. He is taken to a prison where he is questioned and tortured, but he knows nothing and does not break. In an escape attempt, he ends up in the secret prison lab of Dr. Paul Flammond, a brilliant scientist developing the \\"Polaris naval mine\\", a device that can destroy the entire NATO submarine fleet as part of the government's plot.

Sung by Jagger, the song refers to the Devil, written in the first-person narrative, recounting atrocities committed throughout the history of humanity as if they were somehow \\"inspired\\" (or at least witnessed) by him. Although it has been deemed by some as \\"a homage\\", in reality, no admiration (or even sympathy, for that matter) is declared for the Devil in the song -other than his \\"own\\" request.

In January 2002, a dull star in an obscure constellation suddenly became 600,000 times more luminous than our Sun, temporarily making it the brightest star in our galaxy. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"When considering the linguistic integrity of any given sentence, we look at factors such as its grammatical correctness, its syntactical coherency, the semantic depth and precision, its readability, and its stylistic efficacy. Let’s analyze the given sentence, \\"In January 2002, a dull star in an obscure constellation suddenly became 600,000 times more luminous than our Sun, temporarily making it the brightest star in our galaxy\\" according to these different points. Firstly, looking at grammatical correctness, the sentence happens to be impeccable. It uses appropriate verb tenses (\\"became,\\" \\"making\\"), correct prepositions (\\"in,\\" \\"than,\\" \\"in\\"), the right form of the demonstrative pronoun (\\"it\\"), and is punctuated appropriately. Secondly, in terms of syntactical coherency, the sentence is logically structured and coherent. It begins with an introductory prepositional phrase about the time (\\"In January 2002\\"), it is followed by an independent clause \\"a dull star in an obscure constellation suddenly became 600,000 times more luminous than our Sun,\\" and ends with a participle phrase, which acts as an adverbial, modifying the entire preceding clause (\\"temporarily making it the brightest star in our galaxy\\").  The semantic depth and precision is appreciable too. The adjective 'dull' effectively communicates the pre-occurrence state of the star, while the adverb 'suddenly' creates a sense of sudden transformation, emphasizing the dramatic shift in brightness. The phrase '600,000 times more luminous than our Sun' stipulates a clear comparison that shows the magnanimity of the event. Finally, 'temporarily making it the brightest star in our galaxy' not only reflects the consequence of the event, but it also subtly informs that this phenomenal brightness was not permanent, indicating the transient nature of such cosmic events. As for readability, this sentence is clear, concise, and straightforward, thus it makes for easy comprehension. There are no overly complex terms, and the sentence employs an organized and logical structure. Considering stylistic efficacy, the sentence is quite effective and engaging. The choice of words such as 'dull' and 'obscure' add mood and tone to the sentence, which creates curiosity and sparks the interest of readers. Its descriptiveness pulls readers into a cosmic scenario where a seemingly unnoticeable star erupts into unmatched brightness—the narrative style therefore manages to convey impressiveness of the event. In conclusion, when we consider the linguistic integrity of the given sentence, it is safe to say that it is a well-formed, meaningful, clear, and stylistically impressive sentence. It demonstrates a high degree of competence in language usage, maintaining a balance between scientific conceptual clarity and narrative engagement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","output":"Yes, Shipping News and Gene are both rock bands, although they belong to different subgenres and have distinct musical styles, backgrounds, and timeframes within the rock music spectrum. Shipping News is an American post-rock band founded in 1996. The band finds its roots in Louisville, Kentucky, and is comprised of members Jeff Mueller (guitar, vocals), Jason Noble (guitar, vocals), Todd Cook (bass), and Kyle Crabtree (drums). Shipping News is associated with the '90s and early 2000s post-rock movement, which is characterized by the use of rock instrumentation to create expansive, atmospheric, and experimental soundscapes that often deviate from the traditional verse-chorus structure of popular rock songs. The band's music is influenced by the styles of post-rock pioneers such as Slint, Rodan, and June of 44. Shipping News has released several albums and EPs, including \\"Save Everything\\" (1997), \\"Very Soon, and in Pleasant Company\\" (2001), \\"Flies the Fields\\" (2005), and \\"One Less Heartless to Fear\\" (2010). Though their popularity may not have reached mainstream levels, the band is well-respected within the realm of post-rock and experimental music enthusiasts. On the other hand, Gene is a British indie rock band that emerged in the early '90s, with a sound often compared to that of The Smiths and elements of Britpop. Formed in London in 1993, the band's members consisted of Martin Rossiter (vocals), Steve Mason (guitar), Kevin Miles (bass), and Matt James (drums). Their debut album, \\"Olympian\\" (1995), received critical acclaim for its melodic songs and introspective lyrics, which resonated with a generation of young indie rock fans. Gene released a series of successful albums during the '90s and early 2000s, including \\"Drawn to the Deep End\\" (1997) and \\"Revelations\\" (1999). They enjoyed widespread popularity in the UK during their peak years, with several charting singles and albums. Ultimately, Gene disbanded in 2004, but their music continues to have a lasting influence on the British indie rock scene. In conclusion, Shipping News and Gene are both rock bands, but with different subgenres, musical styles, origins, and timeframes. Shipping News represents the experimental and atmospheric side of post-rock in the American context, while Gene embodies the melodic, introspective essence of British indie rock with some Britpop influence. Both bands have left their mark on the rock music landscape, though they appeal to different niches within the broader rock genre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted.

Which US state in 1907 was the last to declare Christmas a legal holiday? What is the answer?","output":"Oklahoma was the last US state to declare Christmas a legal holiday in 1907. Christmas was not always universally celebrated across the United States; in fact, many early American settlers had mixed views on the holiday. This was primarily due to the diverse range of religious beliefs held by immigrants arriving in the New World. During the 17th and 18th centuries, certain religious groups in the United States, such as the Puritans, regarded the celebration of Christmas as a decadent and unnecessary custom. In some parts of the country, particularly in New England, Christmas was banned and not observed as a public holiday. It wasn't until the 19th century that Christmas became more widely accepted and adopted in the United States. Over time, the popularity of Christmas grew, and many states started to declare it as a legal holiday. The first state to do so was Alabama in 1836. Slowly, other states followed suit. Oklahoma became the last state to recognize Christmas as a legal holiday in 1907, shortly after it achieved statehood on November 16 of the same year. The shift in public opinion towards the celebration of Christmas can be attributed to various factors. One significant influence was the influx of immigrants from Europe, who brought their Christmas customs and traditions with them. Additionally, the works of authors like Charles Dickens, particularly his famous tale, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" (published in 1843), contributed towards shaping the modern image of Christmas, with a focus on family gatherings, goodwill, and generosity. Publications such as Clement Clarke Moore's \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" (also known as \\"The Night Before Christmas\\") and the illustrations by Thomas Nast also played a significant role in popularizing Christmas customs, including the image of Santa Claus. By the beginning of the 20th century, Christmas had evolved into a major cultural event in the United States, embraced by a large majority of the population. Today, Christmas is a federal holiday in the United States, celebrated by millions of people every year, regardless of their religious affiliations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Myelin The insulation for axons in the nervous system is provided by glial cells, oligodendrocytes in the CNS, and Schwann cells in the PNS. Whereas the manner in which either cell is associated with the axon segment, or segments, that it insulates is different, the means of myelinating an axon segment is mostly the same in the two situations. Myelin is a lipid-rich sheath that surrounds the axon and by doing so creates a myelin sheath that facilitates the transmission of electrical signals along the axon. The lipids are essentially the phospholipids of the glial cell membrane. Myelin, however, is more than just the membrane of the glial cell. It also includes important proteins that are integral to that membrane. Some of the proteins help to hold the layers of the glial cell membrane closely together. The appearance of the myelin sheath can be thought of as similar to the pastry wrapped around a hot dog for “pigs in a blanket” or a similar food. The glial cell is wrapped around the axon several times with little to no cytoplasm between the glial cell layers. For oligodendrocytes, the rest of the cell is separate from the myelin sheath as a cell process extends back toward the cell body. A few other processes provide the same insulation for other axon segments in the area. For Schwann cells, the outermost layer of the cell membrane contains cytoplasm and the nucleus of the cell as a bulge on one side of the myelin sheath. During development, the glial cell is loosely or incompletely wrapped around the axon (Figure 12.13a). The edges of this loose enclosure extend toward each other, and one end tucks under the other. The inner edge wraps around the axon, creating several layers, and the other edge closes around the outside so that the axon is completely enclosed.

Here is a question about this article: When World War II started, tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of non-discrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years. What is the answer to this question: What event cause shipping activities to be suspended?","output":"The event that caused shipping activities to be suspended was the start of World War II."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Anaheim (pronounced ) is a city in Orange County, California, part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 336,265, making it the most populous city in Orange County and the 10th most populous city in California. Anaheim is the second largest city in Orange County in terms of land area (after Irvine) and is known for its theme parks, sports teams, and convention center.  - In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important defensive player, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer.  - In baseball and softball, a relief pitcher or reliever is a pitcher who enters the game after the starting pitcher is removed due to injury, ineffectiveness, fatigue, ejection, or for other strategic reasons, such as being substituted by a pinch hitter. Relief pitchers are further divided informally into various roles, such as closers, set-up relief pitchers, middle relief pitchers, left/right-handed specialists, and long relievers. Whereas starting pitchers usually rest several days before pitching in a game again due to the number of pitches thrown, relief pitchers are expected to be more flexible and typically pitch more games but with fewer innings pitched. A team's staff of relievers is normally referred to metonymically as a team's bullpen, which refers to the area where the relievers sit during games, and where they warm-up prior to entering the game.  - Lori Harrigan - Mack ( born September 5 , 1970 ) is an American , former collegiate All - American , right - handed hitting , left - handed softball pitcher originally from Anaheim , California . She was a three - time Olympic Champion as a member of the Team USA winning in 1996 , 2000 and 2004 . Harrigan played collegiately from 1989 -- 1992 at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas where she owns numerous records ; she is the Big West career leader in shutouts and innings pitched .  - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding.  - The International Softball Federation is the international governing body for the sport of softball. The ISF is a non-profit corporation recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and SportAccord (formerly the General Association of International Sports Federations).  - In baseball (hardball or softball), a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team. A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent's first batter of a game. A pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher. Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game, although their ability to do this depends on many factors, including effectiveness, stamina, health, and strategy.  - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S.  - Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to this primary duty, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket.  - The 2010 United States Census, (known as \\"Census 2010\\"), is the twenty-third and currently most recent United States national census. National Census Day, the reference day used for the census, was April 1, 2010. As part of a drive to increase the count's accuracy, 635,000 temporary enumerators were hired. The population of the United States was counted as 308,745,538, a 9.7% increase from the 2000 Census.  - The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) is a volunteer, non-profit organization based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It was founded in 1933 with a tournament held in Chicago that was organized by Leo Fischer and Michael J. Pauley. The following year the 1934 National Recreation Congress recognized the ASA. Shortly afterward the ASA was located in Newark, New Jersey. A world amateur softball tournament was held by the ASA at Chicago's Soldier Field that started on September 7, 1939. The ASA moved to Oklahoma City on January 1, 1966.  - In baseball, innings pitched (IP) are the number of innings a pitcher has completed, measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game. Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched. One out counts as one-third of an inning, and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning. Sometimes, the statistic is written 34.1, 72.2, or 91.0, for example, to represent innings, innings, and 91 innings exactly, respectively.  - A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair spurred interest in the game. The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) of America (founded 1933) governs the game in the United States and sponsors annual sectional and World Series championships. The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries, including the United States and Canada; before the WBSC was formed in 2013, the International Softball Federation filled this role. Women's fastpitch softball became a Summer Olympic sport in 1996, but it (and baseball) were dropped from the 2012 Games; they will be reinstated for the 2020 Games.  - An inning in baseball, softball, and similar games is the basic unit of play, consisting of two halves or frames, the \\"top\\" (first half) and the \\"bottom\\" (second half). In each half, one team bats until three outs are made, with the other team playing defense. A full game typically is scheduled for nine innings, although this may be shortened due to weather or extended in the event that the score is tied at the end of the scheduled innings.

His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrete works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. Zappa was born on December 21, 1940 in Baltimore, Maryland. His mother, Rosemarie (nee Collimore) was of Italian (Neapolitan and Sicilian) and French ancestry; his father, whose name was anglicized to Francis Vincent Zappa, was an immigrant from Partinico, Sicily, with Greek and Arab ancestry.  Frank, the eldest of four children, was raised in an Italian-American household where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical warfare facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home in case of an accident. This had a profound effect on Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.  Zappa was often sick as a child, suffering from asthma, earaches and sinus problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of radium into each of Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation, and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant enough evidence to confirm this.  Nasal imagery and references appear in his music and lyrics, as well as in the collage album covers created by his long-time collaborator Cal Schenkel. Zappa believed his childhood diseases might have been due to exposure to mustard gas, released by the nearby chemical warfare facility. His health worsened when he lived in Baltimore. In 1952, his family relocated for reasons of health. They next moved to Monterey, California, where his father taught metallurgy at the Naval Postgraduate School. They soon moved to Claremont, California, then to El Cajon, before finally settling in San Diego.

She could have written just ordinary routine notes of acknowledgement. But that was not her way. She sat down and wrote the woman in Toronto a real letter telling all about the village, and the names of the children who were wearing the knitted gloves and caps, and what they said when they got them, and how they looked when they wore them.

Process:  - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more gases build up under the earth happens, how will it affect MORE or GREATER eruptions.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this context, involves the supposition that an increased buildup of gases beneath the Earth's surface will lead to potential changes in the volcanic eruption process. To analyze the impacts of this perturbation on the process, we can break down the volcanic eruption process into specific stages and discuss how an increase in the buildup of gases may affect each stage. 1. Gases cause pressure beneath the Earth: The primary cause of volcanic eruptions is the accumulation of molten rock (magma) beneath the Earth's surface. As a result of various geological processes, gases begin to dissolve in this magma. These gases, primarily water vapor, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and smaller quantities of other gases, contribute to the overall pressure beneath the Earth. If more gases were to build up under the Earth's surface due to increased geological activity or other factors, the pressure beneath the Earth would increase at a faster rate. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface: As the pressure caused by the dissolved gases increases, it may reach a point where it is strong enough to break through the overlying rocks. In such cases, the increased pressure from the additional buildup of gases would lead to a more significant force acting on the magma and could result in more magma being pushed towards the Earth's surface. Consequently, larger volumes of magma may rise, potentially leading to more substantial volcanic eruptions. 3. The magma cools: Once the magma reaches the surface, it cools down and starts to solidify. With more gases building up beneath the Earth's surface, larger volumes of magma may reach the surface. As a result, it might take longer for the entire volume of magma to cool and solidify, which could lead to prolonged volcanic activity or a more extensive area being covered by cooled magma deposits. 4. With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly: Over time, the buildup of pressure beneath the Earth's surface continues to increase, primarily due to the continued accumulation of gases. In the context of the perturbation hypothesis, it is likely that greater amounts of gases would lead to the pressure building up more rapidly and reaching critical levels sooner compared to a lower gas buildup situation. This accelerated buildup could lead to more frequent volcanic eruptions. 5. The resulting volcano may explode: With enough pressure, a volcano may eventually erupt explosively. The increased buildup of gases would result in higher pressures beneath the Earth's surface, leading to a more significant likelihood of explosive volcanic eruptions. Additionally, these explosions may be more forceful and release more energy due to the increased gas pressure, causing more considerable damage and more extensive lava and ash production. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of increasing gas buildup beneath the Earth's surface has the potential to directly impact the volcanic eruption process. It could lead to larger volumes of magma being pushed towards the surface, increased likelihood of explosive eruptions, and more frequent and prolonged volcanic activities. This higher rate of volcanic eruptions and the more significant impact of each eruption could have major consequences on the environment, climate, and human activities. Therefore, understanding the factors contributing to increased gas buildup and monitoring volcanic activities becomes crucial in mitigating the risks associated with such perturbations."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

' what do you think they 're going to do with you ,","output":"Hugo, when they discover that you've betrayed them as well?\\" Hugo's face grew pale as a ghost, his expression drained of all its usual confidence. It was clear he had never given serious thought to the consequences of his actions. He had always been one to walk the line between the factions, each wary of his known loyalties yet willing to work with him for their own purposes. But now, his betrayal had put him in grave danger from all sides. The Fellowship would no doubt be out for blood, thirsty for revenge upon learning that someone they once considered their own had turned against them. And it wasn't just the vampires who would want to make an example out of Hugo; their allies, the werewolves, demons, and other creatures of the night, would also seek retribution. They would want to send a message to those who dared to defy them, that treachery would not be tolerated. The air in the dimly lit room grew colder, the tension so palpable it could be cut with a knife. Hugo's once confident façade had crumbled as the reality of his situation sank in. He knew he was in too deep, that there was no turning back. \\"You must understand, Hugo, not only have you sealed your own fate, but you've also endangered the lives of those around you. The Fellowship and its allies don't discriminate when it comes to extracting vengeance. Your colleagues, your friends... even your family... they may all become targets simply because they are linked to you.\\" For a moment, it seemed as though Hugo was struggling to find a way to rationalize the chaos he had brought into his life. As a skilled manipulator, he had always found ways to navigate the supernatural underworld by playing both sides, exploiting the weaknesses and desires of others to further his own goals. But now, he was quickly running out of options, and time. \\"What you must do now, Hugo, is find a way to atone for your actions. This path of betrayal and deceit that you've trodden upon has only led to suffering and inevitable ruin. The only way to possibly save yourself and those you care about is to make amends, to right the wrongs you've committed.\\" He looked at me with both doubt and desperation, weighing his options. \\"But how? What could I possibly do to make up for the mess I've made?\\" \\"Well, you can start by severing your ties with both sides, the Fellowship and the vampires. Promise yourself never to return to the world of darkness and manipulation that you've become a part of. Then, you should seek allies from outside the shadows, those who genuinely want to bring peace and harmony between humans and supernaturals.\\" I could see the wheels turning in Hugo's mind, as he pondered my words in silence. But time was of the essence, and he needed to make a decision soon. The storm was brewing, and it would not be long before it descended upon him and everything he held dear. \\"Choose your path wisely, Hugo, for it will determine not only your fate but that of countless others. There are forces larger than yourself at play, and your actions could greatly impact the balance and the safety of our world.\\" With that, I left Hugo to ponder his next move, hoping that he would choose the path of redemption rather than continuing down that treacherous road that could all but guarantee his destruction. But in the end, the choice was his to make, and only time would reveal the true extent of the consequences his actions would bear upon our world."},{"instruction":"Question: Q: When a stalactite and stalagmite join together, they form a what?

Write an article using the following points: Prime Minister George Papandreou will seek a vote of confidence Thursday. At least 25,000 turn out to keep lawmakers from debating budget-cutting measures. The protests against the austerity turn violent, with gasoline bombs and tear gas. Greece is getting international help to deal with its budget deficit.","output":"Title: Greek Prime Minister Seeks Confidence Vote Amid Protests and Austerity Measures Introduction: Prime Minister George Papandreou of Greece is set to seek a vote of confidence from the parliament on Thursday, in the midst of a tense political and economic situation in the country. Thousands of protesters have gathered in the streets to express their anger and opposition to the government's budget-cutting measures. As the situation escalates, international help arrives to address Greece's budget deficit. 1. Prelude to the confidence vote: On Thursday, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou will attempt to secure a vote of confidence from the parliament. This move comes amidst a period of heightened tension between the ruling government and the Greek population, who are expressing their discontent with the government's stringent austerity measures. This confidence vote is critical for the government's ability to push through their proposed budget cuts and maintain political stability. 2. Mass protests break out: At least 25,000 protestors have turned out to voice their opposition to the proposed budget-cutting measures, putting pressure on lawmakers who are set to debate these issues. The protests signify the growing discontent within Greece and highlight the general public's resistance to any further austerity measures that are being proposed by the government. 3. Escalation of violence during protests: The protests have turned violent, with gasoline bombs being thrown and tear gas being used to disperse the crowds. Such events have undoubtedly added to the tension and unease surrounding the confidence vote. 4. International assistance to tackle Greece's budget deficit: As Greece struggles to deal with its budget deficit, international help has been mobilized in an attempt to provide the necessary support. It is hoped that this assistance will help Greece to overcome its economic challenges and restore faith in the government's ability to manage the nation's finances. Conclusion: Thursday's confidence vote for Prime Minister George Papandreou will undoubtedly be a significant moment in the ongoing Greek political and economic crisis. With thousands of protestors taking to the streets to voice their anger against proposed austerity measures, the situation in Greece remains precarious. As violence escalates and international assistance is sought, the country's leaders will be under immense pressure to find a solution that appeases both the nation's financial needs and its population's concerns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I was told that it was impossible to do because even though we had the rolling stock, we did not have the ability to deal with a union that had the opportunity to charge double time, triple time and all kinds of things on a train that was going across the country for two or three days. Can we draw the following conclusion? Only single time can be charged.","output":"From the information given, we cannot necessarily draw the conclusion that only single time can be charged. The statement offers multiple points to consider, so let's break it down and analyze it thoroughly. The scenario being discussed involves a train going across the country for several days. While there is the availability of rolling stock (railway vehicles like wagons or coaches), the main concern expressed is the inability to deal with the union which may charge higher rates based on specific circumstances. The statement appears to find issue with the union potentially charging double time and triple time for certain periods during the train's journey. Double time and triple time are terms referring to charging twice or three times the regular rate, respectively. These are usually applied when employees are required to work overtime, on holidays, or during weekends. These rates are meant to compensate employees for working extended hours or giving up personal time to meet business demands. It is important to note that the statement does not claim that such rates are unjustified or unreasonable; instead, the concern lies in not having the ability to deal with the expenses these union-imposed rates may incur. This suggests that the train operating company might not have the financial resources or negotiated arrangements in place to cover these increased costs. Therefore, the assumption that only single time can be charged is not entirely correct, given the context of this statement. The concern pertains to the potential for increased rates that companies may be unable to handle or negotiate, not the outright impossibility of charging double time, triple time, or other premium rates. In different situations or under different agreements, charging double time, triple time, or any other rate multiplier may very well be permissible and appropriate as part of a union labor agreement. It is also important to keep in mind that union agreements and labor laws governing work hours and pay rates can vary significantly by location and industry. What may be true for this specific train operating company may not necessarily apply universally across different organizations and contexts. So, while the statement highlights a key concern and challenge in this particular situation, the conclusion stating that only \\"single time can be charged\\" is not accurate without considering the broader context, possible alternative arrangements, or differing labor agreements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Inauguration Poster Likens Obama to Jesus Street vendors and souvenir stores across Washington, D.C. are selling posters depicting President Obama as Jesus Christ — and one national news publication called him the “Second Coming.” FOLLOW TODD ON FACEBOOK FOR CULTURE WAR NEWS. CLICK HERE! The poster, which does not have the official endorsement of the White House, features an image of the president in prayer with the headline, “Prophecy Fulfilled.” “Barak is of Hebrew origin and its meaning is ‘flash of lightning,” the poster notes, referencing a passage in in the Old Testament book of Judges. Hussein, they allege, is a Biblical word meaning “good and handsome.” “So you see, Barak was destined to be a good and handsome man that would rise like a flash of lightning to win victory in a battle against overwhelming odds,” the poster read. This week’s cover of Newsweek depicts President Obama as the “Second Coming” – a biblical reference to the return of Christ. It’s not the first time that Obama has been deified by his supporters. Actor Jamie Foxx called President Obama “our Lord and Savior” during a recent television appearance. “It’s like church over here,” Foxx told the audience. “First of all, give an honor to God and our Lord and Savior Barack Obama.” “Barack Obama,” he shouted as the audience cheered. Florida A&M professor Barbara Thompson published a book titled “The Gospel According to Apostle Barack.” The book likens Obama to Jesus Christ and Martin Luther King, Jr. “I learned that Jesus walked the earth to create a more civilized society, Martin (Luther King) walked the earth to create a more justified society, but, Apostle Barack, the name he was called in my dreams, would walk the earth to create a more equalized society, for the middle class and working poor,” she wrote in an excerpt published by The Daily Caller. “Apostle Barack, the next young leader with a new cause, had been taken to the mountaintop and allowed to see over the other side.” A controversial painting of President Obama, posed as Jesus Christ on the cross, was part of an art exhibit at Bunker Hill Community College in Boston. Photo by Art & Response The Michael D’Antuono painting is called “The Truth” — and features the president with his arms stretched out — wearing a crown of thorns. The original debut of the painting four years ago was cancelled due to public outrage, Design & Trend reported. At the time D’Antuono told Air America that he didn’t mean to “disrespect people’s religion. It’s meant as a political piece.” And at the Democratic National Convention street vendors were selling an array of products including a prayer garment embroidered with President Obama’s name — along with a calendar that declared him “heaven sent.” The entry also included a photograph of Obama along with a passage of Scripture from the New Testament. “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life,” the entry read — referencing John 3:16. The month of November includes an image of individuals with their hands on Obama’s back — with the words “The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.” Todd Starnes is the author of “Dispatches From Bitter America.” The book is endorsed by Sarah Palin, Mark Levin and Sean Hannity.

Some people believe that Obama was meant to be a great leader because of the meanings of his names. The article also mentions times when celebrities and others have compared Obama to Jesus or important religious figures. These items and statements do not have approval from the White House. They are just the opinions of some people who really admire President Obama."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Q: Sydney had a best friend in middle school, but now in high school Sydney never saw Taylor anymore and she didn't like it.  Given the context: How would you describe Sydney? A:","output":"In the given context, I would describe Sydney as sad and lonely without seeing Taylor. The transition from middle school to high school can be challenging, as relationships and social dynamics may change. In Sydney's case, she had a best friend in middle school, Taylor, with whom she likely shared many memories, moments, and experiences. However, since they are no longer spending time together in high school, Sydney might be finding it difficult to adjust to this new environment without the support and companionship of her best friend. Being without Taylor could lead to a sense of isolation and sadness for Sydney. It is natural for people to grow apart as their lives evolve, but that doesn't make it any easier to accept and process the emotional impact of such a change. Sydney's loneliness might be amplified in high school, where there may be more pressure to fit in and maintain friendships. It is important to remember that this description is not an indication that Sydney is not a good person or unworthy as a friend; it merely emphasizes the impact of losing her connection with Taylor. As she navigates the challenges of high school, Sydney might need to find new ways to create a sense of belonging and develop new friendships that ease her loneliness and bring happiness back into her life."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Generate a 2-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.npr.android.news.","output":"Title: Lacking Smooth Functionality - Needs Improvement (2/5) I recently downloaded the app \\"org.npr.android.news\\" to stay updated with the latest news and enjoy the engaging storytelling NPR is known for. Although it contains a wealth of information, I must admit I am quite disappointed with the overall experience of using this app, warranting a 2-star rating. Firstly, the user interface is far from intuitive. As a first time user, I expected the app to offer a walkthrough or at least a brief explanation of how to navigate around the different features and sections. However, I found myself feeling lost and confused in the maze of menus, resulting in a frustrating experience. Additionally, the app is cluttered with unnecessary elements, making it difficult to focus on the content. Another major issue with the \\"org.npr.android.news\\" app is its frequent crashes and stability issues. Numerous times, while browsing through the app or listening to a news story, the application would suddenly close without any warning. Restarting the app didn't always fix the issue, which led to a lot of wasted time and growing frustration. An app serving such time-sensitive content like the news should prioritize stability and performance. The search feature on this app leaves much to be desired. On multiple occasions, the search function would return completely irrelevant results, taking longer than necessary to find relevant content. A search bar should ideally be more efficient and point users in the right direction, but unfortunately, that is not the case with org.npr.android.news. Furthermore, I was disappointed to find that the app drains my smartphone battery at an alarming rate. This significantly limits the duration of usage, and makes it hard to rely on the app as a primary news source while on-the-go. On a positive note, I would like to mention that once the desired content is finally found, the quality of the news articles and audio reports is high, reflecting NPR's reputation for reliable journalism. However, with the current state of the app, those moments of relief are sadly overshadowed by the constant hurdles encountered along the way. In conclusion, while the \\"org.npr.android.news\\" app has potential, it is severely hindered by its poor user interface, stability issues, inefficient search function, and battery consumption. I genuinely hope that these concerns will be addressed in future updates, allowing NPR's journalism to shine through a well-designed and functional app. Until then, I am unfortunately unable to rate it higher than two stars."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him, with little success.During the First World War, Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant stationed in Cairo, notable for his insolence and knowledge. Over the objections of General Murray (Donald Wolfit), he is sent by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his revolt against the Turks.On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) for drinking from a well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle), who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment of Faisal's camp, and leave. Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal. His knowledge and outspokenness pique the Prince's interest.Brighton advises Faisal to retreat to Yenbo after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba which, if successful, would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. While strongly fortified against a naval assault, the town is lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Two teenage orphans, Daud (John Dimech) and Farraj (Michel Ray), attach themselves to Lawrence as his servants.They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. Gasim (I. S. Johar) succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. The rest make it to an oasis, but Lawrence turns back for the lost man. Sherif Ali, won over, burns Lawrence's British uniform and gives him Arab robes to wear.Lawrence persuades Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn), the leader of the powerful local Howeitat tribe, to turn against the Turks.

Given the question: Seven tips to good table manners Whether it's a dinner at a friend's house or a business meeting over lunch, we judge people based on their table manners. But what can you do if your kids do not behave themselves at the dinner tables? The following are seven tips to set your children on the road to good table manners: *Look for the good. Instead of pointing out all the things your children do wrong, point out what they do right. Please say, for example, \\"I am so proud of you. It was wonderful the way you served yourself.\\" *Don't turn dinner into an unpleasant \\"lecture time\\". That will turn kids off not only manners, but dinner, and you, too. *Check your own example. Don't show up for dinner in just your underwear   unless you want your kids to do the same. *Don't always consider your kids lazy and dirty ones. Instead, point out the behavior in a tender way. For example: \\" It' s a good idea to unfold your napkin, so if food falls you won't dirty your clothes.\\" *Teach your kids good manners in the form of a game. One night a week, try to have a formal dinner. Try dressing up, serve a special meal, and expect more formal manners. That will help improve their sense of manners. *Make kids understand part of the tradition. Invite guests over and let kids help serve them. This helps them indirectly learn about table manners. *Try dining out once in a while. Fast food restaurants aren't counted. Try a nice restaurant and let kids order their own food, pay the bill and give the tip. Which of the following should parents do to help their kids learn good table manners? A) Try dining out in fast food restaurants once in a while. B) Point out what's wrong with the kids' behavior at dinner. C) Keep telling the kids how to behave themselves at dinner. D) Improve kids' sense of manners by having a formal dinner at times.

Movie title: Ballot Box Bunny Context: Yosemite Sam is running for mayor of a small town, declaring such empty promises as: \\"There's enough fresh air and sunshine in this great country of ours for everybody â and I'll see to it, that you'll get your share!\\". Bugs Bunny is underneath the podium drinking carrot juice when Sam makes a pledge to make good on his previous promise \\"to rid this country of every last rabbit\\" if elected. Bugs then decides he needs to fight against Sam by running against him for mayor. Bugs proceeds to quickly try and win the townspeople over with Theodore Roosevelt's famous \\"I speak softly, but I carry a BIG stick!\\" quote, even dressing up like Roosevelt. However, Sam declares \\"I speak LOUD and I carry a BIGGER stick, and I use it too!\\" (When watching this on The Bugs Bunny Show, Daffy Duck says \\"I speak medium, and I carry the BIGGEST stick.) Sam has more than a few tricks up his sleeve. He steals Bugs' cigar stand, to which Bugs switches his \\"SMELLO\\" cigars with five-cent ATOM Explosive Cigars (\\"You Will Get A BANG Out of This\\"). He sends a boxful of \\"assorted\\" picnic ants to steal all of the food at Bugs' picnic, to which Bugs hides a dynamite stick in a watermelon for him. Then he rigs a cannon at the front door of Bugs' headquarters and greets Bugs with friendship at the back door, but the plan backfires on him when Bugs pretends that a pretty girl named Emma who loves Sam is at the front door. Then he challenges Bugs, asking him if he can \\"play the pi-anna\\", and Bugs takes the challenge, so he rigs explosives in the piano at a certain key and presents the piano to Bugs to play \\"Those Endearing Young Charms\\" (a gag recycled from a Private Snafu short), but Bugs misplays the tune on purpose to infuriate Sam, who plays it correctly and falls for his own trap. A quick chase through the streets leads the pair to the parade for the newly elected mayor.

Given the background: Some individuals have a specific mutation in the primary sequence of their hemoglobin molecules that causes them to aggregate, resulting in a deformation of their red blood cells. This abnormality is genetic in nature. A person may inherit the gene from one parent and have sickle cell trait (only some of the hemoglobin is hemoglobin S), which is usually not life-threatening. Inheriting the gene from both parents will result in sickle cell disease, which is a very serious condition.  and the situation: Dan studied two groups of individuals.

A:","output":"A: Group S, which had sickle cell anemia, had more members that had hemoglobin S. This is because sickle cell anemia is caused by mutations in the hemoglobin S gene, resulting in the formation of abnormal hemoglobin molecules that cause red blood cells to become misshapen (sickle-shaped). In contrast, group B had normal hemoglobin, meaning they did not possess the hemoglobin S mutation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie plot title: Major League Movie plot: Former Las Vegas showgirl Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitton) has inherited the Cleveland Indians baseball team from her deceased husband. Phelps has received a lucrative deal to move the team to Miami, and she aims to trigger the escape clause in the team's contract with Cleveland if season attendance falls below minimum levels. To do this, she replaces their existing players with aging veterans and inexperienced rookies, hoping a bad team will cause attendance to decline. Phelps hires Lou Brown, a former coach from the Toledo Mud Hens to manage the team. During spring training in Tucson, Brown and veteran catcher Jake Taylor discover the new team has a number of interpersonal issues as well as their own struggles with the game, such as the prima donna nature of Roger Dorn, the only player on a long-term contract with the Indians, and the weak arm of veteran pitcher Eddie Harris who is forced to doctor his pitches to stay competitive. The team starts the season on a losing streak. Their rookie pitcher, Ricky Vaughn, has an incredible fastball but with little control, leading him to be called \\"Wild Thing\\"; however, by chance, Brown discovers Vaughn has eyesight problems, and when they fit him with glasses, his pitching drastically improves, helping the Indians to a series of wins. The team rallies, bringing the Indians higher in the division standings. Phelps tries to demoralize the team by taking away their luxuries such as a private jet, but the team still holds strong, and appears to have a shot at winning the division. Meanwhile, Taylor finds that his ex-girlfriend Lynn is living in Cleveland, and tries to get her to come back to him even after learning she has become engaged to a new beau. When Phelps' original plan falls through, she decides that she will purposely void the contract, despite the financial penalty, and will move the team to Miami regardless. Donovan relays this to Brown, who informs the team that no matter how well they do, they will be fired after the season. The team succeeds in tying the...

The equation is: -5*y = 32*y - 259 First, we're going to move the \\"-5*y\\" from the left side to the right side of the equation. To do that we need to add \\"5*y\\" to both sides. This will help us have all the \\"y\\" parts on one side. So it looks like this: -5*y + 5*y = 32*y - 259 + 5*y Now, the left side will be just \\"0\\" because -5*y and +5*y cancel each other out: 0 = 37*y - 259 Now, we want to get rid of the \\"-259\\" on the right side. We do this by adding \\"259\\" to both sides. It looks like this: 0 + 259 = 37*y - 259 + 259 So now, we have: 259 = 37*y We're almost there! To find out the value of \\"y,\\" we just need to divide both sides by \\"37\\": 259 / 37 = 37*y / 37 This simplifies to: 7 = y So, y equals 7. There you have it!

He proclaimed himself sovereign of all Rus' and claimed patrimonial rights to the former lands of Kievan Rus'. Such ambitions led to the steady growth of Muscovite territory and power. The Mongol Yoke ended in 1480 with the defeat of Akhmat Khan of the Golden Horde in the Great stand on the Ugra river. Moscow extended its influence to the Principality of Ryazan in 1456, annexed the Novgorod Republic in 1477, and the Principality of Tver in 1483. Further expansionist goals of Ivan III clashed with the Lithuanian interests. Around 1486-87, territories along the ill-defined Lithuanian-Muscovite border in the upper reaches of the Oka River were under attack by Muscovy, allied with Meñli I Giray, khan of the Crimean Khanate. Tensions continued to rise. In August 1492, without declaring war, Ivan III began large military actions: he captured and burned Mtsensk, Lyubutsk, Serpeysk, and Meshchovsk; raided Mosalsk; and attacked territory of the Dukes of Vyazma. Orthodox nobles began switching sides to Moscow as it promised better protection from military raids and an end to religious discrimination by Catholic Lithuanians. Ivan III officially declared war in 1493, but the conflict soon ended. Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander Jagiellon sent a delegation to Moscow to negotiate a peace treaty. An \\"eternal\\" peace treaty was concluded on February 5, 1494.

What is the answer for the question: What was the name of the painting that portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea? from the following article ?  Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

Question: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Allowing it to be a part of life balance Answer:","output":"B. Not allowing time for recovery"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who was not formally trained but gifted? is inside the article: At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in..., can you guess it ?

Daughter: Blair's daughter, Stoni Ann Blair, is seen with her father Alexander Dorsey. Stoni would have been 15 now, if alive. Her sister claimed Blair killed Stoni by strangling her with a T-shirt and suffocated her with a plastic bag.

In a court filing, the state said the teen described a house of horror, where she and her surviving brother were beaten with an extension cord and piece of wood, hit with a hot curling iron and burned with a clothing iron. 'Blair tortured Stephen for approximately two weeks prior to his death by tying a belt around his neck, throwing hot water on him while in the shower and putting a plastic bag over his head,' the state said, quoting the 17-year-old.

Medical exams revealed evidence of abuse, including numerous scars, on the children. Toni Williams, 28, left, and Natasha Bell, 30, leave balloons at the house on Wednesday. The teenager said neither she nor her siblings have attended school for two years. Earlier Thursday, Blair appeared in court on child abuse charges via a video feed from a police lockup. Magistrate Renee McDuffee entered a not-guilty plea on her behalf. 'The charges in this matter are so heinous,' McDuffee said in explaining the 1 million bond. The state said it investigated allegations of abuse in 2002 and 2005. Blair was referred to counseling. The state said the two fathers of Blair's surviving children are unfit to care for them. Together they owe 50,000 in child support and haven't seen the kids in two to three years. Neighbors say Blair has lived in the complex at least 10 years.

In the second quarter, the Cardinals' year-long struggles continued as QB Tony Romo completed a 30-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.  The Cards would respond with a 28-yard field goal by kicker Neil Rackers.  Afterwards, Vanderjagt gave the Cowboys some breathing room with a 38-yard field goal as time ran out on the half.  In the third quarter, things continued to get worse for Arizona as Romo completed a 51-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, Dallas would wrap up the game with RB Marion Barber's 5-yard TD run.  The Cardinals would get a touchdown as QB Matt Leinart got a 3-yard TD run.  However, the Cards would drop their eighth-straight game.  With the loss, the Cardinals fell to 1-8.

Given the context: How would Casey feel as a result?  Possible answers: glad, terrible, horrible The answer to this question is:","output":"Casey would most likely feel glad as a result of Ash asking about their great past experiences. This is because reminiscing about positive and memorable moments often elicits feelings of happiness and nostalgia. By sharing these experiences, Casey and Ash are able to strengthen their bond and reaffirm the importance of their shared history. When someone shows interest in our past experiences, it communicates that they value the time spent together and genuinely care about our well-being. This can lead to an increase in self-esteem and feelings of validation. Additionally, discussing cherished memories can lead to an improvement in mood and a sense of belonging. However, there is a possibility that Casey may experience mixed emotions when discussing their past experiences. While they may feel glad overall, they might also encounter feelings of sadness or regret if these experiences have led to negative outcomes or they no longer share those same connections. These emotions could serve as a reminder of the passage of time and the inevitable changes that occur in relationships and life itself. In conclusion, the most likely emotional response for Casey in this context would be gladness, as they would be able to relive and celebrate their great past experiences with Ash.

After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it.

Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir ( or ; French pronunciation: [simon d@ bovwaR] ( listen); 9 January 1908 - 14 April 1986) was a French writer, intellectual, existentialist philosopher, political activist, feminist and social theorist. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both feminist existentialism and feminist theory. De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and monographs on philosophy, politics and social issues. She was known for her 1949 treatise The Second Sex, a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism; and for her novels, including She Came to Stay and The Mandarins. De Beauvoir was intellectually precocious, fuelled by her father's encouragement; he reportedly would boast, \\"Simone thinks like a man!\\" Because of her family's straitened circumstances, de Beauvoir could no longer rely on her dowry, and like other middle-class girls of her age, her marriage opportunities were put at risk. De Beauvoir took this opportunity to do what she always wanted to do while also taking steps to earn a living for herself.  After passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy in 1925, she studied mathematics at the Institut Catholique de Paris and literature/languages at the Institut Sainte-Marie. She then studied philosophy at the Sorbonne and after completing her degree in 1928, she wrote her diplome d'etudes superieures (roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) on Leibniz for Leon Brunschvicg (the topic was \\"Le concept chez Leibniz\\" [\\"The Concept in Leibniz\\"]). De Beauvoir was only the ninth woman to have received a degree from the Sorbonne at the time, due to the fact that French women had only recently been allowed to join higher education.  De Beauvoir first worked with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Claude Levi-Strauss, when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled, she sat in on courses at the Ecole Normale Superieure in preparation for the agregation in philosophy, a highly competitive postgraduate examination which serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for the agregation that she met Ecole Normale students Jean-Paul Sartre, Paul Nizan, and Rene Maheu (who gave her the lasting nickname \\"Castor\\", or beaver). The jury for the agregation narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of de Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam.  Writing of her youth in Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter she said: \\"...my father's individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mother's teaching. This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did she ever regret what she chose to study?","output":"Simone de Beauvoir did not express any regret in what she chose to study.

This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual.\\" This suggests that she embraced her intellectual pursuits and the choices she made in her studies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Japan. Some sports historians believe that the game of soccer began in England in the third century, however. They say that early English warriors  kicked around the head of a killed enemy. This may or may not be true, but it is certain that soccer is an ancient sport. Without doubt, the English played soccer during the times of King Edward I in the 1300s. In fact, the king passed a law against playing it. The law said, \\"There is great noise ... caused by kicking large balls from which many ghosts may appear.\\" Anyone caught playing soccer at that time was put into prison. Two hundred years later, Queen Elizabeth I still had people put into prison for playing this \\" _ \\" sport. Although there were such laws, soccer grew more popular. In 1681 it became an official  sport in England. By the 1800s, people throughout the country played soccer. By the 18th century, upper-class boys played it at schools. Its popularity grew among all English people. At a meeting held in an English school in 1843, the first rules were suggested. In 1863 the heads of English soccer teams met in London to agree on some official rules. They organized an English football association . By 1871 all of the English clubs were following these rules.

News article: California weighs college aid for illegal immigrants Nearly 20 years ago, California became the first state to crack down on immigration when voters approved a measure that cut off education, health and other benefits to illegal immigrants and their children. Now, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown is considering signing a bill that would grant financial aid to some illegal immigrants attending state colleges and universities. That would be in addition to laws that allow some illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition and let them accept privately funded college grants. As states such as Arizona, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina push hard stances against illegal immigrants, the turnaround in the Golden State is viewed as either a Democratic-controlled Legislature ignoring the will of Californians, or a path that other states will soon be following. Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, a Republican, is convinced that people in his state are opposed to the state's move toward acceptance of illegal immigrants. When Californians approved Proposition 187 — the voter referendum that cut benefits to illegal immigrants — in 1994, it passed with 59% of the vote. He's confident that voters still feel that way, so he's prepared to push for another voter referendum to overturn the college financial aid bill if Brown signs it into law. \\"Why is an illegal's dream more important than an American's dream?\\" asked Donnelly, who founded a Minuteman group to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border before being elected to office. \\"There's a tsunami of discontent with this bill. Outrage isn't even a strong enough word.\\" The bill, passed Sept. 2 by the Legislature, would give illegal immigrant students about 40million in financial aid and fee waivers. Anti-immigration groups says it makes even less sense when considering California's financial plight. \\"With a state that's billions of dollars in the red — our own version of Greece in the United States — the idea of giving additional taxpayer money to illegal immigrants is surreal,\\" said Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates lower levels of immigration. \\"It's hard to believe.\\" Some say the state's growing acceptance of illegal immigrants is a preview of what will happen as Hispanics — the fastest-growing demographic in the country — spread out to new states and establish families. \\"It appears that you get the most anti-immigration sentiment where immigrant populations are newer and where they are growing and when there's a climate where political leaders are drawing attention to this,\\" said John Skrentny, director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California-San Diego. A poll last year found that, for the first time, more Californians opposed a new version of Prop 187, according to a University of Southern California Dornsife College/Los Angeles Times poll. Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute of Politics at USC, said that's partly a result of more Hispanics entering the state and non-Hispanics leaving in recent decades. But he said the poll found that young, white voters were far more likely to oppose laws that bar illegal immigrants from receiving benefits because so many had grown up surrounded by Hispanics. \\"Because younger Californians are growing up in a multiethnic, multicultural society, they're much less likely to draw these types of distinctions than older voters,\\" Schnur said. That helps explain why states farther north and east are just recently starting their anti-immigration battles, Skrentny said. Georgia, which passed an anti-immigration law this year that was blocked by a federal judge, saw its Hispanic population nearly double from 2000 to 2010. South Carolina passed another anti-immigration law, which is being challenged in federal court, after its Hispanic population rose by 148% over the same time . And Indiana, which passed an anti-immigration law that has been halted by a federal judge, saw an additional 170,000 Hispanics pour into the state in the past decade. \\"These are folks that are not used to this kind of ethnic diversity,\\" Skrentny said. \\"That suggests that places like Alabama and Georgia are closer to where California was in the 1990s, and it suggests that California has moved on.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is about California possibly giving college financial aid to illegal immigrants. The governor of California, Jerry Brown, is considering signing a bill that would allow this to happen.

Witnesses tell the New York Post that during a performance at New York City's Neil Simon Theatre, a service dog broke free from its owner during the opening number and rushed the stage to go after the character Bombalurina, played by actress Mackenzie Warren.

Imagine the shock of theater-goers when, during the opening number, a seemingly peaceful performance almost went off-track as a service dog suddenly broke free from its owner and dashed towards the stage. The pup's target? Actress Mackenzie Warren, who was skillfully portraying the character, Bombalurina. Witnesses who reported to the New York Post stated that the service dog, seemingly spooked or enticed by the lavish production, slipped its owner's grasp and bounded on stage. It appeared to have only one goal in mind—to go after the feline character on display. Amidst the commotion that quickly followed, an usher from the theater bravely stepped in to quell the potentially chaotic situation. Demonstrating remarkable swiftness and composure, the usher managed to round up the courageous canine that had gone rogue in the name of audience safety. Once the dog had been secured, the usher returned it to a mortified owner who was, at that point, apologetic for the disruption caused by their four-legged friend. It is noteworthy that the Neil Simon Theatre generally operates under a \\"no animals\\" policy. However, specific exceptions are made for guide dogs and service animals that are called upon to provide assistance to patrons in need. As a representative for the musical relayed to the Post, in the long and storied history of Cats, this is the very first incident in which one of the \\"actual cats\\" was involved in an altercation with a dog. Assuaging any concerns that may have arisen, the representative confirmed that there were no injuries sustained by either the cast or the furry diva. Fortunately, it was not long until composure and calm were restored within the theater. The show, which typically maintains its reputation for delightful theatrical artistry, was able to continue shortly after the order was reestablished. Regardless of this extraordinary incident, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats undeniably remains an iconic production—cherished and enjoyed by both audiences and performers alike. While situations such as these are unlikely to recur often, the incident that unfolded in the Neil Simon Theatre serves to remind us all that, within the captivating sphere of live theater, one must always be prepared for the unexpected. In our increasingly fast-paced and digital-oriented world, this close encounter between Cats and a lone service dog on stage provides a timely reminder of the enduring appeal of live theater. Even after the curtains close, the stories that unfold both on and occasionally off the stage continue to captivate our collective imagination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — Analysts at the Homeland Security Department's intelligence arm found insufficient evidence that citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries included in President Donald Trump's travel ban pose a terror threat to the United States.      A draft document obtained by The Associated Press concludes that citizenship is an \\"unlikely indicator\\" of terrorism threats to the United States and that few people from the countries Trump listed in his travel ban have carried out attacks or been involved in terrorism-related activities in the U.S. since Syria's civil war started in 2011.      Trump cited terrorism concerns as the primary reason he signed the sweeping temporary travel ban in late January, which also halted the U.S. refugee program. A federal judge in Washington state blocked the government from carrying out the order earlier this month. Trump said Friday a new edict would be announced soon. The administration has been working on a new version that could withstand legal challenges.      Homeland Security spokeswoman Gillian Christensen on Friday did not dispute the report's authenticity, but said it was not a final comprehensive review of the government's intelligence.      \\"While DHS was asked to draft a comprehensive report on this issue, the document you're referencing was commentary from a single intelligence source versus an official, robust document with thorough interagency sourcing,\\" Christensen said. \\"The ... report does not include data from other intelligence community sources. It is incomplete.\\"      The Homeland Security report is based on unclassified information from Justice Department press releases on terrorism-related convictions and attackers killed in the act, State Department visa statistics, the 2016 Worldwide Threat Assessment from the U.S. intelligence community and the State Department Country Reports on Terrorism 2015.      The three-page report challenges Trump's core claims. It said that of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to carry out or try to carry out an attack in the United States, just over half were U.S. citizens born in the United States. The others were from 26 countries, led by Pakistan, Somalia, Bangladesh, Cuba, Ethiopia, Iraq and Uzbekistan. Of these, only Somalia and Iraq were among the seven nations included in the ban.      Of the other five nations, one person each from Iran, Sudan and Yemen was also involved in those terrorism cases, but none from Syria. It did not say if any were Libyan.      The report also found that terrorist organizations in Iran, Libya, Somalia and Sudan are regionally focused, while groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen do pose a threat to the U.S.      The seven countries were included in a law President Barack Obama signed in 2015 that updated visa requirements for foreigners who had traveled to those countries.      Christensen said the countries were also selected in part because they lacked the ability to properly vet their citizens and don't cooperate with U.S. efforts to screen people hoping to come to the U.S.      The report was prepared as part of an internal review Trump requested after his executive order was blocked by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It was drafted by staff of the Homeland Security Department's Intelligence and Analysis branch at the direction of its acting leader, David Glawe.      White House spokesman Michael Short said this was not the full report that Trump had requested. He said he believes \\"the intel community is combining resources to put together a comprehensive report using all available sources, not just open sources, and which is driven by data, not politics.\\"      The intelligence document was circulated beyond Homeland Security.      The draft document reflects the tensions between the president's political appointees and the civil servants tasked with carrying out Trump's ambitious and aggressive agenda. Trump has repeatedly complained about leaks meant to undercut his policies and suggested he does not trust holdovers from the Obama administration.      Trump originally said the ban was necessary to overhaul the vetting system for both refugees and would-be foreign visitors, saying that terrorists may try to exploit weaknesses to gain access to the United States. The order sparked chaos, outrage and widespread protests, with travelers detained at airports and panicked families searching for relatives.      But several courts quickly intervened and the 9th Circuit ultimately upheld a ruling blocking the ban and challenged the administration's claim that it was motivated by terrorism fears.      Trump's ban temporarily barred citizens from the seven countries from coming to the United States for three months. The order also temporarily shut down the U.S. refugee program for four months and indefinitely banned anyone from Syria.      A senior administration official told the AP on Sunday that a draft of the revised order will target those same seven countries. The official would not be named discussing the document before it is made public.      In a speech Friday to the Conservative Political Action Committee, Trump reiterated his claims on terrorism.      \\"We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country,\\" Trump said.      He said he singled out the seven countries because they had already been deemed a security concern by the Obama administration.      ___      Intelligence document available at http://apne.ws/2lSKNUo      ___      Contact Alicia A.

Some officials have critiqued administration policies, while the president and senior members of his staff have accused officials of leaking... ||||| Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has assigned the Department of Homeland Security, working with the Justice Department, to help build the legal case for its temporary travel ban on individuals from seven countries, a senior White House official tells CNN.      Other Trump administration sources tell CNN that this is an assignment that has caused concern among some administration intelligence officials, who see the White House charge as the politicization of intelligence -- the notion of a conclusion in search of evidence to support it after being blocked by the courts. Still others in the intelligence community disagree with the conclusion and are finding their work disparaged by their own department.      \\"DHS and DOJ are working on an intelligence report that will demonstrate that the security threat for these seven countries is substantial and that these seven countries have all been exporters of terrorism into the United States,\\" the senior White House official told CNN. \\"The situation has gotten more dangerous in recent years, and more broadly, the refugee program has been a major incubator for terrorism.\\"      The report was requested in light of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' conclusion that the Trump administration \\"has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.\\" The seven counties are Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.      The senior White House official said the desire to bolster the legal and public case that these seven countries pose a threat is a work in progress and as of now, it's not clear if DHS and DOJ will offer separate reports or a joint report.      One of the ways the White House hopes to make its case is by using a more expansive definition of terrorist activity than has been used by other government agencies in the past. The senior White House official said he expects the report about the threat from individuals the seven countries to include not just those terrorist attacks that have been carried out causing loss of innocent American life, but also those that have resulted in injuries, as well as investigations into and convictions for the crimes of a host of terrorism-related actions, including attempting to join or provide support for a terrorist organization.      The White House did not offer an on-the-record comment for this story despite numerous requests. The Department of Homeland Security, however, issued a statement Friday afternoon saying the seven countries were identified by the Obama administration as being of \\"great concern for terrorism.\\"      Dissension and concern      The White House expectation of what the report will show has some intelligence officials within the administration taking issue with this intelligence review, sources told CNN.      First, some intelligence officials disagree with the conclusion that immigration from these countries should be temporarily banned in the name of making the US safer. CNN has learned that the Department of Homeland Security's in-house intelligence agency, the I&A offered a report that is at odds with the Trump administration's view that blocking immigration from these seven countries strategically makes sense.      It's not clear if this was the conclusion of the I&A report but many DHS officials have said they do not think nationality is the best indicator of potential terrorist inclinations.      A Department of Homeland Security source who asked for anonymity since he was not authorized to speak on the record said the report from the I&A officials did not meet the standards of the agency since it relied upon open source material and did not utilize necessary data from the intelligence community, specifically the FBI.      Others in DHS disagree with that assessment of the I&A report and a senior official in the Department of Homeland Security told CNN that some DHS officials are concerned that the new I&A director -- Acting Undersecretary for Intelligence David Glawe -- may be politicizing intelligence. One source familiar with the department told CNN that Glawe came into I&A \\"like a bull in a china shop.\\"      A DHS official says the intention was to put together a comprehensive report with multiple sources and other agencies but the individuals in I&A did not do that to the standard that was required by their leadership, so Glawe said the report wasn't sufficient to go forward.\\"      DHS spokeswoman Gillian M. Christensen said the report was \\"commentary from open source reporting versus an official, robust document with thorough interagency sourcing. The (Office of Intelligence and Analysis) report does not include data from other intelligence community sources. It is clear on its face that it is an incomplete product that fails to find evidence of terrorism by simply refusing to look at all the available evidence.\\"      \\"Any suggestion by opponents of the President's policies that senior DHS intelligence officials would politicize this process or a report's final conclusions is absurd and not factually accurate. The dispute with this product was over sources and quality, not politics,\\" Christensen added.      The seven countries were originally designated by DHS in the Obama administration for tighter immigration scrutiny -- removing them from the visa waiver program -- but not for a temporary suspension of immigration, as the Trump administration has attempted.      A second issue for many in the intelligence community is the notion of the Trump White House seeking an intelligence report to fit the policy instead of the other way around, sources tell CNN.      A senior government official told CNN that the normal procedure would be for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to be tasked with creating such an intelligence report, working with all relevant agencies and providing dissenting views. Theoretically, this would be done before the policy was formulated.      The senior White House official told CNN that it's possible that the National Counterterrorism Center, via the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and perhaps the National Security Council might also provide reports on the same subject.      A senior government official told CNN that the National Counterterrorism Center, via the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, has already been tasked with such a report, separately from DHS and DOJ. This has prompted some in government to wonder whether the White House is shopping around among agencies for the report that best bolsters their policy and legal support for it.      Other intelligence officials told CNN that such discussions among agencies about differing interpretations of the existing intelligence are not unusual and do not necessarily reflect an effort to \\"shop around\\" for intelligence to support a particular policy.      White House to make its case      The White House is determined to prove that the Ninth Circuit argument is wrong, as are Democrats and those in the media, that terror attacks do not predominantly originate from the seven countries targeted by Trump's order.      Rep. Jerrold Nadler said on CNN late last month that \\"the various people who have, in fact, committed terrorist acts in this country, from 9/11 on, none of them came from any of the seven countries that are the subject of the President's executive order.\\"      The senior White House official told CNN that the Ninth Circuit's language that no one from those seven countries has \\"perpetrated a terrorist attack\\" or Nadler's comment that none had \\"committed terrorist acts\\" is false.      \\"It's using the most narrow definition of the term you can use,\\" the official said -- referring only to those who had successful killed an innocent civilian. That definition does not include those who wounded Americans, or those who plotted but failed in their attacks, or those who tried to join or provide material support to a terrorist group. Information will soon be presented to the public that makes this stronger case using the broader definition.      A case in point: Somali-born Abdul Razak Ali Artan attempted to run over and stab 13 innocent people at Ohio State University last November. He and his family left Somalia in 2007 and moved to Pakistan, arriving in the US in 2014. He was a legal permanent resident. His attack would not count using the more narrow definition.      \\"In most cases, the American people don't hear about these cases,\\" the senior White House official said, \\"but these cases have required thousands of man-hours by law enforcement in any number of plots to commit terrorism against this country. The threat is very jarring.\\"      The White House official said the Obama administration tried to downplay the threat while the Trump administration believes in a culture of \\"very robust disclosure.\\"      Asked about the report Thursday on \\"The Lead,\\" Rep. Dan Donovan, R-New York, emphasized that the intelligence community be nonpartisan.      \\"They should take data, take information, shouldn't interpret it in a political way and provide the President the information he needs to make decisions to protect our country,\\" he said.      Also commenting on the report was Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who acknowledged that he hadn't seen the specifics but \\"it looks wrong to me.\\"      \\"We ought to be doing the intel first, then set the policy and in large part based upon the intelligence,\\" Haass said. \\"If these reports are true, it's yet another example where this administration is having real trouble forging a functional relationship with the intelligence community.\\"      UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect new information from the Department of Homeland Security. ||||| WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump’s executive order to temporarily ban entry from seven Middle Eastern and African countries states that it is intended to “protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.”      However, few of the dozens of plots in the U.S. during and after 2001 were attempted or carried out by suspects who came from the countries targeted under the ban.

Plot title: Village of the Damned Movie plot: The quiet coastal town of Midwich, California is invaded by an unseen force which leaves ten women mysteriously pregnant. Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, except for one which is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal. As they grow older, the children are shown to have pale skin, platinum-white hair, fierce intellect and steely, cobalt eyes. The emotionless children display eerie psychic abilities and remarkable powers, which they use with deadly consequences, unleashing a reign of terror. When they actively use their mind-controlled powers, their irises or their entire eyes glow in different colours, mostly reddish-orange, but also green, yellow, violet, blue or pure white.There are some story differences from the earlier adaptation. In this version, the children \\"paired off\\", but one of the children, David (Thomas Dekker), loses his partner after she dies at birth. As a result, he shows human compassion while still resembling the other children and retaining some degree of psychic powers. This leads to him not fitting in well with the children. Their ruthless leader, Mara (Lindsey Haun) (\\"daughter\\" of a local doctor, Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve); her mother, Barbara (Karen Kahn), commits suicide by walking off an ocean cliff), considers him less important due to his expression of emotions. Because of his childhood loss, he understands what the other children do not: pain. He and his mother (Linda Kozlowski) (the local school principal) share a brief conversation about the meaning of the word \\"empathy\\", with David beginning to understand that if he feels pain, he can understand others' pain as well.

Answer:","output":"In the cinematic adaptation of \\"Village of the Damned,\\" Dr. Alan Chaffee is deeply troubled by the mysterious children's destructive powers and recognizes the need to stop their reign of terror. To do so, he devises a plan to detonate a briefcase of explosives in their stronghold, where the children convene and, to some extent, feel safe. Although it's not explicitly mentioned where Alan plans to detonate the explosives, one could surmise that he might choose a location central to the children's gathering, such as their school or the primary building where they live. This would enable him to target the dangerous children more effectively and minimize collateral damage to other townspeople. To ensure success, Alan might attempt to deceive the cunning children by projecting thoughts of a harmless subject. In the original 1960 film, the protagonist, George Sanders, utilized this tactic by concentrating intensely on a brick wall to distract the children from his true intentions. By employing such methods, Alan hopes to save the town, his troubled child David, and other innocents from the psychic malice of these unearthly beings.

In English, the word \\"biotiini\\" translates to \\"biotin.\\" Biotin, also known as vitamin H or vitamin B7, is a water-soluble vitamin that belongs to the B-complex family. Biotin plays a vital role in various metabolic processes in the human body, including the conversion of nutrients into energy, the synthesis of fatty acids, and the production of certain amino acids. It also contributes to the health of the skin, hair, and nails. Biotin deficiency, though rare, can lead to hair loss, skin rashes, and brittle nails. Natural sources of biotin include organ meats (such as liver and kidney), egg yolks, dairy products, fish, nuts, seeds, and some fruits and vegetables, including avocados and sweet potatoes. Biotin can also be synthesized by the bacteria present in the human gut, although the exact contribution of this source to the overall biotin intake is not well established. Biotin supplements are available in markets, and they are often used to improve the health and appearance of hair, skin, and nails. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any supplement to ensure that it is appropriate for your specific health needs and to determine the proper dosage.

Press release      Hitting rock bottom: Children's suffering in Syria at its worst - UNICEF      © UNICEF/UN027725/Al-Issa On 5 August 2016 in Aleppo city in the Syrian Arab Republic, displaced families from Reyadeh and 1070 neighbourhoods take shelter at the Teshreen Kindergarten in western Aleppo city.      Download multimedia assets from: http://weshare.unicef.org/Package/2AMZIFDMAU4      – Grave violations against children in Syria were the highest on record in 2016, said UNICEF in a grim assessment of the conflict’s impact on children, as the war reaches six years.      Verified instances of killing, maiming and recruitment of children increased sharply last year in a drastic escalation of violence across the country.      • At least 652 children were killed – a 20 per cent increase from 2015 – making 2016 the worst year for Syria’s children since the formal verification of child casualties began in 2014.      • 255 children were killed in or near a school.      • More than 850 children were recruited to fight in the conflict, more than double the number recruited in 2015. Children are being used and recruited to fight directly on the frontlines and are increasingly taking part in combat roles, including in extreme cases as executioners, suicide bombers or prison guards.      • There were at least 338 attacks against hospitals and medical personnel .            “The depth of suffering is unprecedented. Millions of children in Syria come under attack on a daily basis, their lives turned upside down,” said Geert Cappelaere, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa speaking from Homs, Syria. “Each and every child is scarred for life with horrific consequences on their health, well-being and future.”      Challenges in access in several parts of Syria stand in the way of assessing the full scale of children’s suffering and of urgently getting humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable girls and boys. Beyond the bombs, bullets and explosions, children are dying in silence often from diseases that can otherwise be easily prevented. Access to medical care, lifesaving supplies and other basic services remains difficult.      The most vulnerable among Syria’s children are the 2.8 million in hard-to-reach areas, including 280,000 children living under siege, almost completely cut off from humanitarian aid.      After six years of war, nearly 6 million children now depend on humanitarian assistance, a twelve-fold increase from 2012. Millions of children have been displaced, some up to seven times. Over 2.3 million children are now living as refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq.      Inside Syria and across its borders, coping mechanisms are eroding, and families are taking extreme measures just to survive, often pushing children into early marriage and child labour. In more than two thirds of households, children are working to support their families, some in extremely harsh conditions unfit even for adults.      Yet despite the horrors and suffering, there are many remarkable stories of children determined to pursue their hopes and aspirations. Darsy (12), now a refugee in Turkey said: “I want to be a surgeon to help the sick and injured people of Syria. I dream of a Syria without a war so we can go home. I dream of a world without any wars.”      “We continue to witness the courage of Syria’s children. Many have crossed frontlines just to sit for school exams. They insist on learning, including in underground schools. There is so much more we can and should do to turn the tide for Syria’s children,” said Cappelaere.      On behalf of the children of Syria, UNICEF is appealing to all parties to the conflict, those who have influence over them, the international community and anyone who cares about children for:      • An immediate political solution to end the conflict in Syria;      • An end to all grave violations against children including killing, maiming and recruitment, and attacks on schools and hospitals;      • The lifting of all sieges and unconditional and sustained access to all children in need, wherever they are in Syria;      • Providing refugee host governments and communities with sustainable support for vulnerable children, regardless of their status, and      • Continued financial support for UNICEF’s lifesaving assistance to Syrian children.      #      About UNICEF      UNICEF promotes the rights and wellbeing of every child, in everything we do. Together with our partners, we work in 190 countries and territories to translate that commitment into practical action, focusing special effort on reaching the most vulnerable and excluded children, to the benefit of all children, everywhere.

(Associated Press)      BEIRUT (AP) — In Syria, last year was the worst yet for the country's rising generation, with at least 652 children killed in 2016, the United Nations' child relief agency said Monday.      There was no letup to attacks on schools, hospitals, playgrounds, parks and homes as the Syrian government, its opponents and the allies of both sides showed callous disregard for the laws of war.      UNICEF said at least 255 children were killed in or near schools last year and 1.7 million youngsters are out of school. One of every three schools in Syria is unusable, some because armed groups occupy them. An additional 2.3 million Syrian children are refugees elsewhere in the Middle East.      The figures came in a UNICEF report released ahead of the sixth anniversary later this week of the 2011 popular uprising against President Bashar Assad's rule. The uprising, which was part of the Arab Spring movements across the Mideast, quickly escalated into full-blown civil war.      Children were among the first victims of the government's brutal crackdown.      On March 15, 2011, a small demonstration broke out in the capital of Damascus and three days later, residents in the southern Syrian city of Daraa marched to demand the release of teenage students arrested for writing anti-government slogans on their school's walls. They were tortured in detention.      The UNICEF report warns that for Syria's young generation, coping mechanisms and medical care are eroding quickly, driving children into child labor, early marriage and combat. Dozens of children are also dying from preventable diseases.      A report released a week ago by the international charity Save the Children said Syrian youngsters are showing signs of \\"toxic stress\\" that can lead to lifelong health problems, struggles with addiction and mental disorders lasting into adulthood.      The use of child soldiers is on the rise in Syria, UNICEF also said. At least 851 children were recruited by armed factions last year — more than twice compared to the year before.      Children across the country are at risk of severe injury while playing around land mines and cluster munitions. Demining operations in opposition-held areas have been severely hampered by inaccessibility to outside experts.      Meanwhile, the Norwegian Refugee Council said that as the sixth year of Syria's conflict nears its end, 13.5 million people remain in need of aid in dire and deteriorating conditions. Half as many are displaced in their own country, with almost 5 million refugees in neighboring countries where conditions keep getting increasingly desperate.      \\"Over the last year in Syria, all parties involved have blocked vital aid supplies and millions have become poorer, hungrier and more isolated from assistance and from the world,\\" said NRC's Mideast director, Carsten Hansen.      \\"We join the rest of the international humanitarian community on this milestone of shame to voice outrage at the plight of millions of civilians living in a downward spiral of despair,\\" the organization added.      It said parties to the conflict continue using siege and starvation as a weapon of war. Around 5 million people remain trapped in areas of active fighting, including almost one million in besieged areas who have no access to sustained humanitarian assistance.      ___      Associated Press Writer Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"In Syria, 2016 was the worst year so far for children, with at least 652 killed, according to the United Nations children's relief agency, UNICEF.

The New Zealand wicket-keeper hit 106 off 65 balls, including 14 fours and three sixes, as the visitors chased down their target of 161 in 17 overs. World Cup-winning England captain Heather Knight ably assisted at the other end, finishing 48 not out. Lauren Winfield's 58 had helped the hosts post a respectable 160-7 at York. The 27-year-old shared a 67-run second-wicket partnership with New Zealand all-rounder Sophie Devine (41) before the latter was bowled by Anya Shrubsole. Two late boundaries from South African Sune Luus looked to have led the Diamonds to a challenging total. However, Priest - who had managed just three runs in her first two Super League innings - scored a majestic and at times brutal hundred, ending the match with back-to-back boundaries. On a rain-affected day at the Ageas Bowl, Surrey Stars maintained their unbeaten start to the competition after edging to a four-run victory over holders Southern Vipers on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method. Hayley Matthews removed Surrey's England opener Tammy Beaumont for a duck, but South African pair Lizelle Lee (40) and Marizanne Kapp (42) took the visitors to 127-8 on a slow wicket. The Vipers' reply was hampered by a regular loss of wickets, as Stars captain Nat Sciver trapped Arran Brindle lbw, ran out Georgia Adams and bowled Charlotte Edwards for a duck, all in the space of 10 balls. New Zealand captain Suzie Bates, who scored the first Super League century in her previous innings, continued her fine form as she hit an unbeaten half-century. However, with the match finely poised and Vipers 100-7 - needing 28 off 22 balls - the rain began to fall in Southampton, which ultimately inflicted a first defeat of the competition on the home side. Australian all-rounder Ellyse Perry starred with bat and ball as Loughborough Lightning thumped Lancashire Thunder by 50 runs. Perry hit her first notable innings in the tournament, with her unbeaten 78 off 57 balls including 10 fours and a huge maximum, as Lightning scraped to a par total of 140-7 in Liverpool. Thunder's response began badly as Perry bowled Emma Lamb (2) and trapped England wicket-keeper Sarah Taylor (4) lbw to reduce the hosts to 14-2. Beth Langston (3-14) struck twice in an over - trapping both Natasha Miles and Sophie Ecclestone in front - as Thunder were bowled out for just 90.","output":"In a cricket game, the New Zealand wicket-keeper played very well, helping her team to win by scoring a lot of runs, while other teams also played exciting matches with different results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Previously, the Borgata was a joint venture between MGM Resorts International and Boyd Gaming, which is an American casino and hotel operating company. When the property first opened in 2003, it was at the time the largest hotel in Atlantic City, and MGM and Boyd each owned a 50% stake in the joint venture. However, in August 2010, MGM Resorts International announced that they would sell their stake in the Borgata and related properties due to licensing issues with the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. Although they were attempting to find a buyer for their shares, the sale never materialized. In September 2014, MGM cleared the concerns raised by the authorities, which led to their reinvestment rights being reinstated. As a result, MGM began to buy out Boyd Gaming's 50% interest in the Borgata. In 2016, MGM Resorts International acquired Boyd Gaming's stake, making MGM the sole owner of the casino and hotel. The deal was finalized on August 1, 2016, for a cash consideration of 900 million. Since becoming the sole owner, MGM Resorts International has undertaken a series of renovations and investment projects in the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa to maintain its image as a premier gaming and entertainment destination in Atlantic City. Furthermore, MGM Resorts International integrated the Borgata into their M life Rewards loyalty program, connecting the property with their extensive portfolio of hotels and resorts across the United States.

To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilard and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilard, to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research. A secret German facility, apparently the largest of the Third Reich, covering 75 acres in an underground complex, was being re-excavated in Austria in December 2014 and may have been planned for use in nuclear research and development. The letter is believed to be \\"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first. As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the \\"race\\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \\"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\\" to initiate the Manhattan Project. It became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II. For Einstein, \\"war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war.\\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \\"I made one great mistake in my life--when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification--the danger that the Germans would make them ...\\"  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"China\\" correctly answer the question \\"Which two powers during World War Two were likely racing to develop the first nuclear weapons?\\"?

Text messages have exploded in popularity, particularly among young people. The trade group for the wireless industry, CTIA, estimates more than 48 billion text messages are sent each month. The plan stems from the Warning Alert and Response Network Act, a 2006 federal law that requires upgrades to the emergency alert system. The act requires the Federal Communications Commission to develop ways to alert the public about emergencies. “The ability to deliver accurate and timely warnings and alerts through cellphones and other mobile services is an important next step in our efforts to help ensure that the American public has the information they need to take action to protect themselves and their families prior to, and during, disasters and other emergencies,” the commission chairman, Kevin J. Martin, said after the plan was approved. Carriers’ participation in the system, which has strong support from the industry, is voluntary. Cellphone customers would be able to opt out of the program. They also may not be charged for receiving alerts.

Specification of illumination requirements is the basic concept of deciding how much illumination is required for a given task. Clearly, much less light is required to illuminate a hallway compared to that needed for a word processing work station. Generally speaking, the energy expended is proportional to the design illumination level. For example, a lighting level of 400 lux might be chosen for a work environment involving meeting rooms and conferences, whereas a level of 80 lux could be selected for building hallways. If the hallway standard simply emulates the conference room needs, then much more energy will be consumed than is needed. Unfortunately, most of the lighting standards even today have been specified by industrial groups who manufacture and sell lighting, so that a historical commercial bias exists in designing most building lighting, especially for office and industrial settings.

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: What did the Supreme Court determine in Dred Scott v. Sandford? Suggested answer: Since passage of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , both rulings are superseded and no longer valid precedent. Should I validate this answer? Available options:  (a). No.  (b). Yes. A:","output":"(a). No. The answer suggested is incomplete and misleading as it jumps directly to the 14th Amendment and omits crucial information pertaining to the actual case. Dred Scott v. Sandford was a monumental case for the United States Supreme Court occurring in 1857, and its decision had significant implications on the state of slavery and citizenship in the country at that time. The case involved Dred Scott, an enslaved man who was taken by his owner from Missouri, a slave state, to Illinois, a free state, and later to a territory where slavery was forbidden by the Missouri Compromise. After returning to Missouri with his owner, Scott later sued for his freedom, arguing that his time spent in the free territory made him a free man. The Supreme Court, in a 7-to-2 decision, ruled against Dred Scott. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, had two main conclusions: 1. African Americans, whether they were enslaved or free, could not claim U.S. citizenship and were therefore unable to petition the courts for their freedom. 2. The Missouri Compromise was found to be unconstitutional, as the federal government couldn't prohibit slavery in certain territories because it would infringe upon the property rights of slave owners under the Fifth Amendment. These rulings intensified the national debate over slavery and contributed to the deepening divide between the North and South, which ultimately played a role in the subsequent Civil War. It is accurate that the passage of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1868 superseded and invalidated the Dred Scott decision, as it granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S., including formerly enslaved individuals. However, the answer should primarily focus on the core aspects of the Supreme Court's determination in the case before mentioning the 14th Amendment's impact on the ruling. A complete and appropriate answer would be: The Supreme Court determined in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) that African Americans, whether enslaved or free, were not considered U.S. citizens and therefore could not sue for their freedom in federal courts. Additionally, the Court ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional as it violated slave owners' property rights under the Fifth Amendment. This decision intensified the national debate over slavery and contributed to the growing divide between the North and South. The passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 ultimately invalidated the rulings from the Dred Scott case, granting citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States, including former slaves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What are the full names of the characters who learn that Serena cannot bear children?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In Depression-era North Carolina, George Pemberton is an ambitious timber baron who meets Serena Shaw, a young woman with a sad past. He falls in love with her, they marry, and Serena comes with George to his land. There, she starts taking control of things, pressuring and questioning George, while remaining affectionate towards him. George's business partner Buchanan feels threatened by her, as she begins to exceed his authority. Things grow worse between George and Buchanan, and Buchanan strikes a deal with the local sheriff, who wants to buy George's land to make a park. George is hurt by Buchanan's betrayal, and Serena convinces George that Buchanan was never his friend. The next day, they both go shooting alone from the group attempting to flush out a bear. After some snide remarks from Buchanan, George contemplates killing him only to hesitate and be seen by Buchanan. As Buchanan cocks his rifle, George fires first and shoots him in the chest. Campbell, George's worker, witnesses the murder, but denies it when Sheriff McDowell inquires. The death is ruled an accident. Serena consoles George and justifies his actions. One day, he sees his illegitimate son, Jacob, posing with his mother, Rachel, for a picture. He feels responsible for the boy, and since Rachel never asked for anything, he begins giving sums of money in envelopes to her for Jacob. Serena remains unaware of this, though she does consider Rachel and the baby a threat. One day, an accident occurs in the forest and Galloway, a mysterious worker, loses his hand to an axe swing. Serena rushes to help him and uses a belt as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding which saves his life. Having problems with her pregnancy, Serena and George rush to the hospital after Serena experiences heavy bleeding and pain. She miscarries. They learn that she can never again bear children. Things continue to grow worse, and Rachel's baby becomes more obvious to Serena. A:","output":"Based on the given context, the characters who learn that Serena cannot bear children are George Pemberton, Serena Shaw, and potentially other characters like Campbell (George's worker), Sheriff McDowell, and significant medical staff at the hospital. However, it is important to clarify that the text does not explicitly mention the people who learn about Serena's condition other than George Pemberton and Serena Shaw herself. Therefore, it certainly depends on who is around during the narrative or who they might choose to share this personal information with after they find out.  George Pemberton, the ambitious timber baron, is the husband of Serena. Even though he has an illegitimate son with Rachel, he deeply cares about Serena. When Serena experiences complications with her pregnancy, they rush to the hospital, where they learn about her inability to bear children.  Serena Shaw Pemberton is George's wife. Coming from a sad past, she quickly takes control of things in their relationship and business. However, when she experiences heavy bleeding and pain, they go to the hospital, where she learns that she can never again bear children. This information is especially impactful for Serena, considering her competitive nature and apparent worry over George's illegitimate son, Jacob, and his mother, Rachel. George's feelings of responsibility towards Jacob, reflected in his monetary gifts to Rachel, might further exacerbate Serena's anxieties and feelings of inadequacy due to her inability to bear children. The fact that Serena cannot bear children might be learned by Campbell, a worker of George, who seems to be in close circles with him. Campbell witnessed George's potential act of murder, signifying his proximity to the main events. Another person who could potentially learn about Serena's condition is Sheriff McDowell, who showed interest in George's land and was informal contact with Buchanan, George's former business partner. Medical staff at the hospital who took care of Serena when she was rushed due to heavy bleeding and pain would also know about her condition. It's important to note that these names are speculative beyond Serena Shaw and George Pemberton as the text does not provide explicit details on who else is informed about Serena's infertility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have an equation: -88 * i - 360 = 80. We want to find out what 'i' is. First, let's add 360 to both sides.  (-88 * i - 360) + 360 = 80 + 360 -88 * i = 440 (because 80 + 360 = 440) Now, we simply need to figure out what 'i' is. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -88.

His curiosity leads him to decipher the alien message, which inadvertently makes Earth visible to the extraterrestrial beings known as the Zeivrons. These mysterious aliens send a group of emissaries hidden from plain sight to Earth. Their mission is to observe humanity and evaluate the potential threat it poses to their civilization, as well as to ensure that their existence remains a secret. Through their advanced technology, they have the power to erase memories and even take control of human minds. As the Zeivrons conduct their research, they stumble upon Larry Storch, the very man who deciphered their signals. The aliens quickly realize that he is the only person capable of understanding their technology and potentially revealing their presence on Earth. They decide to eliminate him to protect their mission and existence. However, Larry has been working tirelessly in decoding further messages from the Zeivrons and was able to gather some information about them. Sensing the potential danger he is in, he confides in his best friend Dr. Maria Watson, a talented cryptologist. Together, they race against time to uncover the Zeivrons' intentions and find a way to reveal their infiltration to the world. As they dig deeper into the alien's secret, they are pursued by alien assassins who will stop at nothing to fulfill their duty. Agent Jack Harper, a skillful and cunning detective, gets entangled in the hunters' path when he stumbles upon the unusual case of Larry Storch.

However, when he starts investigating the trail of bizarre incidents connected to Larry, he becomes an essential ally to Larry and Maria. The trio must work together to expose the alien invaders, ultimately leading to a nail-biting confrontation. As they make their last stand against the stealthy assassins, Larry sacrifices himself to give Maria and Jack the chance they need to reveal the alien threat to the world.

I'm here to help you understand these two questions. Question 1: How do I know if I am a lesbian trapped in a man's body or just an effeminate male? This question is about figuring out your identity.

Next question: who owns the rights to destroy all humans?","output":"The rights to the video game \\"Destroy All Humans!\\" are owned by THQ Nordic, a video game publisher based in Austria. THQ Nordic GmbH, had acquired said rights after a series of acquisitions and mergers. To give you a more in-depth perspective, I'd like to further explore how THQ Nordic came into the possession of these rights. \\"Destroy All Humans!\\" was originally developed by Pandemic Studios and was first published by THQ (Toy Headquarters) in 2005. This was a single-player action-adventure game where the player controls Cryptosporidium 137 – a member of an alien species – who has come to Earth to harvest DNA from humans to continue cloning his species. THQ faced financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy in December 2012. During the bankruptcy proceedings, instead of selling the company as a whole, its assets including the franchises, studios, and publishing contracts were sold separately.     A lot of well-known games fell into new hands during this process and \\"Destroy All Humans!\\" was among these. Specifically, it was acquired by Nordic Games (now THQ Nordic) in 2013 during one of these auctions. Later, THQ Nordic rebranded itself, adopting the name of THQ to reflect and leverage the legacy of the brand. As of now, under THQ Nordic, the franchise has seen a revival with the release of the remake \\"Destroy All Humans!\\" in 2020, maintaining the ownership of the rights. It's important to note that the ownership of the rights to a game title includes the right to its intellectual property, images, storyline, characters, and more. These rights give THQ Nordic the exclusive ability to develop new games under the \\"Destroy All Humans!\\" title, create merchandise, authorize the production of related media like adaptations, and more.  In summary, THQ Nordic, an Austrian game publisher, owns the rights to the \\"Destroy All Humans!\\" franchise through a path of various acquisitions and mergers. They can continue to use this title to make new games, merchandises, or adaptations, preserving the legacy of this much loved alien-themed game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: When you're a parent to a young child, you spend a lot of time talking about feelings: about having to share, about being disappointed because you may not have a cookie instead of broccoli  , about the great injustice of a parent pressing the elevator button before the child has a chance to. And in a parenting culture that's increasingly concerned with centering children's needs above all else, mothers and fathers have become skillful at talking about their kids' feelings while masking their own. But new research suggests that parents who hide their negative emotions are doing their children, and themselves harm. A study published this month says that when parents put on a faux-happy   face for their kids, they do damage to their own sense of wellbeing and authenticity. \\"For the average parent the findings suggest when they attempt to hide their negative emotion expression and overexpress their positive emotions with their children, it actually comes at a cost: doing so may lead parents to feel worse themselves,\\" researcher Dr Emily Impett, says. It makes sense that parents often fall back on amping up   the positivity for the sake of their children--there are a lot of things in the world we want to protect our kids from. But children are often smarter than we expect and are quite in tune with what the people closest to them--their parents--are feeling. There was a time about a year or so ago, for example, when I received some bad news over the phone; I was home with my four-year-old and so I did my best to put on a brave face. She knew immediately something was wrong though, and was confused. When I finally let a few tears out and explained that Mom heard something sad about a friend, she was, of course, just fine. My daughter patted my shoulder, gave me a hug, and went back to playing. She felt better that she was able to help me, and the moment made a lot more sense to her emotionally than a smiling mom holding back sobs. I was glad that I could feel sad momentarily and not have to work hard to hide...

Write a title for this article: WASHINGTON (Reuters)  The number of new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week and regional manufacturing activity slipped in January, hinting at some slowing in the economic recovery. The Labor Department said on Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 36,000 last week, to 482,000, as a backlog of applications from the holidays was processed. It was the third consecutive week that claims rose. Analysts had expected new claims to slip to 440,000. Separate data showed that factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowed in January to a three-month low, while a gauge of economic prospects set a record high last month. “The recovery of the U.S. economy continues, but it’s at a slower pace than we have seen at the end of 2009. The biggest problem is companies remain reluctant to expand their capacities, which is weighing on the labor market,” said Harm Bandholz, an economist at Unicredit Research in New York. Analysts say they believe the economy grew at an annual rate of 4 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the 2.2 percent rate in the July-September period. The Labor Department said the jump in initial claims for jobless aid last week was administrative and not economic. At least one analyst, however, interpreted the data differently. “That implies claims in previous weeks were understated, so the reduction in new jobless claims between December and January is not as extreme as had been thought,” said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. “But with layoffs diminishing, the labor market is still gradually healing.” Analysts were not too troubled by the drop in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank’s business activity index, which fell to 15.2 this month as orders declined. The index, which measures factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region, hit a four-and-a-half-year high of 22.5 in December. Markets had expected the index for January to come in at 18. A reading above zero indicates growth in the region’s manufacturing sector. The survey’s employment index rose to its highest level since February 2008. “The data still point to growth in activity this month, and we don’t see any need to significantly alter our view that the factory sector is shifting from being on the mend to steady expansion,” said Omair Sharif, an economist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Conn. Bolstering views that the recovery remains intact, the Conference Board, a business research group, said its index of leading economic indicators rose 1.1 percent last month, to a record high of 106.4. Although the Labor Department report also showed that the four-week moving average of new jobless claims, a measure of underlying trends, ended 19 weeks of declines last week, it remained below the 450,000 level analysts consider to indicate stability in the labor market. The number of workers still collecting benefits after an initial week of aid fell to the lowest since January 2009. The drop probably reflected people exhausting their unemployment benefits rather than a pickup in hiring. There were 5.9 million people receiving extended benefits under special programs at the beginning of January.

Multi-choice problem: Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? Phineas knows a girl who is jealous of Maxime.  1). unacceptable 2). acceptable","output":"The next sentence, \\"Phineas knows a girl who is jealous of Maxime,\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. To analyze the sentence further, let us break it down into its individual components: 1. Syntactic acceptability: Syntactic acceptability refers to the structure and arrangement of words in a sentence according to the rules of grammar. In this case, the sentence follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern, which is a common sentence structure in the English language. The sentence has a clear subject \\"Phineas\\", a main verb \\"knows\\", and an object \\"girl.\\" In addition, the relative clause \\"who is jealous of Maxime\\" provides additional information about the object. The relative clause also follows the SVO structure with \\"who\\" as the subject, \\"is\\" as the verb, and \\"jealous\\" as the object complement followed by a prepositional phrase \\"of Maxime.\\" Thus, the sentence structure follows the rules of English grammar, making it syntactically acceptable. 2. Semantic acceptability: Semantic acceptability refers to the meaning and coherence of a sentence. In this case, the sentence conveys a logical and understandable message – that Phineas is aware of a girl who seems to be envious or resentful of someone named Maxime for some reason. The words in the sentence are used correctly, and their combination conveys a meaningful and coherent idea. Consequently, the sentence is semantically acceptable. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Phineas knows a girl who is jealous of Maxime\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Therefore, the correct answer to the multi-choice problem is option 2). acceptable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

Write a title for this article: Corey Lee, an immigration lawyer in Manhattan, said: “If you didn’t go to a class for a year, you should expect something is going on.” Ms. Sun, 29, earned a master’s degree in art therapy at a Massachusetts college and moved to New York to work for a nonprofit social services agency. (She declined to name the college or the organization because she did not want to endanger her application for a waiver to return to the United States.) Her employer applied for an H-1B visa for her, but she faced a gap of several months before it would come through. Ms. Sun said her broker told her she could work instead of taking classes, but referred her to the university. In February 2015, after she enrolled, Ms. Sun said she called there approximately 20 times; no one responded. “If one person called me back and told me it was fake, I would not have gone to the University of Northern New Jersey,” Ms. Sun said. “What else can I do? I don’t know the American system.” Louis Farrell, the director of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, part of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said academic nonimmigrant student visas require the holder “to enroll in a full course of study and attend and pass all their classes” and that “they should be wary of any recruiter who promises they can work without restrictions while attending school.” But there seem to be inconsistencies in the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services’ definition of a “full course of study.” In one entry on its website, it says that the designated school officer can determine a full course of study. Farther down, it says that a student must complete at least 18 hours of classroom study. Ultimately, the students said that because the Department of Homeland Security’s website certified the University of Northern New Jersey, they believed the institution was legitimate. In addition, the website of the New Jersey Education Department listed it as approved. So did the website of the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges, a national body. Its director, Michale S. McComis, later said he had certified the university in order to cooperate with the government’s investigation. Z., who is 27 and also from China, did not win the H-1B lottery. He found the University of Northern New Jersey online without a broker. “How risky will it be for obtaining full-time C.P.T. without attending any classes?” he wrote to the university in an email he showed to The New York Times, referring to Curricular Practical Training. The response, from the generic info@unnj.edu: “If you are not comfortable with what we have offered, I ask you to try another university in the New Jersey area.” Without a direct answer, Z. said he fell back on the university’s government accreditation. A year passed. When he asked how he would provide evidence for another H-1B application, the university suggested making up classes from a template, and to send it in with 620. That was the final flag. Unlike students who were listed as co-conspirators, Z. did not fabricate school transcripts. Instead, he transferred. But on April 5, his student status was terminated because he had been enrolled at the fake university for more than 45 days. K., a 30-year-old from China who earned an M.B.A. in New England, began to suspect something about the university after he had worked for a year and did not hear about the start of classes. “I was wondering if there was a lecture or something I could attend,” he said. His broker told him online classes were coming soon. K. said that he, too, relied on the university’s accreditations. “If the government is not trustworthy, who should we trust?” he said. His girlfriend, S., 26, whom he met at business school, was accepted to the university the next year, in January 2016. But she said the broker told her that her authorization form and the school schedule would be delayed while the university expanded to two more campuses. The couple went to the campus in Cranford in March, only to find the doors locked, supposedly because it was spring break. Then at 8:20 a.m. on April 5, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents knocked on the door of their rural New England home. K. and S. were detained in separate cells for several hours. The next day, K. resigned from his job at a local company. They are both waiting for hearing dates. Like the other students, they were notified that they needed to leave the country or apply for reinstatement of their student visas. But students have said that few colleges, if any, have been willing to sponsor them after they were tainted by the University of Northern New Jersey. Reinstatement ultimately depends on the government’s approval. The students say they have been put in an untenable position financially. They paid thousands of dollars either to brokers or directly to the university. Eight students alone said they spent a combined 46,000. Some paid the university via PayPal or cash, with the money going to a holding company listed on some students’ invoices: Waterfall Properties. As they wait for a hearing in immigration court that could take a year or longer, they cannot legally work. “Typically in any fraud investigation, it is our policy that we do not refund any money,” Mr. Phillips, the Homeland Security spokesman, said. “Absolutely there was a message,” Mr. Phillips added. “We welcome international students in America, but they must do so according to the standards, the right way.” But Barmak Nassirian, the director of federal relations and policy analysis for the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, wondered why government officials bothered to create a fake university when such places already existed. Several fraudulent universities have been shut down in previous years. The brokers may have recognized the University of Northern New Jersey as a visa mill, Mr. Nassirian said, but he could see how some students could be deceived by its certifications. “Can you really blame a student,” he said, “even if they are a little greedy, a little gullible, or a little too hopeful?” Title:","output":"Unwitting Students Caught in the Web of a Fake University and Immigration Crackdown"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Choices: *benthic; *autotrophic; *heptic; *trophic; A:","output":"Different feeding \\"positions\\" in a food chain or web are associated with trophic levels.  Trophic levels are the positions that an organism occupies in a food chain, and they help to understand the flow of energy and the transfer of nutrients among the organisms in an ecosystem. The main trophic levels include: 1. Primary producers (autotrophs): These are organisms that produce their own food, primarily through the process of photosynthesis. They convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into energy in the form of glucose, which they utilize to create their own biomass. Examples include plants, algae, and some bacteria. 2. Primary consumers (herbivores): These organisms feed directly on primary producers. They consume the energy stored in the producers' biomass and convert it into their own biomass through the process of consumption. Examples of primary consumers include insects, grazing mammals like deer, and herbivorous fish. 3. Secondary consumers (carnivores): These organisms feed on primary consumers. They gain energy by consuming the biomass of herbivores and transferring it to their own bodies. Examples of secondary consumers include small predators like birds, reptiles, and some fish species. 4. Tertiary consumers (top predators): These organisms feed on secondary consumers, often referred to as apex predators. They occupy the highest position in the food chain and have few, if any, natural predators. Examples include lions, wolves, and sharks. Decomposers and detritivores also play a significant role in food webs by breaking down dead organic matter and recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. They are not part of the trophic levels, but they are essential in maintaining the ecosystem's balance. In summary, the answer to your question is trophic levels. These levels help categorize the different feeding positions organisms occupy in food chains or webs, ultimately providing insight into energy transfer and nutrient cycling within ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

CNN projects that North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis has won the state's GOP Senate primary. Tillis, who was backed by many mainstream Republicans, topped 40% of the primary vote Tuesday, avoiding a runoff in July.  Tillis beat a bunch of more conservative candidates for the chance to face off this November against first-term Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, who is considered very vulnerable in the general election.

The exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16. Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side, totaling 100 square miles (259 km2).Two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory: the port of Georgetown, Maryland, founded in 1751, and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749. During 1791–92, Andrew Ellicott and several assistants, including a free African American astronomer named Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point. Many of the stones are still standing.A new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The federal district was named Columbia (a feminine form of \\"Columbus\\"), which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time. Congress held its first session in Washington on November 17, 1800.Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 that officially organized the District and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. Further, the unincorporated area within the District was organized into two counties: the County of Washington to the east of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west.

(CNN)  -- The company that produced the peanut butter linked to a nationwide salmonella outbreak said late Tuesday that it was voluntarily recalling all products made in its Blakely, Georgia, plant. Salmonella bacteria are transmitted to humans by eating contaminated foods. The Peanut Corporation of America, a peanut processing company, made the peanut butter sold by King Nut company. Health officials in Minnesota have said that salmonella they linked to an open container of King Nut peanut butter was the same strain of bacteria responsible for the apparently ongoing outbreak, which has infected at least 434 people in 43 states. However, the King Nut product is unlikely to be responsible for the entire outbreak, since it distributes its peanut butter only to food service companies in just seven states: Ohio, Minnesota, Michigan, North Dakota, Arizona, Idaho and New Hampshire. So, the Peanut Corporation of America said it was voluntarily recalling all peanut butter produced in its Blakely plant \\"out of an abundance of caution.\\" Some of it is distributed to another company.  What you need to know about food poisoning ». \\"We deeply regret that this has happened,\\" company president Stewart Parnell said. Over the past few days, Food and Drug Administration inspectors visited the Blakely plant, where they took hundreds of samples for testing, Parnell said. The salmonella outbreak has been spreading across much of the country since September. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium played a role in the deaths of an elderly person from southwestern Virginia and an adult from northern Virginia. The third death was a nursing home resident in her 70s in Minnesota. All three of the patients who died had underlying illnesses that could have contributed to their deaths, state officials said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a written statement, has called peanut butter \\"a likely source\\" of the infections. But it said that no association had been found with common brand names of peanut butter sold in grocery stores. The first cases of salmonella were reported September 3, but most occurred between October 1 and January 6, the CDC said. About 18 percent of cases were hospitalized as a result of their illness, and patients have ranged from 2 months to 98 years of age. CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said a preliminary analysis suggests peanut butter as a likely source of the outbreak. No cases connected to the outbreak have been reported in Montana, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Florida or Alaska. Very young people, older people and those with compromised immune systems are most vulnerable to severe side effects of salmonella infection, including death, health officials have said. CNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A company that made peanut butter had a problem because some of it had bad germs called salmonella. These germs can make people sick if they eat contaminated food. The company decided to take back all the peanut butter they made at their factory in Georgia to make sure people stay safe. Some people got sick from these germs, and very old or very young people can get more sick than others.

Now, let's talk about why the other options are wrong: - Atlanta, Atlanta Falcons, Falcons, Georgia Dome, Lambeau Field South, Seahawks, Seattle Seahawks, Super Bowl, Super Bowl XXXIII, National Football League, and NFL are wrong because they are all talking about teams, locations, or leagues, not a specific player in a situation. - CNN is wrong because it's a news network and has nothing to do with the player's performance. - Danny White is incorrect because he is the one who found the receiver, not the receiver himself. - Eugene Robinson and Michael Vick are wrong because they weren't mentioned in the passage at all.

Mohammad Amir, the convicted spot-fixer, has been cleared for an early return to domestic cricket in Pakistan by the International Cricket Council. Amir, 22, was jailed and banned from the sport for five years for his part in a spot-fixing scandal during his country's 2010 tour of England. The prodigiously talented seam bowler, who delivered pre-arranged no-balls at Lord's as part of a plot involving Mohammad Asif and Pakistan captain Salman Butt, was not due to play again until September 2. Mohammad Amir has been cleared by the ICC to make an early return to Pakistan domestic cricket. Amir was involved in the spot-fixing scandal during Pakistan's tour of England in 2010. But after a meeting of the ICC Board in Dubai, it has been announced that the governing body, the PCB, and anti-corruption chief Sir Ronnie Flanagan had approved his domestic availability with immediate effect. An ICC statement read: 'The ACSU chairman, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, with the prior approval of the ICC Board and the Pakistan Cricket Board, has exercised his discretion to allow Mohammad Amir to return to domestic cricket played under the auspices of the Pakistan Cricket Board with immediate effect. 'Amir's five-year ban is scheduled to expire on 2 September 2015. The ACSU chairman had exercised the powers vested in him under Article 6.8 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code after he was satisfied that Amir had cooperated with the ACSU by fully disclosing his part in the matters that led to his disqualification, admitting his guilt, showing remorse and cooperating with the unit's ongoing investigations and by recording messages for the ACSU education sessions.' In the aftermath of the spot-fixing scandal, Amir distinguished himself from his co-conspirators by admitting his guilt and showing remorse. Asif and Butt repeatedly fought charges before being found guilty at Southwark Crown Court. The latter pair were also jailed, with Asif banned from cricket for seven years (two suspended) and Butt 10 years (five suspended). TV footage showing Amir bowling a no-ball during a Test match at Lord's in 2010. With Pakistan's first-class season already at an end and the limited-overs President's Cup finishing early next month, Amir may have to wait some time for his first competitive cricket. But the end of his ban allows him to make a full return to training and net practice, possibly overseen by the PCB, and even club cricket should the opportunity arise. It also increases his prospects of an international recall against England, of all teams. They take on Pakistan in a three-format tour of the United Arab Emirates in October, leaving Amir plenty of time to prove himself ready for selection. Quite how that would go down with the likes of Alastair Cook, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Eoin Morgan and Steven Finn - current England players who were on duty in that fateful Lord's Test - remains to be seen. There is also a question mark over Amir's status within the Pakistan dressing room. While the PCB have lobbied hard for his early return and clearly expect him to make a full comeback at the highest level, players who have performed cleanly in the shadow of his indiscretions and those of others, may be less inclined to share the field with Amir. The issue is unlikely to disappear quietly. Should Amir locate anything close to the form that made him the youngest bowler to take 50 Test wickets, he will be back centre stage soon enough and with the possibility of at least a decade of international cricket in front of him. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Mohammad Amir, a talented Pakistani cricket player involved in a spot-fixing scandal during the 2010 tour of England, has been cleared for an early return to domestic cricket in Pakistan by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Originally banned from the sport for five years and jailed, Amir is now allowed to play domestic cricket with immediate effect after a meeting of the ICC Board in Dubai.

The film opens with the narrator (who is also the film's director) driving out West along a desert highway, relating to the audience his previous experiences as a streetside bookseller in New York City. The entire documentary – including the central events involving his experiences among the street booksellers in New York – is thus \\"told\\" as a long conversation. The narrator describes his post-graduation years in New York, and how he ended up at one point virtually penniless. Driven by a desperate need to pay the rent, he resorts to wheeling his own books out to the street to try to sell them. He reveals that he was not only successful in making a significant amount of cash on that first day, but he has also met a variety of interesting and strange characters of the streets of New York – including other street booksellers. A motley assortment of street booksellers on West 4th street, in Greenwich Village, New York City, are first introduced. Among them: \\"Slick\\" Rick Sherman, a semi-professional magician; Al Mappo, so named because he only sells maps and atlases; Emil, who says only he \\"escaped\\", though we do not know from where; and Pete Whitney: King of the booksellers, toad collector, and collage artist.

For example, if you're dressing your Barbie as a doctor, the outfit probably came with a stethoscope and lab coat. If your Barbie is in her swimsuit, she'll need a towel and beach ball. Don't be afraid to mix and match accessories. Your Barbie can have as many interests and occupations as you want, and her outfit should reflect that. If you want the Barbie to look casual, put a floppy sun hat, slouchy hat, or beanie on her head. You can also pull the doll's hair back with clips. For more formal looks, dress her in hats with veils, flowers, or jewels. You can knit or crochet your own Barbie hat. Check fabric stores or online sewing sites for patterns. For example, knit a Barbie beret in your favorite color. Put reading glasses on Barbie or sunglasses, if she's going to be out in the sun. You can also include jewelry like beaded necklaces or dangling earrings to make your Barbie look glamorous. You can also style your doll with crowns, headbands, and bracelets. Try on a variety of shoes to see which style matches the outfit you've chosen. Choose from sandals, high heels, boots, ballet shoes, or sneakers. You'll need to push the Barbie's feet firmly into the shoes so they don't fall off. To make it easy to find pairs of shoes, store the shoes in a divided container that you can snap shut. For example, keep them in a jewelry case that has divided tabs. Many formal dresses for Barbie come with matching handbags or clutches. If you want your Barbie to look more formal or polished, have her hold a bag. For more casual looks, have the doll hold a backpack or slouchy bag. Some office or business Barbies may come with a briefcase or messenger bag. Summary:","output":"When you dress your Barbie, you can use different clothes and accessories to show what she likes to do, like being a doctor or going to the beach.

Background: Wladyslaw Gomulka (Polish: [vwa'diswaf go'muwka]; 6 February 1905 - 1 September 1982) was a Polish communist politician. He was the de facto leader of post-war Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomulka was initially very popular for his reforms; his seeking a \\"Polish way to socialism\\"; and giving rise to the period known as \\"Gomulka's thaw\\". Context: In the fall of 1943, the PPR leadership began discussing the creation of a Polish quasi-parliamentary, communist-led body, to be named the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa, KRN). After the Battle of Kursk the expectation was of a Soviet victory and liberation of Poland and the PPR wanted to be ready to assume power. Gomulka came up with the idea of a national council and imposed his point of view on the rest of the leadership. The PPR intended to obtain consent from the Cominterm leader and their Soviet contact Georgi Dimitrov. However, in November the Gestapo arrested Finder and Malgorzata Fornalska, who possessed the secret codes for communication with Moscow and the Soviet response remained unknown. In the absence of Finder, on 23 November Gomulka was elected general secretary (chief) of the PPR and Bierut joined the three-person inner leadership.  The founding meeting of the State National Council took place in the late evening of 31 December 1943. The new body's chairman Bierut was becoming Gomulka's main rival. In mid-January 1944 Dimitrov was finally informed of the KRN's existence, which surprised both him and the Polish communist leaders in Moscow, increasingly led by Jakub Berman, who had other, competing ideas concerning the establishment of a Polish communist ruling party and government.  Gomulka felt that the Polish communists in occupied Poland had a better understanding of Polish realities than their brethren in Moscow and that the State National Council should determine the shape of the future executive government of Poland. Nevertheless, to gain a Soviet approval and to clear any misunderstandings a KRN delegation left Warsaw in mid-March heading for Moscow, where it arrived two months later. By that time Stalin concluded that the existence of the KRN was a positive development and the Poles arriving from Warsaw were received and greeted by him and other Soviet dignitaries. The Union of Polish Patriots and the Central Bureau of Polish Communists in Moscow were now under pressure to recognize the primacy of the PPR, the KRN and Wladyslaw Gomulka, which they ultimately did only in mid-July.  On 20 July, the Soviet forces under Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky forced their way across the Bug River and on that same day the combined meeting of Polish communists from the Moscow and Warsaw factions finalized the arrangements regarding the establishment (on 21 July) of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), a temporary government headed by Edward Osobka-Morawski, a socialist allied with the communists. Gomulka and other PPR leaders left Warsaw and headed for the Soviet-controlled territory, arriving in Lublin on 1 August, the day the Warsaw Uprising erupted in the Polish capital. Question: What is the Polish Committee of National Liberation?. Whats the answer?","output":"The Polish Committee of National Liberation (also called PKWN) was a temporary government created by Polish communists during World War II, when Poland was being liberated from German occupation. It was formed to help organize and manage the country as it was being freed from the Nazis. The PKWN was led by Edward Osobka-Morawski, a socialist who worked together with the communists. This group played an important role in shaping Poland's government after the war and was supported by the Soviet Union."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the following context:  The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden.

However, it could have potential indirect effects on the overall process. The pancreas plays a critical role in regulating blood sugar levels by secreting insulin and glucagon. If the pancreas is more reactive, it could potentially lead to issues with blood sugar regulation, such as diabetes. Diabetes and other blood sugar regulation issues might impact sexual health and reproductive capacity for both men and women in various ways. For example: 1. Diabetes can cause erectile dysfunction in men, which could make it difficult to engage in sexual activity and mate with a woman. 2. Women with diabetes may experience irregular periods, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or other hormonal imbalances, which could affect their ability to conceive. 3. Pregnant women with diabetes need to manage their blood sugar levels carefully, as uncontrolled diabetes during pregnancy can increase the risk of complications, such as premature birth, congenital anomalies, and high birth weight.

Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, a U.N. official tells CNN.      The Saudi-led coalition -- made up of several Arab countries -- began a military campaign in Yemen in March 2015 aimed at preventing Houthi rebels allied to Iran and forces loyal to Yemen's deposed President Ali Abdullah Saleh from taking power.      But last month, a U.N. report claimed the alliance was responsible for 60% of the 1,953 children recorded as killed or maimed in the conflict in 2015 -- a sixfold rise since the previous year. They were added to a blacklist of of groups violating children's rights in armed conflict, before dropping off the list again earlier this week.      That's because Saudi Arabia made a threat of a \\"total rupture\\" in relations between the Kingdom and the U.N., placing in doubt hundreds of millions of dollars in financial contributions to U.N. humanitarian agencies and causes, the U.N. official said.      Read More ||||| U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon publicly acknowledged Thursday that he removed the Saudi-led coalition currently bombing Yemen from a blacklist of child killers — 72 hours after it was published — due to a financial threat to defund United Nations programs.      The secretary-general didn’t name the source of the threat, but news reports have indicated it came directly from the Saudi government.      The U.N.’s 2015 “Children and Armed Conflict” report originally listed the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen under “parties that kill or maim children” and “parties that engage in attacks on schools and/or hospitals.” The report, which was based on the work of U.N. researchers in Yemen, attributed 60 percent of the 785 children killed and 1,168 injured to the bombing coalition.      After loud public objections from the Saudi government, Ban said on Monday that he was revising the report to “review jointly the cases and numbers cited in the text,” in order to “reflect the highest standards of accuracy possible.”      But on Thursday, he described his real motivation. “The report describes horrors no child should have to face,” Ban said at a press conference. “At the same time, I also had to consider the very real prospect that millions of other children would suffer grievously if, as was suggested to me, countries would defund many U.N. programs. Children already at risk in Palestine, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and so many other places would fall further into despair.”      Saudi Arabia is one of the U.N.’s largest donors in the Middle East, giving hundreds of millions of dollars a year to U.N. food programs in Syria and Iraq. In 2014, Saudi Arabia gave 500 million — the largest single humanitarian donation to the U.N. — to help Iraqis displaced by ISIS. Over the past three years, Saudi Arabia has also been become the third-largest donor to the U.N.’s relief agency in Palestine, giving tens of millions of dollars to help rebuild Gaza and assist Palestinian refugees.      “It is unacceptable for member states to exert undue pressure,” the secretary-general said. “Scrutiny is a natural and necessary part of the work of the United Nations.”      Ban called the decision “one of the most painful and difficult decisions I have had to make.”      Saudi Ambassador to the U.N. Abdallah al-Mouallimi, who held his own press conference afterward, offered his own back-handed confirmation of what happened. “We didn’t use threats,” he said, “but such listing will obviously have an impact on our relations with the U.N.”      “It is not in our style, it is not in our genes, it is not in our culture to use threats and intimidation,” he concluded.      Ban has invited a team from the Saudi-led coalition to New York to conduct a “joint review” ahead of scheduled U.N. discussions on the report, scheduled for August.      On Monday, however, after the changes were announced, the Saudi ambassador to the U.N. declared that the changes were “final and unconditional” and that Saudi Arabia had been “vindicated.”      Related: ||||| As organizations working to protect the rights of children and health workers in armed conflict, we are shocked by your decision announced on June 6, 2016 to remove the Saudi Arabia-led Coalition from the “list of shame” annexed to your published 2016 annual report to the United Nations Security Council on children and armed conflict, “pending the conclusions of [a] joint review” of the cases and numbers included in the text.      The evidence of grave violations against children in Yemen by the Saudi-led Coalition is overwhelming. The UN Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism, which operates at multiple levels and gathers, reviews, and verifies information from all relevant UN agencies operating in a country, has documented over a thousand children killed and injured as a result of Saudi-led aerial attacks in Yemen, as well as dozens of airstrikes on schools and hospitals. The listing was based on this information.      These findings come in the context of widespread violations of international humanitarian law by Coalition forces in Yemen over the past year. The UN Panel of Experts identified 119 separate coalition sorties that it determined were unlawful. Nongovernmental organizations have similarly documented over 50 cases of indiscriminate or disproportionate airstrikes against civilian objects, including houses, markets, schools, hospitals, and clinics, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of children. Although the exact numbers may be disputed, the responsibility of the Saudi-led coalition for grave violations against children in many of these attacks is not in doubt. Moreover, Saudi Arabia and other Coalition members have shown no willingness to credibly investigate alleged war crimes, as they are obligated to do under international humanitarian law.      Since the Secretary-General’s “list of shame” was first instituted in 2002, it has been an invaluable tool in efforts to curb violations against children in armed conflict. By stigmatizing perpetrators, whether governments or non-state armed groups, the list creates pressure on parties to armed conflict to comply with international law. Over 20 governments and armed groups have signed UN action plans and taken steps to end violations against children in order to be considered for “de-listing.”      Your decision to remove the Saudi-led Coalition from the list – even temporarily pending “review” – following protests by the Saudi government sets a damaging precedent and undermines the list’s credibility. It sends a message to parties to armed conflict that if they apply sufficient political pressure, they can manipulate their exclusion from the list and avoid scrutiny and accountability. Instead, your message should be that all parties to armed conflict—without exception-- are held to the same standard, and that the only route to de-listing is by ending violations against children.      If the Saudi-led Coalition wants to be removed from the list, it should stop killing and maiming children and bombing schools and hospitals in Yemen—the violations for which it was listed.      By capitulating to the demands of Saudi Arabia, you undermine your Human Rights Up Front initiative and taint your legacy as a proponent of human rights. We urge you to place the Saudi-led Coalition back on the list annexed to your report, and state publicly that your office is committed to an impartial list, based on evidence, not politics. Children whose lives are devastated by armed conflict deserve nothing less.

The context here is that the Saudi Arabia-led coalition was named in an annex to an annual report that is prepared by the Ban Ki Moon’s Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict. The report surveys conflicts around the world in which children are particularly at risk, either because they are serving as child soldiers or the are victims of armed conflict. The report compiles data on the impact of various conflicts on children and adopts a name-and-shame policy of identifying armed groups that are particularly injurious to children.      The annex in question lists “parties that recruit or use children, kill or maim children, commit rape and other forms of sexual violence against children, or engage in attacks on schools and/or hospitals, or abduct children in situations of armed conflict on the agenda of the Security Council.” In addition to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition, four other parties to the conflict in Yemen were named, including Al Qaeda and Houthi rebels.      The report offered evidence to back up this designation, saying that 60% of all child casualties could be attributed to the Saudi-led coalition.      The United Nations verified a sixfold increase in the number of children killed and maimed compared with 2014, totalling 1,953 child casualties (785 children killed and 1,168 injured). More than 70 per cent were boys. Of the casualties, 60 per cent (510 deaths and 667 injuries) were attributed to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition and 20 per cent (142 deaths and 247 injuries) to the Houthis. In 324 incidents, the responsible party could not be identified. ISIL claimed responsibility for an improvised explosive device attack on a mosque in Amanat al-Asimah that killed seven children and injured six, in addition to causing many adult casualties. Of the child casualties, 60 per cent were caused by air strikes, predominantly in Amanat al-Asimah, Hajjah and Sa‘dah. Significant civilian casualties, including children, as a result of air strikes continued to be documented early in 2016. Ground fighting accounted for 29 per cent of child casualties, with the vast majority in Ta ‘izz, Aden and Dali‘. Child casualties as a result of landmines and explosive remnants of war were documented, with 15 children killed and 67 injured in Abyan, Aden, Amanat al-Asimah, Amran, Bayda’, Dali‘, Dhamar, Lahij, Ma’rib, Sa‘dah, Shabwah and Ta‘izz.      Despite this evidence, Saudi Arabia vigorously protested being included in the blacklist. This apparently led to an unusual statement by Ban Ki Moon on Monday, saying that Saudi Arabia would be dropped from the annex, pending a review. That decision faced widespread criticism from human rights groups. Then, yesterday, Colum Lynch reported in Foreign Policy that Saudi Arabia has put the heavy squeeze on Ban Ki Moon.      Saudi Arabia threatened this week to break relations with the United Nations and cut hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to its humanitarian relief and counterterrorism programs to strong-arm the U.N. into removing Riyadh and its allies from a blacklist of groups that are accused of harming children in armed conflict…In their Monday warning, senior Saudi diplomats told top U.N. officials Riyadh would use its influence to convince other Arab governments and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to sever ties with the United Nations, the officials said.      And now, in the statement to the press today, Ban Ki Moon confirmed that, indeed, countries had threatened to withdraw funding from humanitarian agencies to protest Saudi Arabia’s inclusion on the blacklist. Ban Ki Moon candidly admitted to caving to this pressure in order to prevent children already at risk from “falling into further despair.”      My latest report on children and armed conflict has documented the harrowing situation of Yemen’s children. There has been fierce reaction to my decision to temporarily remove the Saudi-led Coalition countries from the report’s annex. This was one of the most painful and difficult decisions I have had to make. The report describes horrors no child should have to face. At the same time, I also had to consider the very real prospect that millions of other children would suffer grievously if, as was suggested to me, countries would de-fund many UN programmes. Children already at risk in Palestine, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen and so many other places would fall further into despair. It is unacceptable for Member States to exert undue pressure. Scrutiny is a natural and necessary part of the work of the United Nations.      It’s worth nothing that Saudi Arabia is a key funder of UN humanitarian agencies, most importantly it is the fourth largest funder of the United Nations entity that provides relief for Palestinian refugees. This was a threat that could not be easily be dismissed. (For its part, Saudi Arabia denies that it threatened to break ties with the UN.)      This is a situation where Ban Ki Moon has little recourse but to rely on the support of UN member states to back him up. This is, after all, a list that member states asked him to create. Back in 2001, the Security Council adopted a resolution requesting an annual report from the office of the Secretary General that lists armed groups that routinely violate the rights of children. That is what he did. And now, he is coming under fire for it.      Discussion      comments... ||||| Last summer, Mr. Ban reversed course on his list of armies and guerrilla groups that violated child rights in war. In that instance, his special representative for children and armed conflict, Leila Zerrougui, recommended that the Israel Defense Forces and Hamas be included on the list for their role in bombing schools and hospitals and otherwise breaking international law during the 50-day war in the Gaza Strip in 2014.      Israel was consulted before the release of the report, Mr. Ban’s aides said at the time, and both Israeli and American diplomats lobbied intensely against the listing. In the end, both Israel and Hamas were kept off the list. Mr. Ban declined to address reporters’ questions on the matter at the time, leaving it to his envoy, Ms. Zerrougui, to explain the redaction.      The generally risk-averse Mr. Ban has tried to step out a bit more during his last year, but he has also repeatedly had to step back.      In March, on a rare visit to a camp that houses refugees from Western Sahara, Mr. Ban used the term “occupation” to refer to Morocco’s 1975 annexation of territory that the Sahrawis claim as theirs. The Moroccan government responded by ejecting dozens of United Nations staff members, effectively kneecapping the peacekeeping mission there.      Morocco has a powerful ally in France, a veto-wielding member of the Security Council, which helps explain why the Security Council said nothing to persuade Morocco to reverse its decision. That left Mr. Ban on his own, and within days, his spokesman was compelled to swallow his words.      “We regret the misunderstandings and consequences that this personal expression of solicitude provoked,” said the spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric.      Perhaps Mr. Ban’s most awkward moment came when he sought to act independently of the United States. In January 2014, he invited Iran to United Nations-brokered political negotiations over Syria, only to be advised by American officials to rescind the invitation, according to interviews with diplomats at the time. ||||| A diplomatic feud between Saudi Arabia and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is escalating. The U.N. chief says the kingdom pressured him into removing the Saudi coalition in Yemen from a blacklist of entitites that harm children during conflicts.            “It is unacceptable for member states to exert undue pressure,” Ban told reporters Thursday, in reference to the U.N. report published earlier this week that listed the Saudi Arabia-led coalition as one of the parties that “kill and maim children” and “engage in attacks on schools and/or hospitals.”      Annual blacklist            The Saudis were quick to admonish the United Nations for putting them and their allies on the annual blacklist that includes shady governments such as Bashar al-Assad’s in Syria and Omar al-Bashir’s in Sudan and the Islamic State terror group.      Credible reports surfaced that the Saudis and other coalition members threatened to pull their funding from U.N. agencies and humanitarian operations if they were not de-listed, a move that could cripple already cash-strapped life-saving programs, including many serving Arabs and Muslims.      Ban appeared to confirm those reports Thursday, telling reporters, “I also had to consider the very real prospect that millions of other children would suffer grievously if, as was suggested to me, countries would de-fund many U.N. programs.”      Horrors children face      FILE - A young boy who lost his leg in the Yemen war uses a prosthetic limb at a government-run rehabilitation center in Sanaa, Yemen on March 5, 2016.      The U.N. chief said the report on children in armed conflict described “horrors no child should have to face” in Yemen and that it was “one of the most painful and difficult decisions I have had to make” in removing the coalition from the black list. But he insisted the United Nations stands by the report and will not change its content.      Saudi Ambassador Abdallah al-Mouallimi strongly rejected characterizations that his government had extorted the secretary-general into removing them from the list.      Ban took the coalition off the list on Monday. The U.N. says the removal is pending a review and further consultations with Riyadh; the Saudis have said it is permanent.      “I want to reassure you,” the Saudi envoy told reporters, “it is not in our style, it is not in our genes, it is not in our culture, to use threats and intimidation.” He added, “We did not exercise pressure or intimidation. We made our point clear; we made it firmly.”      Saudi removal, pending review            The Saudis and other Gulf Arab members of the coalition that are fighting Iranian-backed Shi’ite Houthi rebels in Yemen donate hundreds of millions of dollars to U.N. programs, including UNRWA which assists Palestinian refugees and UNICEF. Saudi Arabia is also the third biggest funder of the U.N. humanitarian appeal for Yemen, having pledged more than 46 million for 2016.      FILE - Infant Udai Faisal, who died from acute malnutrition on March 24, is one of thousands of Yemeni children who are suffering from hunger as one of the most horrific consequence of the Yemeni conflict and the naval blockade and airstrikes by the Saudi-led coaltion.      The report says that nearly 2,000 Yemeni children were killed or injured in 2015, and attributed 60 percent of those casualties to the Saudi-led coalition. The Saudi envoy has called that figure “wildly inaccurate.” The United nations also says that of the 101 verified attacks on schools and hospitals, the Saudi-led coalition is responsible for nearly half.      The Children in Armed Conflict Report often irritates governments that are included in it. Last year, the U.N. found itself in a similar situation, as it sought to list Israel for the deaths of nearly 500 Palestinian children in the Gaza war of 2014. Israel succeeded in preventing having its name added to the blacklist before the report’s publication, but was roundly criticized by human rights and Arab groups. |||||Summary:","output":"A diplomatic feud between the United Nations and Saudi Arabia is escalating after it was revealed that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had included the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen on a blacklist of those that have harmed children during conflicts in a UN report. The blacklist also included ISIS. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates immediately threatened to cut their funding to UN relief agencies and programmes if they were not removed from the list, which they argue would hamper the UN's life-saving capabilities. Latin American nations have reportedly urged the UN to draft a resolution to back Ban, while others have made it clear they will not risk good relations with wealthy Gulf countries over such a resolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Their first show was at the Batschkapp Club in Frankfurt in February 1984. The band then consisted of Mike Scott on vocals and guitar, Anthony Thistlethwaite on saxophone and mandolin, Wallinger on keyboards, Roddy Lorimer on trumpets, Martyn Swain on bass and Kevin Wilkinson on drums. John Caldwell from Another Pretty Face also played guitar, and Scottish singer Eddi Reader sang backing vocals for the band's first two concerts. The band made some new recordings and over-dubbed old material in late 1983 and early 1984 which were released as The Waterboys' second album, A Pagan Place, in June 1984. The \\"official\\" Waterboys line-up at this time, according to the sleeve of A Pagan Place, was Scott, Thistlethwaite, Wallinger and Wilkinson, with guest contributions from Reader, Lorimer and many others.  A Pagan Place was preceded by the single The Big Music. \\"The Big Music\\", the name of the single's A-side track, was adopted by some commentators as a description of The Waterboys' sound, and is still used to refer to the musical style of their first three albums. The release of the album was followed by further touring including support for The Pretenders and U2 and a show at the Glastonbury Festival.  The band began to record new material in early 1985 for a new album, with Wilkinson leaving the band to join China Crisis. Late in the sessions future Waterboy Steve Wickham added his violin to the track The Pan Within; he had been invited after Scott had heard him on a Sinead O'Connor demo recorded at Karl Wallinger's house.  The Waterboys (officially a trio of Scott, Thistlethwaite and Wallinger with a slew of guests) released their third album, This Is the Sea, in October 1985. It sold better than either of the two earlier albums, and managed to get into the Top Forty. A single from it, \\"The Whole of the Moon\\", reached number 26 in the UK. Promotion efforts were hampered by Scott's refusal to perform on Top of the Pops, which insisted that its performers lip sync. (However, in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines, when the New Wave era started around this period, the group's biggest hit single out of this third album was \\"The Pan Within\\", aside from \\"The Whole of the Moon\\" and \\"Don't Bang The Drum\\".) The album release was followed by successful tours of the UK and North America with Wickham becoming a full-time member, Marco Sin replacing Martyn Swain on bass, and Chris Whitten replacing Kevin Wilkinson on drums.

A herd can go through a forest quietly. It travels in a single line. It goes about 6 miles an hour. When frightened, it may run at about 25 miles an hour. When they reach water, elephants swim across. They are great swimmers.     Elephants eat grass, leaves, small branches, and bark. They particularly like the tender leaves on the top of trees. How do they get these leaves? They use their heads to knock trees down. They can easily knock down a 30-foot tree. Elephants also eat berries, mangoes, coconuts, corn, and sugar cane. They love salt. A wild male adult eats 500 to 600 pounds of food a day.     Many people want to find the graveyards   of elephants. There is a strong belief that such graveyards exist. Here is why. Bones and tusks of dead elephants have almost never been found. Searches have been made in forests. Grassy plains have been searched too. But neither bones nor tusks are found. Elephants don't live forever. Where are their bones? They don't just bury themselves. Here is one belief. When an elephant gets sick or old, it instinctively knows death is near. It leaves the herd. It goes off to a secret graveyard. The place is known only to elephants, and perhaps other animals, but not to humans. Obviously, such a graveyard would be filled with tusks. These were once very valuable. The objective of explorers was to find this \\"gold\\" mine. This graveyard belief may be a truth or a myth. But it is romantic. It would be nice if it were true.

Ann Moore introduced the idea of a baby carrier to American people nearly 50 years ago. Ann spent two years in Africa in the early 1960s. She worked as a nurse there. Ann saw babies wrapped in bright cloth tied to their mothers' backs. The babies snuggled   close to their mothers, and the mothers could use their hands to do other things. In 1964, Ann had her own baby. She tried making a carrier like the one African mothers used. The carrier was like a backpack. Everywhere Ann went with her baby in the carrier, people asked, \\"Where can I buy one?\\" In 1965, Ann and her mother began to sell handmade carriers. Ann received a patent   for the baby carrier in 1969. By that time, the baby carrier had leg holes and straps   that could be made longer or shorter. It could also be worn on the back or front. By 1979, the baby carriers were made in a factory. These baby carriers cost less to make and more than 25,000 were sold every month. When Ann made her first baby carrier, she just wanted to keep her baby close and still have her hands free to do other things.

Before you can begin to overcome a fear of success, you have to understand what success means to you. Even though it may be tough to pinpoint specifically what being successful means to you, doing this will help you understand exactly what it is you’re fearing.   Be sure to identify your vision for personal and professional success. Ask yourself, “What does success look and feel like to me? How will I know if I’m successful? What will I do and how will I act when I’m successful?” Write down as your answers to these questions. Include answers that may not seem to relate to success if they pop into your head. For example, if you think “Success looks like luxury,” write that. Be as specific as possible. For example, instead of writing, “If I have a lot of money I’ll know I’m successful,” write something like, “I’ll know I’m successful when I have 10 million in savings.” Sometimes when we are afraid we can recognize the feeling, but not still understand exactly what we’re afraid of. In order to overcome your fear, you have to ask yourself what specifically you are afraid of and where the fear cam from. Once you know what you’re really afraid of, you can work to overcome your fear.   Try asking yourself, “Am I fearful of this because someone put it in my head? Or, is it based on past mistakes or failures?” If the fear is truly unfounded, this may help you let go of it. Look over your list of definitions of success. Think about each item on the list and how you feel about it. For instance, if success is winning a football championship, how will you feel if you do win? Write a few words that describe how you feel about each item. For instance, if you wrote “success is graduating,” you might write, “means I’m not a child anymore; makes me nervous about responsibilities.” Pay attention to signs of success that give you negative feelings. For example, if you listed financial security as a sign of success and you noted it makes you think of loneliness, you may want to explore why this is. Being honest with yourself about just how your fear of success is holding you back is one way to overcome it. Take some time to think about specific ways in which your fear of success is limiting your potential and your future success.  Write down examples of how you have sabotaged yourself. For instance, you might write, “I procrastinated on my report.” Also, write about what might have happened if you hadn’t let your fear hold you back. For example, you may write something like, “I could have gotten the raise and afford the vacation I want.” Take a moment to thoroughly visualize yourself succeeding. Positive visualizations may help to eliminate your fear. Writing a short statement declaring that you aren’t going to let fear stop you from succeeding and reaching your goals any more is a concrete way to overcome your fear. Doing this can help you improve your self-confidence, as well as remind you that your fear of success doesn’t control your life.  Write a sentence or two along the lines of, “I am not a victim of my fear. I am not afraid of success. I will be successful and I will enjoy it.” Read your statement out-loud on a regular basis. For instance, you might read it before work each morning or before a major presentation. You can also read your declaration to an accountability partner who can help keep you focused on your goal. You may be more likely to follow through with things if someone is holding you accountable.","output":"The article helps you understand and overcome your fear of success by defining what success means to you, finding the roots of your fear, recognizing how it holds you back, and using positive visualization and declarations to build self-confidence and take control of your life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This scenario presents a completely different situation in which the girl is sleeping. This implies that she is not conscious, and, thus, she is not actively doing anything, including her homework. Analyzing the two statements, we can see that the hypothesis does not stem from the premise, meaning that these two scenarios are not related in a cause-and-effect manner. The occurrence of the premise (the girl working on her homework) does not directly lead to the hypothesis (the girl sleeping). Moreover, it's impossible for the girl to be both working on her homework and sleeping at the same time, as these are mutually exclusive states. However, it's important to note there are situations where the premise and the hypothesis can coexist, although not simultaneously. For example, if the scene is considered on a timeline, it is plausible that a girl who was initially working on her homework eventually becomes tired and falls asleep. In this case, it would be understandable that at one point in time, she was working as described in the premise, and at another point in time, she is sleeping as suggested by the hypothesis. In conclusion, given the premise that a young girl is working on her homework at a table, we cannot directly conclude that the hypothesis indicating that she is sleeping is true. The two statements portray separate scenarios and do not establish a cause-and-effect relation. However, it is important to consider the context in which these scenarios appear, as over time, it's possible the girl transitions from working on her homework to sleeping."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Other Mars Meteorite The most famous Mars meteorite, the Allen Hills rock with its strange, cylindrical rock segments, may not be the most intriguing.     Astrobiology Magazine -- Perhaps the most famous of the martian meteorites was discovered at Allen Hills, Antarctica, and spawned a controversy about fossil-shapes and whether Mars could once have supported more favorable conditions than today... Multi-choice problem: What is this text about? Pick from: a). World b). Sports c). Business d). Science/Tech","output":"This text is about d). Science/Tech. The given text excerpt discusses the topic of Mars meteorites, specifically focusing on the Allen Hills rock, which is a well-known and intriguing Martian meteorite. This topic falls under the category of Science/Tech as it pertains to the fields of astrobiology, planetary sciences, and the geological study of extraterrestrial rocks. Mars meteorites are essentially space rocks that have been ejected from the surface of Mars due to collisions with other celestial bodies such as asteroids. Some of these Martian meteorites, after traveling through space for a certain duration, ultimately land on Earth's surface. The Allen Hills rock, also known as the Allan Hills 84001 (ALH84001), was discovered in Antarctica and has since led to debates regarding its peculiar fossil-shapes and whether or not Mars could have supported more favorable conditions in the past than it does today. This particular meteorite has garnered significant attention from scientists and researchers due to its potential implications for the presence of life on Mars in the past. By studying these Martian rocks, researchers aim to gain a deeper understanding of the Red Planet's history and its potential to host living organisms. Furthermore, the exploration of Mars meteorites and the study of astrobiology contribute to our overall knowledge of the origins and the evolution of life in the universe. Given the nature of the text and its implications for scientific research, it is most closely related to the Science/Tech category, as opposed to the other categories provided (World, Sports, and Business)."},{"instruction":"Select from the following.

His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers, a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping. Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs. However, in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets, Truman was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon. Indeed, Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese, writing, \\"First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon.\\" Initially, Eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the Soviets. He even visited Warsaw in 1945. Invited by Bolesław Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration, he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city. However, by mid-1947, as East–West tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated, Eisenhower gave up and agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion. Now answer this question: Who was Chief of Staff of the Army before Eisenhower?","output":"Before Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Chief of Staff of the Army was General George C. Marshall. He served in this position from September 1, 1939, to November 18, 1945, before being succeeded by Eisenhower. As Chief of Staff during World War II, Marshall played a significant role in organizing and coordinating the efforts of the United States and its allies against the Axis powers. He later served as the United States Secretary of State and was instrumental in developing and implementing the Marshall Plan, which aimed at rebuilding post-war Europe."},{"instruction":"Context: Casey broke the iPod, and therefore, Casey cost Jan many dollars.

And unfortunately some of them clash with the others.  Secondly, several segments feel underdeveloped to me. Like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition. I'm not talking about happy endings here (or even an ending period) but rather, they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in.

But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: You'll need to get in basic shape before you can start really toning your muscles. If you move directly into intense exercise, you're much more likely to get overwhelmed and quit or even injure yourself. Start building your endurance by getting off the couch and being active in your everyday life. Take the stairs when you have the choice. Stand instead of sit while you use the computer or study. Walk to places that are a mile or less from your location, instead of taking the car. Go for a relaxing walk or jog instead of watching TV. There are lots of ways to get active in your everyday life without even exercising. Burpees look complex but they're actually easy once you get used to the motions and they're one of the best full body workouts that you can do. Start in a standing position, feet apart. Put your hands down on the ground in front of your feet, jump your legs back so that you go into a push-up position, and do a push-up. Now, jump your feet back, then lift your hands above your head and jump straight up as high as you can. Repeat for at least 10 minutes. You can skip either the push-up or the jump, but both really add to the effectiveness of the exercise, so it is not recommended. Planks are one of the more efficient exercises you can do, significantly increasing the strength of your core muscles and legs in much less time than other core exercises. Start by getting into a push-up position.  Now, lower your body so that instead of resting your weight on your hands, your whole forearm is resting on the ground instead. Just hold that position, with your back and legs as straight as possible, for as long as you can. You should try to hold this position for as long as you can, but you should know that holding it for a minute or more takes very strong core muscles. Start out holding the position for 10 seconds, resting for 30 seconds, and then repeating for about 10 minutes. Slowly work your way up to holding the position for 30 seconds to a minute. Squats work your core muscles and your legs, and can even work your arms if you lift small weights while you do them. A squat is done by standing with your feet about a shoulder's width apart and then crouching down, as if you're sitting in an invisible chair. Keep your back straight in order to do this exercise correctly. If you're new to squats, using a chair or table to balance can make it much easier. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is that in order to tone muscles effectively, it's essential to first build a basic level of fitness and endurance through integrating physical activity into daily life. Activities like taking stairs, standing, and walking can help achieve this. Once prepared, exercises such as burpees, planks, and squats can be incorporated to provide full-body workouts, build core strength, and improve fitness. These exercises are versatile and scalable to different fitness levels. Starting with shorter durations and fewer repetitions, individuals can progress gradually to build muscle strength and avoid injuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Stan moved from the US to Australia, and he still gets confused because of the seasons in the southern hemisphere and the fact that they use the same calendar as the rest of the world.  Which month is colder in the northern hemisphere, July or January?  Hint: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux.

As mentioned in the hint, the Northern Hemisphere receives more direct sunlight and experiences warmer temperatures during May, June, and July because it faces the Sun during these months.
