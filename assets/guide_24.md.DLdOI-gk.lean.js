A love-struck former rugby star and his model bride-to-be have become a YouTube hit with a video he created of his surprise proposal on an Italian island. Garth Chamberlain, originally from Zimbabwe but now living in London, spent weeks secretly planning how he would pop the question to his girlfriend of three years, Swedish-born Tess Montgomery. With the help of Tess' modelling agency, MOT Models, he faked a booking for her to do a modelling job at a luxury hotel on the island of Favigana near Sicily. He had secretly flown the 1,000 miles to the same location to surprise her and set up secret cameras to film the whole thing. Scroll down for video. Romantic: Garth popped the question to Tess on an Italian island after planning an elaborate proposal. Plan in action: Garth had arranged for Tess to visit the Cas'almare Hotel in Favigana on what she thought was a modelling job. She's seen here arriving for the 'shoot' Meanwhile... Garth had arrived earlier and, with the help of staff, set up the terrace for a romantic meal with a stunning view (and put cameras in place to capture it all) Surprise! When Tess arrives on the terrace, Garth hides while she's given an iPad with a video he filmed earlier of why she's really there. When Tess, 30, arrived she was handed an iPad by the hotel staff on which Garth, 28, who used to play for London Wasps, had recorded her a video message. The footage included shots of where they first met in Wandsworth, London, and dozens of romantic photos of the couple together on their. adventures around the world. It also revealed how Garth, who now works as a project manager for construction company ISG, had travelled all the way to Sweden for a day to formally ask Tess's father, Holger, for this daughter's hand in marriage. The beginning: The video included a shot of where they first met at a pub in Wandsworth, London. ... and pictures of their adventures together around the world. Traditional: The video also revealed how Garth had travelled all the way to Sweden (without Tess knowing) to ask her father's permission for her hand in marriage. After Tess had watched the video, Garth then surprised her by stepping out on the terrace and going down on one knee. Tess is seen sobbing with delight as she gladly accepts his proposal. Tess wrote on her blog afterwards how it was all a wonderful surprise. She said: 'I can say that it was quite a shock. to be booked on a job and end up in the middle of a marriage proposal. instead. Garth had been planning this since sometime in March and. received help from my good bookers at MOT, so I really could not. imagine. 'I have no idea how they managed to keep everything secret so. long. That he could go to Sweden and back without me even noticing?' She added: 'I was stunned - Garth made the most romantic proposal in the world and I am one very lucky lady.' Proposal: After she's watched the video, Garth then stuns Tess by appearing on the terrace and going down on one knee. She said yes! The couple then celebrate as the sun sets. Garth told the MailOnline that all the hard planning and travelling to make the proposal perfect was worth it. He said: 'I wanted to take Tess away to propose in a romantic location, one of the classics, but since we hadn't been on a holiday in a while I knew she would be suspicious. 'I wanted to ask her Dad, Holger's, permission and didn't quite know how to do that, after many failed plans and attempts, it culminated in me booking a next day flight over to Stockholm, a half hour stopover and then a reverse journey back to London to avoid suspicions of me being out of the country. I'm glad I did that, I know it means a lot to Holger and apart for a crazy journey, totally worth it. 'Then I came up with the idea of booking her on a 'fake' job, with a lot of help from her entire agency at MOT Models, we came up with the perfect disguise, we managed to get her over to Italy after a little stopover flight, so I could get there before her and set everything up. 'Elena and Sonia at Cas'almare (the hotel) helped with everything that side and before I had time to breathe she was arriving and I spent the time in the hotel's basement hiding away in preparation for Tess to come down to meet the crew for her shoot... then she got the iPad...' Delighted: Tess couldn't wait to call her friends and family and tell them the good news. Tying the knot: The couple will wed in December in Zimbabwe. Ruse: Tess's agency MOT Models helped Garth plan the surprise. Tess said she and her friends and family were 'choked' by the lengths Garth went to in order to pop the question. She added: 'My family is of course. over the moon, I have four younger sisters who love it - their. boyfriends, maybe not so much!' As Tess knows Garth loves to film and take pictures - mostly so they can share what they are up to with friends and family around the world - she was not surprised when she discovered he had recorded their proposal. 'I'm so glad he filmed everything, because. now we have something to revisit when we want and that we can show our. children in the future,' she said. The original plan had been to only show the video to their friends and family and play it at their wedding, which will take place on New Year's Eve in Zimbabwe. But they then decided to share it on YouTube - where it was already received more than 13,000 hits - and Tess said they have been 'overwhelmed' by the response from well-wishers.

Summarize this article: Mr Arpaio, 85, was found guilty after he defied a court order to stop traffic patrols targeting suspected immigrants. He was due to be sentenced in October. The president had hinted at the pardon  at a rally in Phoenix on Tuesday. Thanking the president, Mr Arpaio said his conviction was \\"a political witch hunt by holdovers in the Obama justice department\\". \\"Thank you.... for seeing my conviction for what it is,\\" tweeted Mr Arpaio. \\"I'm not going away,\\" he said, while declining to say whether he would run for sheriff again. Mr Trump has frequently praised the former sheriff, who is known for his controversial hard-line stance on immigration. Mr Arpaio appeared on the campaign trail with Mr Trump in 2016 - describing him as \\"the law-and-order candidate\\". In a statement announcing the pardon, his first, Mr Trump said: \\"Arpaio's life and career, which began at the age of 18 when he enlisted in the military after the outbreak of the Korean War, exemplify selfless public service. \\"Throughout his time as sheriff, Arpaio continued his life's work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration. \\"Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now 85 years old, and after more than 50 years of admirable service to our nation, he is a worthy candidate for a  presidential pardon.\\" Joe Arpaio, who styled himself as \\"America's toughest sheriff\\", rose to national prominence for his sweeps of undocumented immigrants in Hispanic communities, and for detaining Spanish-speakers under suspicion of being undocumented migrants. In July 2017, he was found guilty of violating a 2011 order to stop detaining migrants. The decision to pardon the former policeman was condemned by Democrats and civil rights groups. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy said it was \\"disheartening that [the president] set the bar so very low for his first pardon\\". Greg Stanton, the mayor of Phoenix, Arizona, called the move a slap in the face for the Latino community and those who had been victimised. End of Twitter post  by @ACLU Mr Arpaio, born in Springfield, Massachusetts, could have faced six months in jail at his sentencing in October. He served in the US military before he became a police officer - where he quickly acquired a reputation for his anti-immigration stance and tough enforcement tactics. The former sheriff lost a bid for re-election in Arizona's Maricopa County in November 2016, after 24 years in office. Mr Arpaio famously forced the prisoners to wear pink underwear and socks and old-fashioned black-and-white striped prison jumpsuits. The inmates lived outdoors while enduring sweltering Arizona desert temperatures. He also revived chain gangs, including a voluntary one for female prisoners.

When faced with this issue, most people believe they have no other option but to replace the entire cabinet door. However, replacing the hinges is often a simpler, more cost-effective solution. This article will provide a comprehensive guide on how to replace cabinet hinges efficiently and effectively. Step 1: Remove the Old Hinge Before heading to a home improvement store, begin by taking off your old hinge. Unscrew the hinge from the cabinet door and the frame using a screwdriver or drill. Ensure that you keep the screws in a safe place so you don't lose them. If the holes in the cabinet door or frame are damaged, you may need to fill them in with wood putty and sand them smooth. Step 2: Finding the Perfect Replacement Hinge With your old hinge in hand, visit a local home improvement store for a new hinge. The key is to ensure that the holes for the screws on the new hinge match the distance between those on the old hinge. This will guarantee compatibility and easy installation. Most hinges have standardized hole spacing, but it’s always best to double-check for accuracy. While selecting a hinge, consider the material, finish, and style that matches your existing hardware. Step 3: Installing the New Hinge on the Cabinet Door Once you have acquired the perfect replacement hinge, it's time to install it. Start by attaching the new hinge to the cabinet door using a screwdriver or drill. Tighten the screws securely but be cautious not to overtighten them, as this can cause the wood to crack or split. Step 4: Aligning the Cabinet Door and Frame At this point, it's wise to ask an assistant to help you hold the cabinet door against the frame. Align the door correctly, ensuring that it sits evenly within the frame and that it opens and closes without any obstructions. Step 5: Securing the New Hinge to the Cabinet Frame Lastly, set the new hinge over the holes for the old hinge in the cabinet frame. Again, use a screwdriver or drill to fix the new hinge securely to the frame. Check the door's alignment one final time and make any necessary adjustments to ensure a perfect fit. Conclusion: Replacing cabinet hinges need not be a complicated affair. With the right tools, patience, and precision, you can breathe new life into your cabinetry without the unnecessary expense of replacing entire cabinet doors. Moreover, this simple task can significantly improve the appearance and functionality of your cabinets, giving your space a fresh update."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this: The arrangement of plates and dielectric has many variations depending on the desired ratings of the capacitor. For small values of capacitance (microfarads and less), ceramic disks use metallic coatings, with wire leads bonded to the coating. Larger values can be made by multiple stacks of plates and disks. Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make the plates, and a dielectric film of impregnated paper or plastic – these are rolled up to save space. To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled-up plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates.

Context: I recall just one case of its kind. In my first year out of high school in college, I didn’t quite get along with one vocal pipsqueak of a guy. Mid-year one afternoon post-dismissal, a small white car drove past dangerously close to me and honked as I made my way to the bus stand home. If there had actually been any malice intended, I would have been caught out totally by surprise. The next day, he wondered aloud why I did not respond or react to him flippantly wanting to ram me with his car as he drove by. To think of it, I had already taken a swipe at another guy whom I suspected of being behind the wheel less than an hour earlier. Professing some half-hearted disinterest, I thought and felt to myself that this episode wasn’t over - yet. Fast forward some 45–60 days later, this guy is suddenly absent from college for almost a week. Successive class lecturers note that it is not like him to skip classes without a valid reason. Late on the second day of absence, another lecturer asks our class about him. “His car crashed.”, I state almost flippantly, with a weak spirit of retribution shining inside my gut. But as you would realize from answering this question it later turned out to be true. While driving at quite a clip near his home, he had barreled through a residential cross-junction and broadsided a delivery van that had charged through the open junction with no regulating traffic lights. The van ended up upside down on the road shoulder and his parents-issued car was out of commission for like, three weeks. He suffered a concussion and a shattered nasal septum from the impact and police issued the van driver a ticket for dangerous driving. Basically, he had joked about striking me with his car hit-and-run and I had later joked to that lecturer and the class that he had crashed his car - and it turned out I was right.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?

Q:I have a new situation: Uncle Tom and uncle Sam both have high cholesterol. Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and uncle Sam is not.  But I can use this background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.  What is an answer for this question: Which uncle takes an inhibitor that induces the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver? A:","output":"Based on the given background information, Uncle Tom is the one who takes an inhibitor that induces the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. This is because Uncle Tom is on statin drugs, which are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins work by increasing the levels of LDL receptors in the liver, stimulating the catabolism of plasma LDL and removing cholesterol from the blood, thus reducing the risk of atherosclerosis. Uncle Sam, on the other hand, is not taking statin drugs, so he does not take an inhibitor that induces LDL receptor expression in the liver."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After Wales women sealed ninth place in the hockey by thrashing Trinidad and Tobago 4-0 on Thursday, goalscorer Phoebe Richards posted a picture on Twitter. ‘Post-Commonwealth Games treats, muffins in the ice bath!’ was the accompanying message. Well deserved, ladies. BOUCHARD DIVES TO GLORIOUS FIFTH. Amid the excitement of Jack Laugher and Chris Mears’ gold medal in the men’s synchronised 3m springboard, the inspirational Maxim Bouchard slipped under the radar. Bouchard broke his arm, back, wrist and legs and split his head open when a 7m platform collapsed underneath him in 2010, and still has metal pins in his left arm. Bouchard and Ryan McCormick managed a fifth-place finish for Canada. ENGLAND SPOT ON AGAINST KIWIS. A penalty shootout was required for England’s women to reach Saturday’s hockey final. Lily Owsley gave England a first-half lead against New Zealand, but the Antipodeans levelled with a minute to go.

It will have the most flavor in this time period. For that reason, it's best to cut it right before you want to use it in your food. Try cutting dill with scissors instead of a knife when preparing it in the kitchen. It will be more flavorful. When looking at the plant, look for shoots going off the main stem at a perpendicular angle. Use small shears to cut the shoot about 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less above the joint. Cutting causes less damage to the plant, so it keeps it from decaying as fast if you're planning on storing it. Add 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of water to the bottom of a mason jar. Snip off the bottom of the stems on the dill, and place the dill stem-side down in the water. Cover it with a lid, if possible, and put it in the fridge.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A recent study suggests that teens' relationship with parents, friends and teachers may have a lot to do with why they don't get a good night's sleep. David Maume, a sociologist and sleep researcher, analyzed federal health data, which interviewed 974 teenagers when they were 12, and then again at 15. He found that family dynamics   have much to do with how well kids sleep. Teens, who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them, tended to sleep better. However, families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens' sleep. And problems at school also affected teens' sleep. Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep. As did good relationships with friends. Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night's sleep. These add up to what makes lots of sense: a general feeling of well-being helps teens sleep. If we're happy and contented, we're much more likely to sleep better than if we're sad and anxious. Now, of course, teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking. Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime, but also about limiting technology, kids slept better. It's a finding that seems obvious, but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers. Clearly, teenagers aren't getting 9 to 10 hours a night, which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep, including poor academic performance, colds and stress. The answer is:","output":"Question: According to the recent study mentioned in the article, what factors contribute to teenagers getting a better night's sleep?

(Associated Press)      Police officers stay in front of the temporay Oldenburg district court at the Weser Ems halls in Oldenburg, Germany, Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2018. A nurse serving a life sentence for two murders is going on trial on charges that he killed a further 100 patients at two hospitals in Germany. (Julian Stratenschulte/dpa... (Associated Press)      BERLIN (AP) — A former nurse accused of killing 100 patients at two hospitals in Germany over a decade ago told a court as his trial opened Tuesday that the charges against him are largely accurate.      Niels Hoegel, 41, is already serving a life sentence for murder. His trial in the northwestern city of Oldenburg began with a minute of silence for the patients.      Asked by presiding judge Sebastian Buehrmann whether the charges against him are largely true, Hoegel replied \\"yes,\\" news agency dpa reported. There are no formal pleas in the German legal system.      The murder charges stem from Hoegel's time at a hospital in Oldenburg between 1999 and 2002 and at another hospital in nearby Delmenhorst from 2003 to 2005. The alleged victims were aged between 34 and 96.      Hoegel was convicted in 2015 of two murders and two attempted murders. He said then that he intentionally brought about cardiac crises in some 90 patients in Delmenhorst because he enjoyed the feeling of being able to resuscitate them. He later told investigators that he also killed patients in Oldenburg.      Authorities subsequently investigated hundreds of deaths, exhuming bodies of former patients.      The Oldenburg state court is conducting the trial at a courtroom set up in a conference center, a venue chosen to accommodate a large number of co-plaintiffs and public interest in the proceedings.      Judge Buehrmann opened the proceedings by asking everyone present to stand for a minute of silence for the deceased patients.      \\"All of their relatives deserve that their memory be honored,\\" independently of whether or not Hoegel had anything to do with their deaths, Buehrmann said. \\"We will make every effort to seek the truth.\\"      He promised Hoegel a fair trial.      Hoegel told the court that he had a \\"protected\\" childhood, free of violence. He said his grandmother and his father, who were both nurses, had been his role models for going into the profession.      An additional conviction could affect Hoegel's possibility of parole, but there are no consecutive sentences in Germany. In general, people serving life sentences are considered for parole after 15 years.      \\"We have fought for four years for this trial and expect Hoegel to be convicted of another 100 killings,\\" said Christian Marbach, a representative of the patients' relatives. \\"The aim is for Hoegel to stay in custody as long as possible.\\"      The trial is scheduled to last until May.      Police have said that, if local health officials hadn't hesitated in alerting authorities, Hoegel could have been stopped earlier.      Authorities are pursuing criminal cases against former staff at the two medical facilities. ||||| A former nurse has admitted to killing 100 patients in his care, on the first day of his trial in the biggest serial killing case in Germany’s post-war history.      Niels Hoegel, 41, has already spent nearly a decade in prison on a life term for other patient deaths. He is accused of intentionally administering medical overdoses to victims so he could bring them back to life at the last moment.      As the proceedings opened in the northern city of Oldenburg, the presiding judge, Sebastian Buehrmann, asked whether the charges against him were accurate. Hoegel replied “yes”.      “What I have admitted took place,” he told the courtroom crowded with dozens of grieving relatives.      As the proceedings began Buehrmann said the main aim of the trial was to establish the full scope of the murder spree that was allowed to go unchecked for years at two German hospitals.      “We will do our utmost to learn the truth,” he said. “It is like a house with dark rooms – we want to bring light into the darkness.”      After a minute of silence for the victims, the bearded, heavyset Hoegel listened impassively, his head lowered, as public prosecutor Daniela Schiereck-Bohlmann read out the name of each dead patient and the charges against the defendant.      Prosecutors say at least 36 were killed at a hospital in Oldenburg where he worked, and about 64 more at a clinic in nearby Delmenhorst, between 2000 and 2005.      More than 130 bodies of patients who died on Hoegel’s watch have been exhumed. Investigators have said the case is “unprecedented in Germany to our knowledge”.      One of the more than 100 co-plaintiffs in the trial, Christian Marbach, said it was a scandal that Hoegel had been allowed to kill with impunity for so long without hospital authorities or law enforcement intervening.      “They had everything they needed [to stop him] – you don’t have to be Sherlock Holmes,” said Marbach, the grandson of one of the patients.      He later expressed surprise about Hoegel’s quick confession.      “I didn’t expect it to happen today,” he said. “We now have a chance to make some real progress.”      Hoegel was caught in 2005 while injecting a patient in Delmenhorst with an unprescribed medication. He was sentenced in 2008 to seven years in prison for attempted murder.      A second trial followed in 2014-15 under pressure from families of his alleged victims, who accused prosecutors of dragging their feet.      He was found guilty of murder and attempted murder of five other victims and given the maximum sentence of 15 years.      It was then that Hoegel confessed to his psychiatrist of at least 30 more murders that he committed in Delmenhorst. That prompted investigators to take a closer look at suspicious deaths in Oldenburg.      Investigators say the final toll could be more than 200 but fear they might never know for sure because the bodies of many potential victims were cremated.      Hoegel appears to have followed a similar procedure each time, first injecting a medication that triggered cardiac arrest, followed by an often futile attempt at resuscitation.      Prosecutors say he was motivated by vanity, to show off his skills at saving lives, and by simple “boredom”.      The choice of victim appears to have been entirely random, with their ages ranging from 34 to 96.      Killing in itself was never his aim, according to one psychologist who evaluated him. When he managed to revive a patient, he was sated, but only for a few days, the expert said, adding: “For him, it was like a drug.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Former nurse Niels Hoegel, who is already serving a life sentence for two murders, admitted in court to killing 100 patients between 2000 and 2005 at two hospitals in Germany.

A relative told ABC News that Adam was \\"obviously not well.\\"      Mark Tambascio, another family friend, said he believed Lanza's mother, Nancy, had become increasingly concerned in the last few months about Lanza's emotional and behavioral issues. Lanza's parents divorced three years ago and his mother was left to deal Lanza alone.      \\"It was getting a little harder for her as time went on,\\" he said.      Divorce records obtained by ABC News revealed that Nancy was to \\"make all decisions\\" with respect to her son, but only after consulting with Lanza's father. The settlement awarded Nancy approximately a quarter million dollars a year in alimony but the documents do not mention any behavioral or mental health problems related to Adam Lanza.      Kyle Kromberg, another former classmate, said that Lanza could not keep eye contact with anyone.      \\"He hated looking at your eyes for more than a couple seconds,\\" Kromberg said. \\"He'd always look down at his papers or whatever he was doing.\\"      A former babysitter, Ryan Kraft, said Nancy told him never to leave Adam alone -- \\"Never even to the bathroom or turn your back on him at any time.\\"      On Friday morning, Lanza shot Nancy in the face at the home they shared in Newtown, and then drove her car to Sandy Hook Elementary School. Dressed in black combat gear, the 20-year-old broke a window at the school, which had recently had a new security system installed, and within minutes had shot and killed six adults and 20 schoolchildren between the ages of five and 10.      Police said Lanza used a Bushmaster semiautomatic assault-style rifle to kill the children before using a handgun to take his own life. Officials said the guns were likely legally purchased by Nancy.      Officials told ABC News that computers removed from Lanza's family home over the weekend provide important clues into Lanza's twisted thinking.

(Associated Press)      Paul Steinmetz, spokesman for the Danbury school, confirmed that Adam Lanza earned a 3.26 grade point average while a student there. He dropped out of a German language class and withdrew from a computer science class, but earned an A in a computer class, A-minus in American history and B in macroeconomics.      He participated when called on by the teacher in his evening course on introductory German, according to Dot Stasny, who was one of about a dozen other students in the class in the spring of 2009. She said she and a classmate once invited him out to a bar but he declined, saying he was only 17.      \\"We attributed him being quiet to him being so much younger than the rest of us,\\" said Stasny, 30. \\"I assumed he was this super smart kid who was just doing extra course work.\\"      Stasny said she saw him later when he came in as a customer at a video game store where she was working. She said she shared a laugh with him about how difficult the German class was. She told him she failed one of the exams, and he mentioned he got a D.      \\"I just remember him as a nice, quiet kid,\\" she said.      Steinmetz says Lanza was among a small group of 16-year-olds among the school's 5,000 undergraduates.      The Hartford Courant and The Wall Street Journal first reported Lanza's academic record at Western Connecticut State.      Steinmetz said Lanza took his last class in the summer of 2009 and didn't return. ||||| A man reacts at the site of a makeshift memorial for school shooting victims in Newtown, Conn., Sunday, Dec. 16, 2012.

(Associated Press)      THE INVESTIGATION: Twenty-year-old Adam Lanza, was carrying an arsenal of hundreds of rounds of deadly ammunition _ enough to kill nearly every student in the school if given enough time, authorities said, raising the specter the bloodbath could have been far worse. Lanza shot himself in the head when he heard police approaching the classroom where he was gunning down helpless children.      He had multiple, high-capacity clips each capable of holding 30 bullets, and the chief medical examiner said the ammunition was the type designed to break up inside a victim's body and inflict the maximum amount of damage, tearing apart bone and tissue.      The gunman shot his mother four times in the head before going to the school and gunning down 26 victims there.      THE VICTIMS: All the victims at the school were shot multiple times with a high-power rifle, some of them up close. All six adults were women. Of the 20 children, eight were boys and 12 were girls. All the children were 6 or 7 years old.      Among the dead were popular principal Dawn Hochsprung and school psychologist Mary Sherlach, who rushed toward Lanza in an attempt to stop him and paid with their lives; Victoria Soto, a 27-year-old teacher who died while trying to hide her pupils; 30-year-old Lauren Rousseau, a teacher thrilled to have been hired this year, and Ana Marquez-Greene, a 6-year-old girl who had just moved to Newtown from Canada.      THE GUNMAN: Lanza was described as a bright but painfully awkward student who seemed to have no close friends. In high school, he was active in the technology club. The club adviser remembered that he had \\"some disabilities\\" and seemed not to feel pain like the other students. That meant Lanza required special supervision when using soldering tools, for instance. He also had an occasional \\"episode\\" in which he seemed to withdraw completely from his surroundings, the adviser said.      Authorities said Lanza had no criminal history, and it was unclear whether he had a job.      THE SCENE: Families sought to comfort each other during Sunday church services and vigils devoted to impossible questions like that of a 6-year-old girl who asked her mother: \\"The little children, are they with the angels?\\"      Many of Newtown's 27,000 people wondered whether life could ever return to normal, and, as the workweek was set to begin, parents pondered whether to send their children back to school. Signs around town read, \\"Hug a teacher today,\\" \\"Please pray for Newtown\\" and \\"Love will get us through.\\"      THE PARENTS: One of the parents who lost a child in the attack spoke publicly about his loss.      Robbie Parker fought back tears and struggled to catch his breath as he described his 6-year-old daughter, Emilie, as a little girl who loved to draw. He also reserved surprisingly kind words for the gunman, saying he was not mad and offering sympathy for the gunman's family.      To the man's family, he said, \\"I can't imagine how hard this experience must be for you.\\"      THE GUNS: Federal authorities visited local gun ranges but found no evidence that the gunman trained for the attack or was an active member of the recreational gun community.      Investigators also have interviewed gun dealers trying to determine whether there was any training or other behavior that precipitated the attack.      THE HISTORY: The Newtown massacre is the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history and one of the deadliest mass shootings around the world. A gunman at Virginia Tech University killed 33, including himself, in 2007. Only Virginia Tech and the mass killings of 77 in Norway last year had greater death tolls across the world over the past 20 years. ||||| Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old who killed 20 children and six adults in a rampage at a Connecticut elementary school, and his mother both spent time at an area gun range, ABC News has learned.      A Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokesperson told ABC News investigators have determined Lanza did visit a gun range, but they have not determined whether he shot there.      Investigators have also learned his mother, Nancy Lanza, visited a gun range on multiple occasions, but they have not determined whether her son was with her during those visits, the spokesperson said.      ATF agents have been canvassing area gun ranges and gun dealers to learn whether Adam Lanza had been a customer or a visitor.      CLICK HERE for full coverage of the tragedy at the elementary school.      Law enforcement sources tell ABC News that reports that the shooter recently attempted to purchase a gun at a local sporting goods store have not been substantiated at this time.      Adam Lanza used a Bushmaster .223 semi-automatic rifle at close range to kill children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on Friday.      Two handguns were also found at the scene, but law enforcement officials described the Bushmaster as the primary weapon. A fourth weapon was found nearby. The weapons discovered at the school apparently belonged to a family member, possibly his mother, according to authorities.      Lanza, 20, forced his way into Sandy Hook on Friday morning and killed 20 children and six adults before committing suicide. He drove to the school after shooting his mother in the face at their home.      The weapons that police recovered from the scene included a Glock 9-mm handgun, a Sig Sauer 9-mm handgun and a Bushmaster rifle. Police also found .223 shell casings. Lanza was wearing a bullet-proof vest.      The shooter's mother, 52-year-old Nancy Lanza, had five weapons registered to her, including a Glock, a Sig Sauer, and a Bushmaster rifle.      Police said the Glock, the Sig Sauer and the Bushmaster at the school appeared to be registered to a family member. Authorities are currently completing their checks to see which weapons were used in the slayings, to whom they were registered and how they were obtained.      Lanza, who was described by neighbors and former classmates as being very bright, took six classes at Western Connecticut State University in 2008 and 2009, beginning when he was just 16, and had a grade point average of 3.26.      According to Paul Steinmetz, Director of University of Relations at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, Lanza started at the school in the summer of 2008, took a couple classes that fall and then in the spring and summer of 2009.      A 16-year-old attending classes is rare, not unique, Steinmetz said.      He said that some high school students sign up for classes at the college if they are particularly good in some subject. He said the school has probably a few 16-year-olds every semester.      Lanza took courses in computer science, such as website design, the computer language called BASIC, and data modeling, as well as in philosophy, American history and economics.      Steinmetz said he had not heard from anybody on the staff who has any knowledge of Lanza at all, but it would be unusual for a professor to remember a student in a class from four years ago.      He said that in the classes Lanza took there would likely be 20 to 25 students.      Long before Lanza's spree residents of Newtown had noticed that tall, pale boy was different, and believed he had some kind of unspecified personality disorder.      \\"Adam Lanza has been a weird kid since we were five years old,\\" wrote a neighbor and former classmate Timothy Dalton on Twitter. \\"As horrible as this was, I can't say I am surprised.\\"      In school, Lanza carried a black briefcase and spoke little. Every day, he wore a sort of uniform: khakis and a shirt buttoned up to the neck, with pens lined up in his shirt pocket.      A former classmate in his 10th grade honors English class, Olivia DeVivo, says he \\"was always very nervous and socially awkward.\\"      She told ABC News that \\"he didn't really want to be spoken to\\" and that when teachers would call on him \\"it appeared physically difficult for him to speak.\\"      Lanza avoided public attention and had few, if any, friends, though he was a member of the high-school tech club. He liked to sit near the door of the classroom to make a quick exit. ||||| Summary:","output":"A young man named Adam Lanza hurt many people when he went to a school in Connecticut and did a very bad thing. He used a powerful gun and hurt 20 little children and six grown-ups. People who knew him said he was very smart but had some problems.

Mary Watts died in 1938, and was buried alongside George Frederic Watts near the Watts Mortuary Chapel, which she had herself designed and built in Compton in 1901. Following her death, and with both George and Mary Watts increasingly out of fashion, the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52 of the intended 120 spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be a symbol of the Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is what makes it of value in the present day.The nave of Christ Church Greyfriars was destroyed by bombing on 29 December 1940. By then the decline in the population of the City of London had reduced the congregation to less than 80, and the parishes of St Leonard, Foster Lane and Christ Church Greyfriars were merged with nearby St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. Although parts of the ruins were cleared during a widening of King Edward Street after the Second World War, the remains of the nave of Christ Church Greyfriars became a public memorial in 1989; the tower is now office space.St Botolph's Aldersgate remains open as a functioning church.

A major site of ApoD expression in mice is the central nervous system where evidence suggests that it plays a protective role. Gene expression of ApoD was reported in bone-forming osteoblasts but its impact on bone metabolism remains undocumented.', 'We compared basic bone parameters of ApoD(-/-) (null) and transgenic (tg) mice to wild-type (wt) littermates through microCT and histochemistry, as well as ApoD expression and secretion in osteoblasts under various culture conditions through real-time PCR and immunoblotting.', 'ApoD-null females displayed progressive bone loss with aging, resulting in a 50% reduction in trabecular bone volume and a 23% reduction in cortical bone volume by 9months of age. Only cortical bone volume was significantly reduced in ApoD-null males by an average of 24%. Histochemistry indicated significantly higher osteoblast surface and number of osteoclasts in femora from ApoD-null females. ApoD gene expression was confirmed in primary cultures of bone marrow mesenchymal cells (MSC), with higher expression levels in MSC from females compared to males. ApoD-null MSC exhibited impaired proliferation and differentiation potentials. Moreover, exogenous ApoD partially rescued the osteogenic potential of null MSC, which were shown to readily uptake the protein from media. ApoD expression was upregulated under low proliferation conditions, by contact inhibition and osteoblastic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells. Answer: Our results indicate that ApoD influences bone metabolism in mice in a gender-specific manner, potentially through an auto-/paracrine pathway.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: Which designer (brand) created the Kelly bag?","output":"The Kelly bag, an iconic and highly sought-after luxury handbag, was created by the renowned French fashion house Hermès. The brand, founded by Thierry Hermès in 1837, originally specialized in equestrian accessories and later expanded its offerings to include leather goods, silk scarves, and other luxury items. With a strong commitment to craftsmanship and quality materials, Hermès has long been synonymous with elegance, sophistication, and exquisite taste. The Kelly bag's story traces its roots back to 1930 when Robert Dumas, Thierry Hermès's son-in-law, designed a spacious and practical bag technically named \\"Sac à dépêches\\" (translated as \\"Dispatch Bag\\"). It was initially intended as a travel or saddlebag for horse riders. The trapezoidal shape, with a wide base and narrower top, and the use of high-quality leather materials, combined with impeccable craftsmanship, made it an instant hit among the high society. Hermès produced several variations of the bag, such as the Sellier style with exterior stitching and a structured look, and the Retourne style with internal stitching and a softer, slouchier appearance. However, the bag would not receive its iconic name until the 1950s. In 1954, the French actress and fashion icon Grace Kelly was given the purse by the film director Alfred Hitchcock, intended as a wardrobe accessory during the shooting of the film \\"To Catch a Thief.\\" She fell in love with the bag, and it quickly became her favorite accessory. In 1956, shortly after Grace Kelly married Prince Rainier III of Monaco and became the Princess of Monaco, she was photographed using the Sac à dépêches to hide her pregnancy from the paparazzi. The photograph was published in the international press, and the bag became instantly famous, forever associated with the stylish and graceful princess. As a result, it was soon dubbed the \\"Kelly bag.\\" Hermès officially adopted the name \\"Kelly\\" in the 1970s, with the approval of the royal family of Monaco. The Kelly bag remains one of the most iconic and recognizable handbags in the world today, and its popularity has not waned. Currently, it comes in various sizes, leathers, and colors, and each bag is meticulously handmade by skilled artisans in Hermès's ateliers in France. The labor-intensive process, which takes approximately 18 to 24 hours to manufacture a single bag, contributes to the Kelly bag's exclusivity and demand. Moreover, due to the high demand and the long waiting lists, acquiring a Kelly bag can be an arduous task, and the price for a new one easily reaches several thousands of dollars. In conclusion, the renowned French luxury brand Hermès is responsible for creating the iconic Kelly bag. Born as a practical travel bag in the 1930s and later associated with the elegant and graceful Princess Grace Kelly, the exquisite craftsmanship and timeless design of the Kelly bag continue to appeal to fashion enthusiasts and collectors alike. Its unwavering popularity makes it one of the most esteemed and recognizable handbags in the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sometimes I still can't believe the constant quality of Joni Mitchell's discography from the early days in 1968 up until 1980. Mitchell released several masterpieces, not only the well-known Blue and Court & Spark, but also the 'transitional' albums For The Roses annd Hissing Of Summer Lawns can be marked as totally perfect works of art as far as I'm concerned. From there on things got less accesible but actually even more interesting, as Mitchell plunged into the depths of jazz, classical and even African music on Don Juan's Reckless Daughter.     The album takes some time to get used to, but the end-result is a flawed yet fully satisfying album like Blue. Here Mitchell just went through the roof and shamelessly recorded an African drum-and-chant piece (The Tenth World), awkward minimalist-music (the gorgeous Dreamland) and a 16-minute song that packed folk, jazz and classical into one mindblowing piece called Paprika Plains. The other songs continue where Hejira ended, most notably the lovely Jericho and Talk To Me.     The endresult is simply a fantastic record, that many people had problems with upon the original time of release. Too experimental, too weird, too out-there. That may be, but fact is that Don Juan's Reckless Daughter stands as Joni Mitchell's most interesting and boldy innovative work. Ever.","output":"To classify the review as positive or negative, let's analyze the content of the review step by step and look for keywords or phrases indicating the sentiment. 1. The reviewer mentions the \\"constant quality of Joni Mitchell's discography\\" which indicates that they have a positive view of the artist's work in general. 2. They state that several albums are \\"masterpieces\\" and \\"totally perfect works of art\\", which is a strong positive sentiment. 3. The reviewer acknowledges that the album \\"takes some time to get used to\\" and is \\"a flawed yet fully satisfying album\\". This may be seen as a slight negative, but they still find it satisfying which leans positive. 4. The review describes various songs on the album in a positive light using words like \\"gorgeous\\", \\"lovely\\", and \\"mindblowing\\". These demonstrate a clear appreciation for the music. 5. In the conclusion, they call the album \\"a fantastic record\\" and \\"Joni Mitchell's most interesting and boldly innovative work\\". This is a strong positive statement. Justification: Although the reviewer notes that the album may have been seen as \\"too experimental\\" or \\"too weird\\" by some, the overall sentiment in their review is positive as they appreciate the artist's bold approach and enjoy the music. Answer: I would classify this review as \\"POS\\" (positive)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: Ask yourself what each item represents for you. For instance, it could remind you of a special memory or might have been a gift from someone special. Think about why an item is important so you can decide if you’re ready to let it go. As an example, you might have kept old birthday cards that remind you how loved you are. You might also have heirlooms that your grandparents gave you or concert stubs that remind you how much fun you had with your friends. Don’t feel pressured to keep items that are stressing you out or making it hard for you to live the life you want. Ask yourself if each sentimental item you have makes you feel happy or not. Only keep items that bring you joy. For instance, let’s say a loved one gave you a decorative plate they hand painted. You might choose to keep this item because it makes you feel happy. On the other hand, you might let go of a flower bouquet that you caught at a wedding because it’s just gathering dust. Gifts are one of the hardest sentimental items to let go, but that doesn’t mean you have to let gifts clutter up your life. To help you release gifts, remind yourself that your friends and family likely want you to live a happy life. If a gift isn’t serving you, give it away or sell it. Additionally, keep in mind that the person who gave you the gift likely wants it to be used and enjoyed. If you aren’t using a gifted item, give it to someone who will. It may be easier to let items go if you recognize that they aren’t helping you live the life you want. When you’re evaluating an item, consider if you ever use the item or currently display it as a decoration. If it’s not something you use or need, let it go so it’s not becoming clutter. As an example, let’s say you have a stack of drawings that your child made. These can be super hard to get rid of, but it may be easier if you pick 1 to display and let the others go. This way you can remember their drawings every day without having the excess clutter. If you’re a very sentimental person, it might be hard to tell what’s important and what isn’t. Talking to someone who isn’t sentimental may help you get perspective on an item. Ask for help with difficult items if you’re having trouble letting things go.  For instance, you might ask your best friend to help you sort items. If you can’t find someone to come over and help, snap a photo and text it to someone you trust. Ask, “Should I keep this item or let it go? It’s been stored at the back of my closet.” It’s easier to pick out what you do want versus what you want to let go. Focus on identifying the items that you want to keep. Then, donate or give away all of the remaining items. This will help you feel like you’re creating a life that you love rather than letting go of things that are important to you. If you feel obligated to keep something, it's probably best to just let it go. Only keep items you truly want.","output":"To declutter sentimental items, ask yourself what each item represents and if it brings you joy. Consider whether they are important or just gathering dust. Gifts can be challenging to let go of, but remember that the giver likely wants you to be happy and use the gift. If it's not being used, pass it on to someone who will appreciate it. For difficult decisions, consult a less sentimental friend for perspective. Focus on identifying items you want to keep, and donate or give away the rest. Only keep items that have genuine meaning and importance, and let go of items you feel obligated to keep."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities.

Write a title for this article: In February 2011, the British artist Stuart Haygarth set off on a 500-mile journey along England's southern coast. His goal: to pick up every single man-made object that he found along the way. These discarded items – shoes, combs, lighters – are what most of us would call rubbish. But the pieces he made from them, including both installations and carefully composed photographs, turn them into art. Now out in a new book, Strand, these photographs \\"make strange again the mass-produced objects that fill our lives to the degree that we scarcely perceive them\\", Robert Macfarlane writes in the introduction. This excerpt from the book follows Haygarth along the coast through his journal entries. My journey started with a weekend trip in February 2011 to test the water and to get a taste of things to come. I set off from east London in my 1982 VW camper van, which would be my lodgings for the duration of the trip. The walk began in Allhallows-on-Sea on the Hoo Peninsula in Kent, beside the Allhallows Leisure Park, along lines of permanent static caravans and rows of regimented prefabricated wooden cabins. Further along the coast towards Grain, huge industrial factories belched out grey smoke. The landscape turned marshy, with several tributaries leading to the Thames estuary. I was soon to discover, two hours into this first walk, that estuaries are obstacles best to avoid. A trolley modified to hold all the objects that I would collect turned out to be more of a hindrance than a help: its wheels clogged in clay soil, and the many gates I had to climb meant it became unwieldy and cumbersome. On the horizon, I saw a steady stream of gigantic cargo ships pass by on the Thames. The beach begins with shingle and endless rows of groyns installed to prevent longshore drift. There are groups of Sunday dog walkers on the early stretch of coast because there is a safe concrete promenade. At regular intervals, artificial wooden benches are positioned with personal family memorial plaques, several displaying withered bunches of flowers. There are no people beyond the promenade because from here the beach becomes wet and muddy with heavy soil. I discover a couple of shipwrecks resembling the carcasses of beached whales, just the decaying hulls remaining. Rusty vehicle components lie partially buried in the ground. An enormous tractor tyre tipped on its side has become a miniature swimming pool brimming with seawater. On my right-hand side are steep, intimidating clay cliffs showing signs of wet mudslides after weeks of heavy rain. My plywood box is completely full and I struggle like a pit pony through the sticky mud. I decide that a carrying system on my back will be much more efficient than the trolley. Walking at the base of vertical chalky cliffs for most of the day, I had to focus my attention on the tide and exit points. The beaches were deserted because of the overcast day and strong winds. Margate is like a ghost town, symbol of a bygone age of British beach holidays. Boarded-up and decaying buildings with a series of seawater-filled lidos from a different era. The coast walls are covered in chalk graffiti, chunks of chalk littering the promenade. Walking around the belly of the Isle of Thanet, I soon reached Broadstairs with its cute harbour, boats, brightly painted beach huts and an old-style fun fair. The beach defences were coated in a myriad of green hues and textures resembling large canvases of abstract art. I found little of interest to collect but stumbled across a long pink plastic penis wedged in between some rocks on the cliff face. It turned out to be a novelty straw, which made me smile and feel like an archaeologist discovering an ancient drinking implement. The sun had brought families to the beach. Cricket, kite-flying and land yachting were in progress. I noticed a sign warning of an infestation of brown-tail moth caterpillars, and sure enough I could see hundreds from where I was standing. A moat with a lonely chair was left from the previous day’s play. I walked past a flimsy wooden fence laden with pieces of rubbish, carefully positioned to create some kind of totem. The sand changed to wide-open shingle with hardy vegetation growing in scattered clumps. The area around Dungeness is an intriguing and surreal mix: old fishermen’s huts, 1970s retirement homes and newly designed iroko-clad modernist weekend retreats are overlooked by the gigantic and imposing nuclear power station. Beyond here, the coast becomes yet another danger area, a military playground barren apart from abandoned tanks and lookout posts. This area was a treasure trove for flotsam and jetsam. My rucksack was crammed with objects, heavy and cumbersome. I arrived exhausted at Camber Holiday Park and phoned for a taxi to take me back to the camper van. Ten minutes later, I was speeding towards Littlestone with a speed freak lady driver. She moaned about everything – the royal wedding, other drivers, her injured ankle – all except her love of driving. Today was the first rainy day of my walk, so I reluctantly swapped my shorts for a pair of waterproof trousers. Hayling Island does not quite live up to its rather seductive name: amusement arcades, fast-food kiosks and not much else. Even the gale could not deter the many golfers, still going strong. As I walked west along Stokes Bay, the sun came out and my damp clothes began to dry. Southampton Water is a popular sailing area, with small yachts bouncing around on the swell, a stark contrast to the gigantic cruise ships that slowly creep by. I was soon walking through the former Browndown army training camp and nature reserve, which was great for collecting objects. The area had a series of large concrete mushroom structures, no doubt linked to the military in some way. In the distance, I could see the industrial skyline of Southampton and a refinery with smoking chimneys, the smell of oil in the salty air. Tonight there was a full moon over the Solent with views across to the Isle of Wight. I fell asleep to the sound of the wind and the van rocking. At Dawlish, the train tracks hug the Devon coastline, sandwiched in between the sculpted terracotta sandstone cliffs. Today was mainly cliff-top walking, with access to very few beaches. The idyllic coves that I managed to find were clean, so my rucksack remained light. At Teignmouth, I had to circumnavigate the estuary by heading inland to cross over a bridge, adding a couple of miles to my journey. At St Marychurch, I stopped for a short rest. Dog owners threw sticks for their pets, which returned them swiftly, hungry for more play. A small Yorkshire terrier sniffed curiously at my rucksack on the grass and nonchalantly urinated on it before I had a chance to react. The owner apologised, smiled and walked away. The sun was setting as I entered Torbay. I passed rows of luxurious houses with spectacular sea views; tourists were out in force drinking by the harbour. The taxi driver who returned me to the van was a curious-looking character, a tiny man of boyish proportions but with thinning white hair. The film The Curious Tale of Benjamin Button sprang to mind. I had noticed there were many German tourists in Torquay; the driver explained that it was because Fawlty Towers was set and filmed there: they came in search of Basil Fawlty. Constant hard rain and wind. My right boot is letting in water because the seal has broken near the heel, so my foot squelches. There are huge crashing waves, attracting thrill-seeking surfers. Absolutely no one is walking the South West Coast Path today. On a small beach, I found what looked like a decapitated shark with chunks bitten from its torso. I passed the remains of solid stone towers and buildings left from the slate-mining days. Collecting was good, probably due to the recent stormy weather. At Porthcurno, I visited the open-air Minack Theatre, founded by the visionary Rowena Cade, who created a Greek-style amphitheatre on the slope of the cliff face. The light was failing as I reached Land’s End and the skies were dramatic and painterly. Land’s End itself was disappointing. On my arrival, I was confronted with a gigantic car park that was empty apart from two camper vans. In typical vulgar style, there was an array of amusement arcades, gift shops and a cinema showing undersea movies; further along, there was a pub and a charmless modern hotel. I felt melancholy mixed with pleasure at having achieved my goal. Extracted from Strand by Stuart Haygarth, published by Art / Books.

Over the course of several months, Haygarth traveled 500 miles along England's southern coastline with a goal to collect discarded man-made objects along the way. From abandoned shoes to disposable lighters, these previously unnoticed items would become the materials for his transformative artwork. Haygarth's collection of found objects now take on a new life in the form of installations and striking photographs published in his book, Strand. The images evoke a sense of wonder as they bring the viewer face-to-face with the reality of the vast quantity of discarded items we are surrounded by daily. As described by Robert Macfarlane, these photographs \\"make strange again the mass-produced objects that fill our lives to the degree that we scarcely perceive them.\\" The book chronicles his journey through a series of journal entries, providing a glimpse of not only the intricacies entailed in his art but also the challenges he faced along the way. From encountering estuaries and marshlands to exhausting treks through muddy plains and navigating complicated coastal landscapes, Haygarth persevered in his mission to turn discarded trash into art. The artist's musings in the book offer an intriguing look into his creative process, as well as his observations of both the natural beauty and man-made detritus that litter the beaches and cliffs he explored along the way. Strand invites readers to examine the intricate details of each photograph, witnessing first-hand the fascinating transformation of trash into art. Haygarth's work serves as a reminder to look at our surroundings with fresh eyes, urging us to challenge our preconceived notions surrounding the aesthetics of what we might otherwise dismiss as rubbish. As the photographs reveal the overlooked beauty hidden among these discarded items, a deeper appreciation for the potential of reimagining everyday objects emerges. By weaving together a rich tapestry of memories, landscapes, and found items, Strand presents an inspiring reflection on the transformative power of art and the significance of taking the time to examine and reinterpret the seemingly mundane aspects of our lives. In a world where mass-produced items often go unnoticed, Haygarth's journey illuminates the untapped potential of the objects that surround us. As readers embark on this adventure with Haygarth, they will be captivated by the extraordinary beauty captured in both the photographs and the accompanying narratives. The art of transformed rubbish has never been more compelling, and Strand is a testament to the power of creative vision in unearthing the hidden treasures that lie within the ordinary."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Yosemite Sam is the royal chef for a spoiled king (a caricature of Charles Laughton, who frequently played kings and similar heads of state).  On his way back to the castle from grocery shopping, Sam complains that the king never thanks him for his hard work in having to both pick up groceries and prepare meals three times every day, but that the king instead whines that Sam takes too long with preparing the meals, much to Sam's annoyance (\\"Cook!  Cook! Where's my lunch? Where's my dinner?\\"). This drives Sam to the point where he insults the king behind his back. After Sam prepares the king's latest meal, which consists of \\"Cornish Hen a la Westchester\\" and \\"Prime Rib of Mutton au Jus with kreplach Sauce Bordelaise,\\" the king just kicks the dishes away and orders Sam to take it all away.  He then tells Sam he's fed up with having \\"variety\\" at his meals.  Wanting something different for real, the king orders Sam to fix him some hasenpfeffer.  Sam agrees to carry out the king's request, but doesn't know what hasenpfeffer is.  When Sam checks back just to make sure the king said the right word, the king answers the question by throwing a bowl of custard into Sam's face. Angry at this, Sam again insults the king behind his back (\\"OOH! I hate that honorable royal majestic graciousness!\\"). While Sam is looking up the recipe, Bugs Bunny knocks on the door and explains that as he's one of the rabbits residing in the king's royal forest, he's come to borrow a cup of diced carrots.  Sam just slams the door on Bugs and returns to the cookbook, only to discover that hasenpfeffer is a dish that includes a rabbit as one of the ingredients.  Realizing whom he had just shooed away, Sam rushes out after Bugs. Sam manages to trick Bugs into thinking that the king has invited Bugs for dinner. Bugs demurs, saying that he is not prepared; but Sam assures Bugs that he will \\"prepare\\" him.

If you don’t go to class, it is much more difficult to stay current with the material.  Ask questions in class. Your teacher is there to make sure you have a solid grasp on the material. If you have a question, don’t hesitate to ask it. Some of the other students in the class likely have the same question. Prepare for class by reading the lesson you are going to cover ahead of time and know the formulas, theorems, and postulates by heart. Pay attention to your teacher while you are in class. You can talk to your classmates at break or after school. Geometry is the math of shapes and angles. To understand geometry, it is easier to visualize the problem and then draw a diagram. If you're asked about some angles, draw them. Relationships like vertical angles are much easier to see in a diagram; if one isn't provided, draw it yourself.  Understanding the properties of shapes and visualizing them is essential to succeeding in geometry. Practice recognizing shapes in various orientations and based on their geometric properties (the measure of angles, number of parallel and perpendicular lines, etc.). Study groups are a good way to learn the material and clarify concepts you don’t understand. Having a group that meets on a regular schedule will also force you to stay on top of the material and try your best to comprehend it. Studying with classmates is useful when you come to more difficult topics. You can work through them together to figure them out. One of your study mates may understand something that you don’t and help you out with it. You might also be able to help them understand something and learn it better by teaching them. A protractor is a semicircle-shaped tool used to measure the degree of an angle. It can also be used to draw angles. Knowing how to properly use a protractor is an essential skill in geometry. To measure the degree of an angle:  Align the center hole of the protractor over the vertex (center point) of the angle. Rotate the protractor until the baseline is on top of one leg of the angle. Extend the angle up to the arc of the protractor and record the degree it falls upon. This is the measurement of the angle. Homework is assigned because it helps you learn all of the concepts in the material. Doing the homework teaches you what you really understand and what topics you might need to put more time into. If you come across a topic in your homework that you are struggling with, focus on that topic until you understand it. Ask you classmates or your teacher to help you out. When you have a firm understanding of a topic or concept, you should be able to teach it to someone else. If you can’t explain it to them so that they also understand, you likely don’t get it as well as you thought either. Teaching material to others is also a good way to enhance your own memory or recall of the topic.  Try teaching your sibling or parent some geometry. Take the lead in a study group to explain something you know really well. Geometry is as much a skill as a branch of knowledge. Simply studying the rules of geometry will not be enough to get an A, you need to practice solving problems. This means doing your homework and working extra problems for any trouble areas.  Make sure to do as many practice problems as you can from other sources. Similar problems may be worded in a different way that might make more sense to you. The more problems you solve, the easier it will be to solve them in the future. Sometimes going to class and talking to your teacher just isn’t enough. You might need to find a tutor who has more time to focus specifically on what you are struggling with. Working with someone one-on-one can be very useful in understanding difficult material.  Ask your teacher if there are tutors available through the school. Attend any extra tutoring sessions held by your teacher and ask your questions.","output":"This article talks about how to learn and do well in geometry class.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the... The answer to this question is:","output":"Bromeliads nurture frogs, lizards, and various insects.

Start the conversation with a warm hello and tell her your name. Try to avoid using any cheesy pick-up lines. She will probably see right through it and you may come across as disingenuous.  Shake her hand too as a friendly gesture. Not only will she think you’re a real gentleman, touching someone is a subtle way to flirt. If she’s sitting alone or even with a friend, ask if you can hang with them for a bit. Don’t just assume she’s in the mood for company or a chit chat. Your politeness will work in your favor. Keep the subjects light, casual and fun. This should be a lighthearted exchange about very general topics. Consider, for example, asking her where she grew up, what school she attended, what type of music she listens to or where she's traveled to recently. Try to let her do most of the talking so you can really get to know her. If you are still stuck for conversation starters, consider that you clearly like the same types of places so ask if she’s been there before or what her other favorite spots are around town. Let her know that you really like her eyes, her smile or her hair. Keep in mind that you don’t have to compliment a physical attribute. Think about pointing out how great her sense of humor is or how smart she seems to be.  It would be easy to overdo this but don’t. One compliment will do. Keep it short and sweet. Just enough to let her know you find her attractive. This is your first interaction so it’s completely acceptable if it only lasts a few minutes. Don’t feel obligated to camp out for hours on end.   Look for signs to see if she’s interested. Things to look for include: smiling, touching her hair, making direct eye contact, asking follow-up questions or touching your arm.  If she’s not interested, she may have her arms crossed or be giving one word answers. Before leaving, ask if she might be interested in seeing you again. If you’ve been paying attention to her signals, you will know the answer to this question before even asking.  Instead of getting her number, consider giving her yours.

It’s best to do them while lying down when you first get started. Do your exercises daily. You can spread them throughout the day or do them all at once. It’s a good idea to get in the habit of doing them at the same time each day. If you’re having trouble identifying your pelvic muscles, try stopping your stream of urine while using the restroom. When you’ve successfully stopped it, you’ll know that you’re squeezing the right muscles. Squeeze these same muscles during your Kegels. Add 1 second to your squeezes each week until you reach a maximum of 10 seconds. This slowly gets your muscles used to the strengthening exercise, while also challenging them. Don’t push yourself to increase your hold times too quickly. Give your muscles the time they need to gain strength. Choose a provider that has experience in helping women strengthen their pelvic floor. These individuals will be able to evaluate your muscle health and strength. They’ll also be able to show you how to correctly do the exercises. Start by asking your doctor for a referral, as they are your best resource. If they cannot help you find a good trainer or physical therapist, check with local gyms.

Zimbabwe (vote) Translate to Romanian Romanian:","output":"Zimbabwe (vot) În română: Zimbabwe este o țară situată în partea sudică a continentului african, având la nord Zambia, la sud și sud-vest Africa de Sud, la est Mozambic și la vest Botswana. Numit inițial Rhodesia, după colonizatorul britanic Cecil Rhodes, țara și-a schimbat numele în Zimbabwe, la scurt timp după dobândirea independenței în 1980. Numele Zimbabwe vine de la „Dzimba dza mabwe”, care înseamnă „Casele de piatră”, făcând referire la Monumentul Istoric Great Zimbabwe. Cadrul politic din Zimbabwe este organizat sub forma unei democrații parlamentare, cu un președinte care acționează împotriva funcției de șef de stat și șef al guvernului. În prezent, președintele țării este Emmerson Mnangagwa. Parlamentul Zimbabwe este bicameral și se compune din două camere: Senatul și Adunarea Națională. Sistemul electoral din Zimbabwe constă în alegeri periodice, în care cetățenii își pot exercita dreptul la vot pentru a alege membrii celor două camere parlamentare, precum și președintele țării. Legea fundamentală – Constituția Zimbabwe – precizează că toți cetățenii cu vârsta de peste 18 ani au dreptul să voteze. Procesul de vot în Zimbabwe este reglementat și supravegheat de Comisia Electorală din Zimbabwe (ZEC), o instituție independentă responsabilă cu administrarea corectă și transparentă a alegerilor. Aceasta controlează inclusiv înregistrarea alegătorilor, pregătirea urnelor de vot și monitorizarea procesului de numărare a voturilor. În general, mecanismul de vot în Zimbabwe presupune ca alegătorii să meargă la secțiile de votare corespunzătoare circumscripției în care locuiesc, să prezinte documentele de identitate, să primească un buletin de vot, să voteze în mod secret și să depună buletinul de vot în urna corespunzătoare.

Chromosomes contain the genetic information of an organism. Fruit flies reproduce by sexual reproduction. Most of the cells of a fruit fly have 8 chromosomes. Which statement best explains the source of the chromosomes in a normal fertilized fruit fly egg? Choices: (A). The egg cell contains all 8 chromosomes.; (B). The sperm cell contains all 8 chromosomes.; (C). The sperm cell provides 4 chromosomes and the egg cell provides 4 chromosomes.; (D). The egg cell provides 4 chromosomes and 4 sperm cells each provide 1 chromosome.;","output":"To determine which of the given statements explains the source of chromosomes in a normal fertilized fruit fly egg, let's go step-by-step through the process of sexual reproduction and the roles of the egg and sperm cells. Step 1: Understand the role of chromosomes. Chromosomes carry the genetic information of an organism; they are structures found inside the nucleus of a cell and are made up of DNA. Step 2: Recall the process of sexual reproduction in fruit flies. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female reproductive cells (gametes), where the sperm cell (male gamete) fertilizes the egg cell (female gamete) to produce a zygote, which then develops into a new organism. Step 3: Recognize the importance of chromosome numbers in sexual reproduction. To maintain a constant number of chromosomes in successive generations during sexual reproduction, the gametes must have half the number of chromosomes of a somatic (body) cell. Step 4: Consider the chromosome numbers in both the sperm and egg cells of fruit flies. Given that most fruit fly cells have 8 chromosomes, the sperm and egg cells should contain only half the number of chromosomes to ensure that the resulting zygote has the proper amount of chromosomes. Therefore, the sperm cell should have 4 chromosomes, and the egg cell should also have 4 chromosomes. Step 5: Assess the statements and choose the correct one. By examining each statement, we can infer which one best explains the source of chromosomes in the fertilized fruit fly egg: (A) The egg cell contains all 8 chromosomes. - Incorrect, as egg cells should only contain half (4). (B) The sperm cell contains all 8 chromosomes. - Incorrect, as sperm cells should only contain half (4). (C) The sperm cell provides 4 chromosomes and the egg cell provides 4 chromosomes. - Correct, as this option indicates that each gamete contributes half the number of chromosomes (4), ensuring that the resulting zygote has 8 chromosomes. (D) The egg cell provides 4 chromosomes and 4 sperm cells each provide 1 chromosome. - Incorrect, as only one sperm cell is involved in fertilization, not four. Based on the analysis, the statement that best explains the source of chromosomes in a normal fertilized fruit fly egg is: (C) The sperm cell provides 4 chromosomes and the egg cell provides 4 chromosomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since 1987, the band's lineup has consisted of founding members Kevin Shields (vocals, guitar, sampler) and Colm O Ciosoig (drums, sampler), with Bilinda Butcher (vocals, guitar) and Debbie Googe (bass). Their music is best known for its merging of dissonant guitar textures with ethereal melody and unorthodox production techniques, and helped to pioneer the alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Following several unsuccessful early releases and membership changes, My Bloody Valentine signed to Creation Records in 1988. In January 1988, My Bloody Valentine performed in Canterbury, opening for Biff Bang Pow!, a band that featured Creation Records founder Alan McGee. After \\"blowing [Biff Bang Pow!] off the stage\\", My Bloody Valentine were described as \\"the Irish equivalent to Husker Du\\" by McGee, who approached the band after the show and offered them an opportunity to record and release a single on Creation. The band recorded five songs at a studio in Walthamstow, East London in less than a week and in August 1988, released You Made Me Realise. The EP was well received by the independent music press and according to AllMusic's Nitsuh Abebe, the release that \\"made critics stand up and take notice of the brilliant things My Bloody Valentine were up to\\", adding \\"it developed some of the stunning guitar sounds that would become the band's trademark\\". It debuted at number 2 on the UK Indie Chart. Following the success of You Made Me Realise, My Bloody Valentine released their debut full-length studio album, Isn't Anything, in November 1988. Recorded in rural Wales, the album was a major success, receiving widespread critical acclaim, peaking at number 1 on the UK Indie Chart and influencing a number of \\"shoegazing\\" bands, who according to Allmusic, \\"worked off the template My Bloody Valentine established with [the album]\\".  In February 1989, My Bloody Valentine began recording their second studio album at Blackwing Studios in Southwark, London. Creation Records believed that the album could be recorded \\"in five days\\". However, it soon \\"became clear that wasn't going to happen\\". Following several unproductive months, during which Shields assumed main duties on the musical and technical aspects of the sessions, the band relocated to a total of nineteen other studios and hired a number of engineers, including Alan Moulder, Anjali Dutt and Guy Fixsen. Due to the extensive recording time, Shields and Alan McGee agreed to release another EP and subsequently the band released Glider in April 1990. Containing the lead single \\"Soon\\", which featured the first recorded use of Shields' \\"glide guitar\\" technique, the EP peaked at number 2 on the UK Indie Chart and the band toured in summer 1990 to support its release. In February 1991, while still recording their second album, My Bloody Valentine released Tremolo, which was another critical success and topped the UK Indie Chart.  Released in November 1991, Loveless was rumoured to have cost over PS250,000 and bankrupted Creation Records, claims which Shields has denied. Critical reception to Loveless was almost unanimous with praise although the album was not a commercial success. It peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart but failed to chart elsewhere internationally. McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation Records soon after the release of Loveless, due to the album's extensive recording period and interpersonal problems with Shields. When were they signed with Creation Records?","output":"My Bloody Valentine was signed with Creation Records in 1988.

The city straddles South Texas and Central Texas and is on the southwestern corner of an urban megaregion known as the Texas Triangle.  - Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg is an official off campus teaching site of Texas Tech University located in Fredericksburg , Texas . The site was established in 2002 to extend Texas Tech 's presence by hosting year - round academic programs in the Texas Hill Country .  - Enchanted Rock (16710 Ranch Rd 965, Fredericksburg TX) is an enormous pink granite pluton batholith located in the Llano Uplift approximately north of Fredericksburg, Texas and south of Llano, Texas, United States. Enchanted Rock State Natural Area, which includes Enchanted Rock and surrounding land, spans the border between Gillespie County and Llano County, south of the Llano River. Enchanted Rock covers approximately and rises approximately above the surrounding terrain to elevation of above sea level. It is the largest such pink granite monadnock in the United States. Enchanted Rock State Natural Area, a part of the Texas state park system, includes . Designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1936.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Granite is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture. Granites can be predominantly white, pink, or gray in color, depending on their mineralogy. The word \\"granite\\" comes from the Latin \\"granum\\", a grain, in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock. By definition, granite is an igneous rock with at least 20% quartz and up to 65% alkali feldspar by volume.  - Fredericksburg is the seat of Gillespie County, in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2010 Census, the city had a population of 10,530.  - A flash flood is a rapid flooding of geomorphic low-lying areas: washes, rivers, dry lakes and basins. It may be caused by heavy rain associated with a severe thunderstorm, hurricane, tropical storm, or meltwater from ice or snow flowing over ice sheets or snowfields. Flash floods may occur after the collapse of a natural ice or debris dam, or a human structure such as a man-made dam, as occurred before the Johnstown Flood of 1889. Flash floods are distinguished from regular floods by a timescale of less than six hours. The water that is temporarily available is often used by foliage with rapid germination and short growth cycles, and by specially adapted animal life.  - Topsoil is the upper, outermost layer of soil, usually the top to . It has the highest concentration of organic matter and microorganisms and is where most of the Earth's biological soil activity occurs. Four elements constitute the composition of soil. Those elements are mineral particles, organic matter, water, and air. The volume of top soil consists of 50 to 80 percent of these particles which form the skeletal structure of most soils. This composition allows the soil to sustain its own weight, and other internal matter such as water and overlying landscape. Organic matter, another important element, varies on quantity on different soils. This provokes positive and negative effects or reactions on the soil. The strength of soil structure decreases with the presence of organic matter, creating weak bearing capacities. Organic matter condenses and settles in different ways under certain conditions, such as roadbeds and foundations. The skeletal structure becomes affected once the soil is dewatered. The soil's volume substantially decreases. It decomposes and suffers wind erosion.  - South Texas is a region of the U.S. state of Texas that lies roughly south of -- and sometimes including -- San Antonio. The southern and western boundary is the Rio Grande, and to the east it is the Gulf of Mexico. The population of this region is about 4.67 million according to the 2013 census estimates. The southern portion of this region is often referred to as the Rio Grande Valley. The eastern portion along the Gulf of Mexico is also referred to as the Coastal Bend.  - Yucca is a genus of perennial shrubs and trees in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Agavoideae. Its 40-50 species are notable for their rosettes of evergreen, tough, sword-shaped leaves and large terminal panicles of white or whitish flowers. They are native to the hot and dry (arid) parts of the Americas and the Caribbean. Early reports of the species were confused with the cassava (\\"Manihot esculenta\\"). Consequently, Linnaeus mistakenly derived the generic name from the Taíno word for the latter, \\"yuca\\" (spelled with a single \\"c\\"). It is commonly found growing in rural graveyards and when in bloom the cluster of (usually pale) flowers on a thin stalk appear as floating apparitions.  - The Texas Hill Country is a 25-county region of Central Texas and South Texas featuring karst topography and tall rugged hills consisting of thin layers of soil atop limestone or granite. It also includes the Llano Uplift and the second largest granite dome in the United States, Enchanted Rock. The Hill Country reaches into portions of the two major metropolitan areas, especially in San Antonio's northern suburbs and the western half of Travis County, ending southwest of Downtown Austin. The region is the eastern portion of the Edwards Plateau and is bound by the Balcones Fault on the east and the Llano Uplift to the west and north. The terrain is punctuated by a large number of limestone or granite rocks and boulders and a thin layer of topsoil, which makes the region very dry and prone to flash flooding. The Texas Hill Country is also home to several native types of vegetation, such as various yucca, prickly pear cactus, cedar scrub, and the dry Southwestern tree known as the Texas live oak.  - Lubbock is a city in and the county seat of Lubbock County, Texas, United States. The city is located in the northwestern part of the state, a region known historically and geographically as the Llano Estacado and ecologically is part of the southern end of the High Plains.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp?, using the article: The third Chinook carried half of the enhanced A Company group from 1 PARA to Magbeni. The helicopter hovered low above the landing zone that had been identified by the second SAS observation team and the paras jumped from the rear ramp. The observation team had warned that the ground was wet but had been unable to determine the depth of the water, so the paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp. The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and from there to the village, but a small party tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait in the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone.The returning Chinook, carrying the remainder of the A Company group including second-in-command (2IC) Captain Danny Matthews, came under fire from a heavy machine gun in Magbeni, which was promptly strafed by one of the 657 Squadron Lynx helicopters until it ceased firing. The soldiers in Matthews' helicopter exited and joined the first half of the company group on the ground. As the company group moved forward, an explosion—possibly a mortar fired by the British fire support group—injured seven men, including company commander Major Matthew Lowe, one of the platoon commanders, a signaller, and two of Lowe's headquarters staff. Another signaller radioed in a casualty report, and one of the Chinooks en route to Gberi Bana to extract the Royal Irish (who had just been freed by the SAS) landed on the track through the village. The casualties were loaded onto the helicopter, which then picked up the Royal Irish and flew to RFA Sir Percivale where all 13 men were assessed by medics.The operation continued under the leadership of Matthews, the company 2IC, who had taken command almost immediately after the company commander was wounded.

Are they worth it? Meanwhile, the Lakers — and James' former coach — fully expect him to play. ''When you talk about great players like him, those guys even though they're sick or a little injured or whatever, they find a way to perform at a high level,'' Lakers coach Mike Brown, one of James' former coaches with the Cleveland Cavaliers, said Thursday afternoon. ''I don't think it's any different for LeBron.'' James has been battling flu-like symptoms for much of this week. He said it affected him in the early minutes of Miami's game against San Antonio on Tuesday, a contest where he started slowly and still finished with 33 points, 17 of those in a huge third-quarter run as the Heat turned a 14-point halftime deficit into a 22-point win. James said he was feeling better Wednesday, though some symptoms apparently reappeared Wednesday night and into Thursday morning. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra indicated James was sent home only as a precaution. ''He's feeling under the weather still,'' Spoelstra said. Miami will be without guard Dwyane Wade, whose sprained right ankle will keep him sidelined for the second straight game. It's the fifth game Wade will miss in Miami's first 14 this season because of injury, the first three of those caused by a sore left foot. ''The show still goes on,'' Heat forward Chris Bosh said. ''We're still going to expect to win.'' Whether James plays or not, the Heat plan to use Shane Battier and James Jones defensively on Lakers star Kobe Bryant, at least some of the time.

Deila admitted his team are not good enough but must now negotiate a do or die Europa League play-off in a fortnight to salvage any hope of European football this season. Speaking after supporters vented their anger in the direction of club directors at Murrayfield, Deila appealed for time and support to rebuild his squad saying: 'I will need to built up a new team. 'That’s two years in the Champions League for Celtic - but this year we’re not good enough. Not by far. 'That’s our goals as a club and we have to do everything we can to make it a different situation next year when we try and qualify for the Champions League.' Chasing a miracle after a thumping defeat in Warsaw, the game was up for the Scottish champions after the opening goal from Michal Zyro after 35 minutes. A second for Michal Kucharczyk after an hour prompted anger from some Celtic fans in a 30,000 crowd. Doubling up: Michal Kucharczyk scores Legia's second goal past Celtic keeper Fraser Forster. Heading for the play-offs: Kucharczyk celebrates his strike which effectivley killed the tie. Easy street: Legia Warsaw's Michal Kucharczyk (right) is hailed on his goal by fellow scorer Michal Zyro. Concern: Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell (centre) with chairman Ian Bankier and director Eric Riley (right) 'Today we lost to a better team,' added Deila. 'We have to say that over two matches, Legia were better than us. 'I think the players were fighting all they could but we didn’t have the quality to break them down. 'The second goal was poor defending also so we have a lot to work on. 'But also I have to accept that it is our level right now and we have to work from here. I have a big job to do to improve us as a team. 'We can still win the league and get into the Europa League as well this season which would be a very good achievement. 'Then I hope we can stand here next year and talk about happier things than this.' Celtic’s board of directors face a furious inquest into their failure to spend substantial sums on new players, with free transfer keeper Craig Gordon and loan signing Jo Inge Berget the only new arrivals of the summer. Heading through: Legia boss Henning Berg celebrates with his assistant following their shock victory. Nightmare: Celtic's Mikael Lustig picks the ball out of the net following Legia's opening goal. Foot loose: Celtic's Callum McGregor (left) and Legia Warsaw's Tomasz Jodlowiec battle for the ball. Keeper's ball: Celtic's Anthony Stokes (centre) is beaten to the ball by Legia Warsaw's Dusan Kuciak. Goalkeeper Fraser Forster is likely to be the latest departure after handing his jersey to a supporter after Wednesday night’s game. Southampton are now set to submit a fresh £7million bid for the England World Cup star after Celtic lost £15m in Champions League revenues last night. 'I came here to do a job and work with the club,' added Deila. 'I have only been here for six weeks but right now it’s not good enough. That’s what I can see. 'We need to make the squad better by getting new players, which we are working on. 'But also we need to get more from the players here – and there are a lot of skills and a lot of quality.' Asked if Forster has played his final game, Deila was non committal. 'I don’t think so, we will see. 'But things have happened so quickly this last month you never know what’s happening. 'If that is happening we have to deal with that and that’s a position where we have good cover and opportunities.' Glum: Ronny Deila looks on from the touchline in front of his Celtic substitutes pitchside.

Hoping for a comeback: Celtic fans gather before their side's Champions league qualifier at Murrayfield. In full voice: Legia Warsaw supporters were in good spirits as their team went into the clash with a 4-1 lead. Home from home: With Parkhead out of use due to the Commonwealth Games, Murrayfield hosted the qualifier. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"In this story, Celtic, a soccer team from Scotland, lost badly in a big competition called the Champions League.

One of the earliest hits was \\"Big Fun\\" by Inner City. Detroit techno developed as the DJ The Electrifying Mojo did his radio program, which fused eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound. This sound, also influenced by European electronica (Kraftwerk, Art of Noise), Japanese synthpop (Yellow Magic Orchestra), early B-boy (breakdancing) Hip-Hop (Man Parrish, Soul Sonic Force) and Italo disco (Doctor's Cat, Ris, Klein M.B.O.), was further pioneered by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three. Derrick May a.k.a. \\"MAYDAY\\" and Thomas Barnett released \\"Nude Photo\\" in 1987 on May's label \\"Transmat Records\\", which helped start the Detroit techno music scene. This record was played on Chicago's Hot Mix 5 Radio DJ mix show and in Chicago clubs. A year later, Transmat released \\"Strings of Life\\". Transmat Records also released such as 1988's \\"Wiggin\\". As well, Derrick May had releases on Kool Kat Records and many remixes for underground and mainstream recording artists. Kevin Saunderson's company KMS Records contributed many releases that were as much house music as they were techno.

Title: War horse Product review: too much atrocities,death, cruaulties.the 'happy ending' is chidlish.But at least it shos how all animals are mistreated and abused during war,horses,dogs . Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"The review provided depicts the product, in this case the film \\"War Horse,\\" in a predominantly unflattering light, however, it does highlight some positive aspects. The reviewer seems to express dissatisfaction with several elements of the movie, their critique focusing mainly on the depiction of war crimes, death, and cruelty. These aspects have negatively impacted their overall viewing experience, illustrating that they found the portrayal of such brutalities to be too intense or, potentially, unnecessary. Additionally, the reviewer criticizes the conclusion of the film as \\"childish.\\" This could imply that they perceived the ending to be oversimplified or excessively optimistic, considering the harsh realities of war exposed in the rest of the film. This observation can further suggest that the reviewer desired a more realistic, probably even somber, resolution that aligns well with the tone established in the major part of the movie. Despite these criticisms, the review does shed light on a positive aspect of the film as well. The reviewer appreciates the illustration of animal mistreatment during the war. They commend the film's endeavor to depict the sufferings and abuses endured by animals such as horses and dogs. This aspect was evidently significant to the reviewer, and their recognition of it contributes a positive facet to an otherwise harsh critique. In summary, the provided review of \\"War Horse\\" leans more towards an unflattering portrayal of the film. The genuine harshness of war and its impact, the supposedly “childish” conclusion, and the intense depiction of death and cruelty have influenced the reviewer's negative impression. Nevertheless, the acknowledgment of the movie's attempt to shed light on animal abuse during war does provide a slight redeeming factor. Hence, while this review does point out a commendable feature of the film, it chiefly emphasizes the aspects that the reviewer found to be disturbing or lacking, leaning considerably towards an unflattering depiction of the product."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The sentence employs a rather creative and unconventional image, which might render it amusing to some, making it a form of dark humor. However, it is important to pay attention to the context and the target audience, as not everyone may appreciate this kind of humor. The sentence involves a character referred to as \\"the wayward wooden one,\\" which appears to be an anthropomorphism of an object or living being made from wood. The suggestion to \\"end it all\\" implies that the character is facing some kind of existential crisis or hardship that the speaker believes should be ended. The speaker then offers a solution in the form of a vivid and violent action - \\"stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener.\\" This could be interpreted as a cruel or malicious idea, especially if the character is indeed sentient or alive. The sentiment of dark humor comes from the unusual and striking mental image created by the sentence. The idea of a wooden character forcibly inserting itself into a pencil sharpener is unexpected and absurd, adding shock value, which can evoke laughter in certain circumstances. However, because of the dark undertones and a potential lack of empathy towards the character's plight, this could be perceived as insensitive or disturbing, especially to those who are sensitive to self-harm or suicide references. In conclusion, the sentiment of the given sentence can be perceived mainly as dark humor tinged with negativity and potential malice. The appreciation or disapproval of this type of dark humor depends on individual tastes, emotional states, and cultural upbringings, making it vital to evaluate the context in which it is presented and to consider the potential sensitivities of the audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence:","output":"The given data highlights a specific aspect of the demographic information of the United States, focusing on the ethnic group of White Americans. To provide a comprehensive analysis of this data, we will first delve into the context of the United States as a whole, then outline the general concept of ethnic groups, and finally, examine the specific category of White Americans. The United States is a North American country that spans across a vast area, occupying approximately 9.8 million square kilometers of land and has a population of more than 331 million people. The US is known for being a country rich in cultural and ethnic diversity, as people from different backgrounds collectively contribute to its social fabric. This diversity is reflected in the myriad of ethnic groups present in the nation. An ethnic group is a classification of people based on shared ancestry, culture, and other social characteristics. Identifying as part of an ethnic group is often forged in the commonality of language, religion, practices, and traditions. It is essential to note that ethnic categorizations are social constructs that reflect one's sense of identity and belonging, rather than distinct biological or genetic differences. White Americans, in the United States, are a significant ethnic group composed of individuals with European, Middle Eastern, or North African heritage. While recent estimations suggest that approximately 61% of the US population identifies as White Americans, the group’s actual makeup varies widely due to the diverse origins represented under this umbrella term. Some White Americans trace their ancestry back to early European settlers, while others have more recent roots in immigration from European countries, the Middle East, or North Africa. It is also important to mention that many White Americans have mixed ancestry embracing a multiplicity of ethnic and racial identities. The White American group further branches out into numerous subgroups, such as German, Irish, English, Italian, Polish, French, and various other backgrounds, each with its own unique history and cultural heritage in the United States. Throughout American history, societal perceptions, policies, and politics have significantly influenced the dynamics of ethnic groups. White Americans have historically experienced various levels of privilege in comparison to other minority groups in the nation. However, narratives surrounding race and ethnicity continue to evolve with the broadening of awareness, understanding, and appreciation for the United States' multicultural and diverse society. In summary, the data provided emphasizes the ethnic group of White Americans within the broader context of the United States' demographic landscape. This analysis touches on the importance of acknowledging the complexities and nuances of ethnic groups, the diverse make-up of White Americans, and the dynamic nature of societal perspectives on ethnicity in America's ever-changing cultural fabric. By understanding and appreciating such detailed information, we can foster greater inclusivity, empathy, and unity among the different communities inhabiting the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The hairdresser used a comb on her client instead of a brush because the","output":"comb offers better control over the hair strands, allowing precise sectioning and detangling, ultimately achieving a more desired styling outcome. Firstly, a comb offers much finer control when working with hair, especially when it comes to detangling and styling. The teeth of a comb are closer together than that of a brush, which makes it easier to glide through the hair strands with minimal force, reducing the risk of breakage. This is particularly important when working on clients with fragile or damaged hair, as a brush can be too harsh and may cause further damage. Moreover, combs are excellent tools for sectioning hair during various hairstyling processes, such as cutting, coloring or perming. The pointed end of a rat-tail comb, for instance, can help to create clean, sharp partings that are essential for evenly distributing hair products or ensuring the accuracy of a haircut. Brushes, on the other hand, do not have the same level of precision, making it more difficult to achieve professional-looking results. In addition, combs can provide even distribution of various hair products, such as serums, oils, and conditioners, throughout the hair. This ensures that the hair is properly nourished and protected, which will enhance its overall health and appearance. A brush, while suitable for spreading some styling products, might result in uneven distribution and subsequently, less effective results. Combs also come in various types with different-sized teeth, allowing for maximum adaptability to different hair textures and needs. Fine-toothed combs are great for creating smooth, sleek styles on straight hair, while wide-toothed combs are essential for detangling and managing curly or wavy hair. Using the appropriate comb for each hair type will deliver a tailored approach to hairstyling, making it much more efficient and effective. Furthermore, using a comb enables the hairdresser to have a less bulky tool in hand, freeing up their other hand to work with various implements such as scissors, hair clips or hairdryers. This increased dexterity allows for a smoother workflow, leading to enhanced precision and efficiency in their hairstyling techniques. Lastly, combs are excellent in helping to prevent and control static electricity build-up in the hair. Static electricity can cause hair strands to repel each other, making it difficult to manage and style. Combs, particularly those made of materials like carbon or wood, help to dissipate this static electricity, resulting in hair that is more manageable and easier to work with during styling or cutting. In conclusion, the hairdresser used a comb on her client instead of a brush because the comb provides enhanced control over the hair strands, allowing for precise sectioning, styling, and detangling while minimizing hair damage. Combs are indispensable tools for professionals seeking to achieve polished, high-quality outcomes, and are particularly beneficial for adapting to specific hair types and individual client needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Visually a sight for sore eyes, not only for two quite stunning actresses but also for (most of) the costumes and make-up of the actors.

Our Boys Will Shine Tonight is one of my favorites on the album, a good representative of their thick yet intricate guitar work, not to mention excellent drumwork.

Answer the question...when was the last time the san antonio spurs did not make the playoffs??","output":"The last time the San Antonio Spurs did not make the playoffs was in the 2019-2020 NBA season. It was the end of an impressive 22-year playoff streak that began in the 1997-1998 season. This incredible run is attributed to the Spurs' consistency, excellent coaching, and the presence of key players like Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginóbili, who contributed significantly to the team's success over the years. The Spurs' 22-year playoff streak is the longest in NBA history, surpassing the 21-year record previously held by the Philadelphia 76ers (formerly the Syracuse Nationals) from 1950 to 1971. During their streak, the Spurs won 5 NBA championships in the years 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014. In the 2019-2020 season, the Spurs finished the season with a 32-39 win-loss record, which placed them 11th in the Western Conference. They were just short of qualifying for the playoffs in the COVID-19 pandemic-shortened season. The Spurs' inability to make the playoffs was due to a combination of factors, including an aging roster, the rise of competitive teams in the Western Conference, and the absence of significant new talent to replace the retiring big three (Duncan, Parker, and Ginóbili). Despite this setback, the team continues to rebuild and work towards a return to playoff contention in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Coming off their upset win over the New Orleans Saints, the Redskins continued their road trip and traveled to the Edward Jones Dome to meet the St. Louis Rams for a 5th consecutive season, and for the third consecutive season in St. Louis. The Redskins started the game very well with Josh Wilson recovering a Danny Amendola fumble and returning it to the endzone for a 7-0 Redskins lead on the first snap of the game. St. Louis would fight back, however, and pick up a Greg Zuerlein 39-yard field goal to cut the Redskins advantage to 7-3. Washington would close the first quarter with a Robert Griffin III touchdown run to give the Redskins a 14-3 lead going into the second quarter. In the second, St. Louis continued to battle, as Zuerlein hit another field goal. However, on the Redskins' ensuing possession, Griffin III connected with Leonard Hankerson for a 68-yard strike on a play action pass, and the Redskins appeared to take firm control, with a 21-6 edge. However, St. Louis would prove resilient, led by Danny Amendola's 12 receptions in the first half, St. Louis pulled within 8 when Sam Bradford found the aforementioned Amendola to cut the Redskins' advantage to 21-13. Then, just before the half, Griffin threw his first career interception to Cortland Finnegan which set up Zuerlein's 42-yard field goal as the half ended to cut the lead to 21-16. In the third, momentum continued to swing St. Louis' way as Bradford found a wide open Brandon Gibson to give St. Louis its first advantage of the game. Griffin III continued to amaze as he found the endzone for a second time on the ground, and Washington ended the third quarter up 28-23. However, late in the third, for the second straight week, a Saverio Rocca punt was blocked, this time by St. Louis tight end Matthew Mulligan. To open the fourth, Bradford found Mulligan, and rookie Daryl Richardson scampered into the endzone for the two-point conversion, and St. Louis led 31-28. Washington was unable to get into position to tie the game, but had an opportunity late when Richardson fumbled and DeJon Gomes picked it up to give Washington the ball with less than three minutes to play. Washington drove the ball to the St. Louis 29, which would have set up a 46-yard field goal attempt by Billy Cundiff, but Josh Morgan was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct after he threw the ball at Cortland Finnegan, moving Washington back to the St. Louis 46, and making it a 62-yard field goal. Cundiff's attempt was wide right and well short of the distance, and St. Louis held on for the 31-28 win. With the loss, the Redskins fell to 1-1.

Bobby's father Shaw Moore, the Reverend of the Bomont, Georgia church, persuades the city council to pass several draconian laws, including a ban on all unsupervised dancing within the city limits. Three years later, Ren McCormack, a Boston-raised teenager, moves to Bomont to live with his uncle, aunt, and cousins after his mother's death from leukemia and his father's abandonment. Soon after arriving, Ren befriends Willard Hewitt, a fellow senior at Bomont High, and from him learns about the ban on dancing. He soon begins to be attracted to Moore's rebellious daughter - Bobby's sister Ariel - who is dating dirt-track driver Chuck Cranston. After an insult from Chuck, Ren ends up in a game involving buses, and wins despite his inability to drive one. Reverend Moore distrusts Ren and forbids Ariel from ever seeing him again. Ren and his classmates want to do away with the law and have a senior prom. After a while Ariel begins to fall for Ren and dumps Chuck, and he beats her up.

She then reveals that she is no longer a virgin, causing Moore to slap her. Moore's wife, Vi, is supportive of the dancing movement, explaining to Moore he cannot be everyone's father, and that he is hardly being good to Ariel.

Ren goes before the city council and reads several Bible verses given to him by Ariel, that describe how in ancient times people would dance to rejoice, exercise, celebrate, and/or worship.

Rick Treviño, born Ricardo Treviño Jr. on May 16, 1971, in Houston, Texas, is a talented musician who has enjoyed a successful career in the country music industry, contributing to the growing diversity of the genre. A skilled singer, songwriter, and guitarist, Treviño began his career by performing in local venues in Texas. His unique blend of traditional country music with Tejano, Mexican, and Tex-Mex influences caught the attention of Columbia Nashville, and he signed a contract with them in 1993. Throughout the 1990s, Treviño released several albums, including his self-titled debut in 1993, \\"Looking for the Light\\" in 1995, and \\"Learning as You Go\\" in 1996. These albums featured a mix of charting singles, showcasing his distinctive sound and his ability to connect with audiences from different backgrounds and cultures. However, it was \\"Running Out of Reasons to Run,\\" a song from the \\"Learning as You Go\\" album, that secured his enduring place in country music history. \\"Running Out of Reasons to Run\\" was written by George Teren and the late Bob Alan Mummert, a respected songwriter known for his work with several top country artists. The song is a powerful ballad about the confusing and conflicting emotions one experiences while going through a breakup or the end of a relationship.

His achievements have opened doors for other Latino and Mexican American artists in the country music scene who have been inspired by his groundbreaking career.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The given phrase \\"Brána do představivosti\\" is in the Czech language. When translated to English, it reads \\"Gate to imagination\\". The phrase implies a metaphorical entrance or passage leading to a world of creativity, fantasies, ideas, and possibilities that one can conceive in their mind.  The term \\"imagination\\" refers to the capacity to conceive ideas or images that are not present to the senses, which forms the basis for all kinds of creative activity, from art to invention. It is an integral part of human cognition that allows us to visualize hypothetical scenarios, alternatives, or concepts that are yet to be realized.  On the other hand, the term \\"gate\\" traditionally denotes a point of entry into a building, city, territory, or ground. In a philosophical or metaphorical context, the term \\"gate\\" would suggest a link or transition from one state or dimension to another. In this case, from the sphere of the tangible and mundane life to the realm of boundless imagination. Therefore, the phrase \\"Gate to imagination\\" implies an invitation or opportunity to explore one's imaginative capabilities - to open the mind and venture into the endless possibilities that the imagination can offer. It may be applied in various contexts, such as in education, literature, art, philosophy, and psychology, where fostering creativity, originality, and imaginative thinking is often of immense importance.

Goal: machete Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"It appears that you have mentioned the goal as \\"machete\\" but have not provided the list of methods for accomplishing it. However, I will provide a detailed answer by suggesting some methods that can be used for acquiring or using a machete, and I will discuss the reasonableness of each method. Method 1: Purchasing a machete from a store This method involves visiting a physical store that sells outdoor equipment or tools and selecting a machete that suits your needs. This method is reasonable because it allows you to choose from a variety of brands and models, compare prices, and consult with store personnel for suggestions and advice. Additionally, purchasing from a reputable store ensures the product's quality and any warranties or return policies that may come with it. Method 2: Buying a machete online This method involves accessing e-commerce websites, browsing through available machetes, and placing an order for the selected item. This method is also reasonable as online shopping provides convenience and a wider selection of products to choose from. Additionally, users can read reviews from other customers and compare prices from multiple sellers. However, the inability to physically inspect the machete before purchase could be a drawback for some, leading to uncertainty about the product's quality, size, or feel. Method 3: Creating a DIY machete This method involves assembling or modifying an existing tool to create a makeshift machete. While this method could be a fun and potentially resourceful project, it may not be the most reasonable due to safety concerns and the lack of professional manufacturing standards. Homemade machetes might not be as durable, efficient, or reliable as store-bought or professionally manufactured ones. Moreover, the process might require specific skills, tools, and materials, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Method 4: Borrowing or renting a machete This method involves asking a friend, neighbor, or local rental service to lend or rent a machete temporarily. This method can be reasonable if you only need the machete for a short period or cannot justify the cost of purchasing one. However, it might not be the most reliable option, as the availability of the machete depends on the lender's willingness to share it. Additionally, there might be limitations on the time you can use the machete, and potential concerns about damaging or losing the borrowed item. In conclusion, the most reasonable method for acquiring or using a machete depends on factors such as budget, frequency of use, and personal preferences. Purchasing a machete from a store or online is generally the most reasonable method if you plan to use the machete frequently or require a high-quality tool. However, borrowing or renting a machete might be more reasonable for short-term or infrequent use. Creating a DIY machete could be an interesting project, although it may not be the most reasonable method due to safety concerns and potentially unreliable results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPTIONS: (a). around 10,000 years; (b). less than 1000 years; (c). 22 weeks; (d). millions of years; Q: How long can carbon be stored in sedimentary rock?   A: Answer:","output":"Carbon can be stored in sedimentary rocks for millions of years, making option (d) the correct answer. Sedimentary rocks are formed from layers of sediments – consisting of mineral and organic particles – that accumulate over time. These sediments are derived from the weathering and erosion of pre-existing rocks, as well as organic material like dead plants and animal remains. As these sediments accumulate and get buried, the pressure and temperature increase, leading to the process of lithification, wherein the particles are compressed and cemented together, forming sedimentary rocks. Carbon storage in sedimentary rocks primarily occurs when the remains of plants, plankton, and other organisms become trapped within the layers of sediments, entombing carbon within the rock. There is a continuous cycle of carbon exchange between the atmosphere, oceans, and the Earth's crust, known as the carbon cycle. Among different carbon reservoirs, sedimentary rocks are the largest, containing over 99% of the Earth's carbon. Carbon can be sequestered in sedimentary rocks such as limestone, dolomite, shale, and coal, where it can remain trapped for millions of years. For example, limestone and dolomite are formed from the accumulation of calcium carbonate shells of marine organisms, which eventually become compacted and lithified. These carbonate rocks can store large amounts of carbon, with the potential for long-term sequestration. Additionally, the formation of coal results from the burial and compaction of plant material in swampy environments. Over time, heat and pressure cause the plant material to transform into peat, lignite, bituminous coal, or anthracite, depending on the duration and intensity of the metamorphic process. In these cases, carbon is trapped within the organic matter and can be stored for millions of years. Furthermore, shales – which are composed of compacted clay particles – can also lock away carbon, particularly when organic-rich marine sediments are buried. Over time, these shales can be transformed into other sedimentary rocks like slate or schist, further prolonging the sequestration of the carbon. In conclusion, sedimentary rocks play a critical role in the Earth's long-term carbon cycle. By storing carbon for millions of years, they effectively act as major sinks that help regulate the global carbon balance and stabilize the climate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

At various times in its history , the park has been used as a parade ground , a place for mass rallies and a public park . The area of the Lustgarten was originally developed in the 16th century as a kitchen garden attached to the Palace , then the residence of the Elector of Brandenburg , the core of the later Kingdom of Prussia . After the devastation of Germany during the Thirty Years War , Berlin was redeveloped by Friedrich Wilhelm ( the Great Elector ) and his Dutch wife , Luise Henriette of Nassau . It was Luise , with the assistance of a military engineer Johann Mauritz and a landscape gardener Michael Hanff , who , in 1646 , converted the former kitchen garden into a formal garden , with fountains and geometric paths , and gave it its current name . In 1713 , Friedrich Wilhelm I became King of Prussia and set about converting Prussia into a militarised state . He ripped out his grandmother 's garden and converted the Lustgarten into a sand - covered parade ground : Pariser Platz near the Brandenburg Gate and Leipziger Platz were also laid out as parade grounds at this time . In 1790 , Friedrich Wilhelm II allowed the Lustgarten to be turned back into a park , but during French occupation of Berlin in 1806 Napoleon again drilled troops there . In the early 19th century , the enlarged and increasingly wealthy Kingdom of Prussia undertook major redevelopments of central Berlin . A large , new classical building , the Old Museum , was built at the north - western end of the Lustgarten by the leading architect , Karl Friedrich Schinkel , and between 1826 and 1829 the Lustgarten was redesigned by Peter Joseph Lenné , with formal paths dividing the park into six sectors .

We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen. My wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit.

Frank Sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this one. When we first meet Frank in the film's title role, he's the brother of a notorious gunfighter who's out of town at the moment. The brother strikes terror in the heart's of the town and Frank takes full advantage of that to bully the townspeople safe and secure in his shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has any feeling for him. She's the daughter of storekeeper Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. Two other gunmen arrive William Conrad and Christopher Dark and it turns out Conrad has killed Sinatra's brother and he's coming to his town to take over. They humiliate Sinatra and run him out of town. Kirk follows him. Overnight Sinatra turns from punk into coward and becomes a man searching for some kind of backbone. It's a well acted performance, almost as good as his Oscar nominated role in The Man With a Golden Arm. Pity for some reason this has not been seen for years. Two other performances of note are Keenan Wynn as former gunfighter turned preacher who helps Sinatra find what he needs to stand up to Conrad and Dark. And then there is Conrad in what I believe was his career role on screen. He's a villain of incredible malevolence, pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screen. However what I like about Johnny Concho is the climax an unforgettable one where Conrad and Dark are dealt with.

A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

Sentence 1: I was programming just like normal- everything was going fine...everything was going great, actually. Sentence 2: Everything was going great while I was programming. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Yes, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence can be considered true as well because both sentences convey a similar idea. In the first sentence, the speaker expresses that they were programming just like normal and that everything was going fine and even great. The sentence captures the positive experience the speaker had while programming. The second sentence simplifies the idea, focusing solely on the positive aspect, stating that everything was going great during the programming process. This emphasizes the success and enjoyment the speaker experienced while programming. Although the second sentence does not mention the specifics about everything going fine and then progressing to great, the core message remains consistent with the first sentence, and therefore, we can conclude that if the first sentence is true, the second sentence is also true. Both sentences share the essential meaning of the speaker having a positive programming experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mostly known for his geometric perspective - localized paintings in rooms and other spaces , using projector - stencil techniques , according to mathematics professor and art critic Joël Koskas , \`\` A work of Varini is an anti-Mona Lisa . '' Felice paints on architectural and urban spaces , such as buildings , walls and streets . The paintings are characterized by one vantage point from which the viewer can see the complete painting ( usually a simple geometric shape such as circle , square , line ) , while from other view points the viewer will see \`\` broken '' fragmented shapes . Varini argues that the work exists as a whole - with its complete shape as well as the fragments . \`\` My concern , '' he says \`\` is what happens outside the vantage point of view . ''  - Henri-Robert-Marcel Duchamp (28 July 1887  2 October 1968) was a French, naturalized American painter, sculptor, chess player and writer whose work is associated with Cubism, conceptual art and Dada, although he was careful about his use of the term Dada and was not directly associated with Dada groups. Duchamp is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, as one of the three artists who helped to define the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts in the opening decades of the twentieth century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture. Duchamp has had an immense impact on twentieth-century and twenty first-century art. By World War I, he had rejected the work of many of his fellow artists (like Henri Matisse) as \\"retinal\\" art, intended only to please the eye. Instead, Duchamp wanted to put art back in the service of the mind.  - The Mona Lisa (or \\"La Gioconda\\" ) is a half-length portrait of Lisa Gherardini by the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, which has been described as \\"the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world\\".  - Centre Georges Pompidou (commonly shortened to Centre Pompidou; also known as the Pompidou Centre in English) is a complex building in the Beaubourg area of the 4th arrondissement of Paris, near Les Halles, rue Montorgueil and the Marais. It was designed in the style of high-tech architecture by the architectural team of Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano, along with Gianfranco Franchini.  - The Marcel Duchamp Prize (in French : \\"Prix Marcel Duchamp\\") is an annual award given to a young artist by the Association pour la Diffusion Internationale de l'Art Français (ADIAF). The winner receives €35,000 personally and up to €30,000 in order to produce an exhibition of their work in the Modern Art museum (Centre Georges Pompidou).   - The Alpine region of Switzerland, conventionally referred to as the Swiss Alps (, ), represents a major natural feature of the country and is, along with the Swiss Plateau and the Swiss portion of the Jura Mountains, one of its three main physiographic regions. The Swiss Alps extend over both the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps, encompassing an area sometimes called \\"Central Alps\\". While the northern ranges from the Bernese Alps to the Appenzell Alps are entirely in Switzerland, the southern ranges from the Mont Blanc massif to the Bernina massif are shared with other countries such as France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein.  - Locarno (; Ticinese: ; formerly in ) is a southern Swiss town and municipality in the district Locarno (and its capital), located on the northern shore of Lago Maggiore at its northeastern tip in the canton of Ticino at the southern foot of the Swiss Alps. It has a population of about 16,000 (proper), and about 56,000 for the agglomeration of the same name including Ascona besides other municipalities.  - The Italian Renaissance was the earliest manifestation of the general European Renaissance, a period of great cultural change and achievement that began in Italy during the 14th century and lasted until the 16th century, marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe. The term Renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century, in the work of historians such as Jules Michelet and Jacob Burckhardt. Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century, many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century. The French word \\"renaissance\\" (\\"Rinascimento\\" in Italian) means \\"Rebirth\\", and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labeled the Dark Ages.  - Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 14522 May 1519), more commonly Leonardo da Vinci or simply Leonardo, was an Italian polymath whose areas of interest included invention, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography. He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. Sometimes credited with the inventions of the parachute, helicopter and tank, he epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal.

Question: I have a new situation: Bob works for a data storage company. He has now three projects, project A, project B, and project C, simultaneously going on. All of them involves storing  XML data. Project A has small volume of data, but project B and project C has large volume of data. He applied Fast Infoset format for project B, but didn't apply that format for project C.  But I can use this background: Storing large volumes of data – When storing XML to either file or database, the volume of data a system produces can often exceed reasonable limits, with a number of detriments: the access times go up as more data is read, CPU load goes up as XML data takes more power to process, and storage costs go up. By storing XML data in Fast Infoset format, data volume may be reduced by as much as 80 percent.  What is an answer for this question: Which project would register higher CPU load, project A or project C? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's analyze the given information step-by-step: 1. Bob works for a data storage company and has three projects (A, B, C) involving XML data storage. 2. Project A has a small volume of data, but projects B and C have large volumes of data. 3. Fast Infoset format has been applied to project B but not to project C. 4. The background information states that storing large volumes of XML data can lead to increased access times, higher CPU load, and increased storage costs. 5. Using Fast Infoset format can reduce data volume by up to 80 percent, which implies reduced CPU load when processing this format. Now, based on the provided information, let's compare the CPU loads for projects A and C: Project A: This project has a small volume of XML data. Since the volume is small, it will have a relatively lower CPU load for processing the data. Project C: This project has a large volume of XML data and does not use the Fast Infoset format. Therefore, the CPU load for processing this data will be higher due to its larger volume. Answer: Project C would register a higher CPU load compared to Project A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Question: Every Wednesday, I go to Cantata Adult Life Services, a local retirement community in Brookfield, Illinois, US, with my classmates to do community service. After my very first visit to Cantata, my life changed forever. That may sound a bit dramatic, but volunteering with the elderly has changed my views on life. Our visits last about an hour, and we bring 25-30 students every time. We play board games and cards with the residents while we're there. You can watch all the movies and TV shows you want about \\"life back then\\", but nothing compares to talking to the people who were actually there. Just hearing their stories has touched me in a way I never thought possible. Whether it was talking to 98-year-old \\"Hurricane Hilda\\" about her glory days as a roller skater or chatting with Lou about the times she danced with a famous actor, I was completely attracted by every single memory the residents wanted to share with me. Even the residents who don't have amazing memories make the experience satisfying . I remember visiting Mrs Robinson. She couldn't recall much about her past, but she told me she'd never forget how kind I was just to listen to her \\"rambling  \\". It made me realize that it's the little things that make life worth living. That's something I won't forget anytime soon. If there's one thing I've realized in my three years of visiting Cantata, it's that presence - just being there - means more than anything to many of the residents. And despite how busy our lives are, there's always time to make someone's day. For me, it feels great to be a source of happiness, a smile on a bad day or a listening ear for old memories. And at the end of the day, that's all that matters. It's easy to feel like you don't have anything in common with the elderly - especially when you're a teenager. But that's not true at all. I hate to be overly cliched   here, but age really is just a number. As young adults, it's important for us to realize this sooner rather than later. We can learn a lot from the elderly, and they can... What do the volunteers do according to the passage? A) They share everything with the residents. B) They play board games and cards with the residents. C) They watch the residents play games. D) They buy gifts for the residents. Answer:","output":"According to the passage, the volunteers visit Cantata Adult Life Services every Wednesday for community service. This service includes approximately 25-30 students who engage with the elderly residents of the community for about an hour. Their primary activities include playing board games and cards with the residents.

It is not mentioned that the volunteers share everything with the residents, watch them play games, or buy gifts for them. Their main interaction is through friendly games and open conversation where the elderly residents share their past experiences and life stories. This activity has a profound impact on the volunteers, providing them invaluable insights into life from the lived experiences of the elderly and teaching them the importance of presence and empathy in human connections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\\"The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford.

Select from the following.  -- yes;  -- no;","output":"No, the provided statement does not directly answer the question; however, it gives some background information on the nature and history of the szlachta. To address the question, a more detailed answer should be provided. The szlachta were the noble class in the Kingdom of Poland and, later, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. They were neither obscure and mysterious nor entirely obvious and proud as a whole, but rather a diverse and complex group. On one hand, the szlachta were far from obscure; they represented the ruling class in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, consisting of landowners, military leaders, and political representatives. They were proud of their status and actively sought to protect and expand their political and legal privileges. As a class, they clearly displayed their wealth, power, and influence. The traditional attire worn by the szlachta, the kontusz, was one obvious symbol of their proud and distinctive identity. Furthermore, the szlachta were known for their strong commitment to preserving their unique political system, known as the noble democracy. This system gave individual nobles significant political power and resulted in elaborate political debates and negotiations among the members of the class. In various parliamentary debates and disputes, they were anything but hidden from public view. On the other hand, one could argue that aspects of the szlachta's culture and traditions were shrouded in some mystery, particularly for those who were not part of the nobility. The szlachta's origins remain the subject of some historical debate, with theories ranging from descent from Slavic warrior clans to intermarriage between various ethnic groups over time. Furthermore, the szlachta's tradition of Sarmatism - the belief that the noble class descended from the ancient Sarmatian people - added an element of myth and mystique to their self-perceived identity. In summary, the szlachta were a diverse and complex group, with both apparent and perhaps more mysterious elements. While they were certainly a distinct and proud ruling class, their origins, traditions, and motivations were not always transparent to the broader population or completely understood by historians today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: To attach a piece of paper to wood.","output":"To attach a piece of paper to wood, there are several methods and adhesives you can use. It mainly depends on the type of project, available tools, and materials you have. Here is a detailed and long answer that discusses various methods and steps to attach a piece of paper to wood: 1. Choose the right adhesive: Picking the correct adhesive is essential for ensuring the durability and appearance of your project. There are several types of adhesives suitable for attaching paper to wood, and each offers its advantages and disadvantages. Some common adhesive options include: - White glue (PVA glue): This is a versatile, non-toxic adhesive that works well for most paper-to-wood applications. It dries clear and provides a strong bond. - Mod Podge: Mod Podge is a decoupage medium that also acts as a glue, sealer, and finish. It dries clear and is suitable for various applications, including decorative projects. - Spray adhesive: Spray adhesives work well for large surfaces and provide a quick, even application. Ensure you use a suitable spray adhesive that works with paper and wood. Some spray adhesives may bleed through thin paper sheets. - Double-sided tape: This is a simple and quick method for attaching paper to wood. However, it may not be as durable as other adhesive options and may not work well on textured wood. 2. Prepare the wood surface: Before attaching the paper, make sure the wood surface is clean, dry, and free from any dirt, grease, or debris. This will ensure a proper bond and help prevent any peeling or bubbling. For a better bond, you can lightly sand the wood surface with fine-grit sandpaper, especially if it's overly glossy or unfinished. After sanding, wipe the surface clean with a slightly damp cloth and let it dry completely. 3. Prepare the paper: If you're using thin or delicate paper, it's a good idea to apply a layer of adhesive to the back of the paper first. This helps prevent the adhesive from soaking through and causing the paper to wrinkle or tear. Let the first layer of adhesive dry before proceeding. 4. Apply the adhesive: Follow the manufacturer's instructions for applying the chosen adhesive. For white glue, Mod Podge, or similar adhesives, use a foam brush or a paintbrush to apply a thin, even layer to the back of the paper or the wood surface, depending on your preference. For spray adhesive, work in a well-ventilated area and protect the surrounding surfaces with a drop cloth or newspaper. Hold the spray can about 12 inches away from the paper or wood surface and apply an even coat. Wait approximately 30 seconds for the adhesive to become tacky before attaching the paper. If using double-sided tape, apply strips of tape to the back of the paper at the edges and the center. Press the tape firmly to ensure good adhesion. 5. Attach the paper to the wood: Carefully position the paper onto the wood surface, making sure it's properly aligned. Press the paper firmly and evenly onto the wood, starting from the center and working your way outward to remove any air bubbles. A brayer, a plastic card, or a cloth can be used to apply even pressure across the paper surface. 6. Seal the paper (if necessary): If you used Mod Podge or want to protect the paper surface, you could apply a topcoat. Apply a thin, even layer of Mod Podge or a clear acrylic sealer using a clean foam brush or paintbrush. Let the sealer dry completely before handling. 7. Let it dry: Give the adhesive ample time to dry, as suggested by the manufacturer's guidelines. It's essential to allow the adhesive to cure thoroughly before handling or displaying the project to ensure a long-lasting bond. By following these steps and using the appropriate materials, you can successfully attach a piece of paper to wood for a wide range of creative projects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Why is Stampler found not guilty? Movie title: Primal Fear Movie plot: Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a Chicago defense attorney who loves the public spotlight and does everything he can to get his high-profile clients acquitted on legal technicalities. One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a young altar boy from Kentucky with a severe stutter, who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved Archbishop Rushman (Stanley Anderson). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro bono. During his meetings at the county jail with Aaron, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable (Laura Linney). As the murder trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt State's attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a videotape of Stampler being forced to perform in a sexual act with another altar boy and a girl named Linda (Azalea Davila). Vail is now in a bind: Introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, but it would also give his client a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish. When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent sociopath who calls himself \\"Roy\\" who confesses to the murder of the Archbishop and throws Vail against a wall of his jail cell. When this incident is over, Aaron's personality re-emerges and appears to have no recollection of the personality switch. Molly Arrington (Frances McDormand), the psychiatrist examining Aaron, is convinced that he suffers from multiple personality disorder caused by years of abuse at the hands of his father.

The answer is:","output":"Stampler is found not guilty because his defense attorney, Martin Vail, successfully argues that Aaron Stampler suffers from multiple personality disorder. The presence of this mental disorder causes Aaron to have a violent alternate personality named \\"Roy,\\" who confesses to the murder of Archbishop Rushman. By proving that Aaron's personality disorder is a result of years of abuse, Vail is able to persuade the jury that Aaron is not guilty by reason of insanity. This defense strategy leads to Stampler's acquittal, as the jury believes that Aaron was not in control of his actions during the murder due to his mental illness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  Two neighboring towns used different approaches to agriculture. Big town used pesticides and fertilizers, while Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods.  Which town had more fertilizers picked up by rain water? A:","output":"Between the two towns, Big town and Small town, it would be Big town that had more fertilizers picked up by rainwater, given the agricultural practices each town employed. Big town used pesticides and fertilizers in their agricultural methodology. These substances are typically synthetic, and when applied to the field, they tend to remain on the surface of the soil or are absorbed by plants. When it rains, the water droplets combine with these chemicals creating a mixture that can easily be carried away. This process is commonly known as runoff. The more intense a rain event, the more significant the chemical runoff becomes. Therefore, in this scenario, the overuse of such chemicals and subsequent runoff phenomenon would lead to a higher rate of fertilizers picked up by the rainwater in Big town. On the contrary, Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods. Permaculture is a system of agricultural and social design principles that mimic the patterns and relationships found in nature. It results in stable, productive systems that can be used to create communities and landscapes that are resilient, sustainable, and harmonious with the local ecosystem. Organic farming, meanwhile, avoids the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Instead, it relies on natural methods like crop rotation, green manure, compost, and biological pest control. These methods are more mindful of the local ecosystem and result in less contamination of runoff water because they do not involve synthetic chemicals. So, considering these factors, Big town, which employs traditional chemical-heavy farming practices, would have more fertilizers picked up by the rainwater as compared to Small town, which uses permaculture and organic farming principles. This can lead to harmful environmental effects such as algal blooms in nearby water bodies and contamination of groundwater, potentially causing health issues for residents if the polluted water is consumed. Furthermore, this case emphasizes the need for sustainable agricultural practices to safeguard our water resources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

News article: Injured in bombings, a spectator turns runner in 2014 Boston Marathon Updated APR 20, 2014 9:35a ET (FOXSports.com has been chronicling the tales of more than two dozen people affected by the Boston bombings at last year's marathon.This is our next installment. Read their stories.) Last Marathon Monday, Kellie Marshall made the last-minute decision to join her cousins as a spectator at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Marshall, now a senior at Boston University, was one of the hundreds injured by the bombings last year. She was standing on top of a short fence in front of Atlantic Fish Co., one of the restaurants near the finish line, and estimates she was approximately six feet away from the second bomb. Marshall did not see it blow up; she had her head turned toward where the first bomb exploded when the force of the second explosion threw her about eight feet backward into the concrete wall of the restaurant, knocking her out. When Marshall regained consciousness, a table was tipped over onto her leg and she was bleeding from her head. People lay severely injured among pools of blood and severed limbs on the sidewalk in front of her. She could not find her cousins and remembers yelling for them as she tried to comprehend the horrific scene. Marshall’s cousin, Dan, had been standing next to Martin Richard, the 8-year-old boy killed by the blasts, when the bomb went off, and Dan used his shirt as a tourniquet to try to keep Martin alive until his father and first responders could reach him. Meanwhile, someone – Marshall does not know whom -- recognized Marshall was injured and carried her into the restaurant. Marshall suffered a severe concussion, ruptured eardrum and had shrapnel embedded in her right leg as a result of the blast. She was lucky. “If the fence wasn’t in front of me, I think it would have been a lot worse for me because there were so many people who were standing right in front of me who lost limbs,” Marshall said. Since the bombings, Marshall has been one of many who received support from The One Fund for everything from medical bills to healing seminars to techniques to help ease the post-traumatic anxiety many people continue to suffer from daily. In the fall, The One Fund sent out an email offering memorial invitations for anyone interested in running this year’s marathon. Marshall accepted and is planning ahead for Marathon Monday this year, as the 21-year-old is preparing to return to Boylston Street as one of the runners in the 2014 Boston Marathon. Marshall had never run a marathon, but she said she immediately knew it was something she wanted to do. “I’ve always enjoyed running and I think it would be the perfect form of closure for me,” Marshall said. “I’ve always enjoyed running and I think it would be the perfect form of closure for me.” She started training in October, and like any runner, she has to wake up extra early or fit in a run late at night up to five times per week in order to build up the stamina for the 26.2-mile run. As a senior at BU majoring in severe special education and one of the student managers for the school’s men’s hockey team, Marshall also balances a full course-load of college classes and her student-teaching schedule crammed in around hockey practices, games and trips for away games. Then there are the residual effects from her injuries – both physical and mental – that linger to this day. She said she still thinks about everything she saw at the marathon at least two or three times per day, and flashbacks and nightmares continue to keep her up at night. “If something is like a little bit off, I think it’s not normal,” Marshall said. “I’m just very on edge walking around campus or anywhere with a lot of people.” Kellie Marshall (left) is ready to run. Marshall still experiences some symptoms from the concussion she suffered, but nothing has been able to get in the way of her marathon preparation. She credited her family, friends and the BU hockey team as invaluable support systems both in helping her recover and supporting her marathon training. Marshall will need that support as she nears the finish line on April 21. She has been back to Atlantic Fish Co. since the bombings, and she admitted that while returning to Boylston Street as a runner might be difficult, her desire to cross the finish line will make it all worth it. “Just having to picture myself run by around the same time that it happened and everything, that’s just going to be tough,” Marshall said. “But I think crossing the finish line will be like a giant ‘[screw] you.’ It will just show everyone that it shouldn’t keep anyone down. “It happened. It’s over. We can’t be afraid.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The key points of this news article are as follows: 1. In 2013, Kellie Marshall, a Boston University senior, was a spectator at the finish line of the Boston Marathon when the bombings happened. She was injured by the blast, having suffered a severe concussion, ruptured eardrum, and had shrapnel embedded in her leg.  2. During the explosion, Marshall's cousin, Dan, was standing next to 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed in the blasts. Dan used his shirt as a tourniquet trying to keep Martin alive. Meanwhile, an unknown person carried Marshall into a nearby restaurant as she was injured. 3. After recovering from her physical injuries, Marshall dealt with residual psychological effects of the traumatic event, including anxiety, flashbacks, and nightmares. 4. Despite the traumatic experience, Marshall resolved to run in the 2014 Boston Marathon as a form of closure. Her participation in the marathon was supported by the organization, The One Fund, that helps those affected by the bombings. 5. Marshall had never run a marathon before but she immediately knew it was something she wanted to do. She has a busy schedule as a student and manager of the men's hockey team, but managed to train for the marathon five times per week. 6. She credited her family, friends, and the BU hockey team as invaluable support systems in helping her recover and train for the marathon. 7. Marshall acknowledged the emotional difficulty of returning to the scene, especially when nearing the finish line which mirrors her experience during the bombings. However, she was determined to accomplish it, viewing it as a symbol of resilience and unyielding spirit against the terror attack.  In conclusion, the story highlights Kellie Marshall's physical and emotional journey from being a victim of the Boston Marathon bomb blasts to running in it the following year to prove that fear and terror cannot keep people down."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It's the story of the three little pigs and the big bad wolf that blew down a house made of straw and one made of sticks. The only house left standing was the one made of bricks. Now there is new evidence to suggest that houses built with bales of straw can be very strong. They are also very environmental. Pete Walker is a professor at the University of Bath in Britain. He and a team of researchers there have built a house made out of straw bales and hemp material. During the next twelve months the team will study the effectiveness of these materials in home building. Professor Walker says there are many good reasons for using straw. Professor Walker: \\"One of the benefits is it's a relatively inexpensive renewable material that's readily available.\\" He also agrees that straw takes in carbon dioxide as it grows and helps the environment in other ways. So it can be seen as having no harmful effects on the environment. Professor Walker: \\"The straw bale walls are relatively thick and so all that straw provides very good thermal insulation. So we make buildings that require very little heating in the winter or indeed very little cooling in the summer. So they require very little additional energy.\\" Professor Walker says this reduces home operating expenses. It also reduces the effect on the environment. He says the current interest in straw bale houses is a direct response to the problem of climate change. David Lanfear owns an eco-friendly home building service in the United States called Bale on Bale Construction. He says he laughed when some friends first told him about houses built of straw. But after doing his own research, he learned that building with straw bales made a lot of sense.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Dubliners were an Irish folk band founded in Dublin in 1962. The band started off as The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group, named in honour of its founding member; they subsequently renamed themselves as The Dubliners. The group line-up saw many changes over their fifty-year career. However, the group's success was centered on lead singers Luke Kelly and Ronnie Drew. Drew spent some time in Spain in his younger years where he learned to play Flamenco guitar, and he accompanied his songs on a Spanish guitar. Drew left the band in 1974 to spend more time with his family, and was replaced by Jim McCann. He returned to The Dubliners five years later, but left the group again in 1995. Ronnie Drew died at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Dublin on 16 August 2008 after a long illness. Paddy Reilly took Drew's place in 1995. Some of Drew's most significant contributions to the band are the hit single \\"Seven Drunken Nights\\", his rendition of \\"Finnegan's Wake\\", and \\"McAlpine's Fusiliers\\".  Luke Kelly was more of a balladeer than Drew, and he played chords on the five-string banjo. Kelly sang many defining versions of traditional songs like \\"The Black Velvet Band\\", \\"Whiskey in the Jar\\", \\"Home Boys Home\\"; but also Phil Coulter's \\"The Town I Loved So Well\\", Ewan MacColl's \\"Dirty Old Town\\", \\"The Wild Rover\\", and \\"Raglan Road\\", written by the famous Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh. In 1980, Luke Kelly was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Occasionally Kelly was too ill to sing though he was sometimes able to join the band for a few songs. While on tour in Germany he collapsed on stage. When Kelly was too ill to play, he was replaced by Sean Cannon. He continued to tour with the band until two months before his death. Kelly died on 30 January 1984. One of the last concerts in which he took part was recorded and released: Live in Carre, recorded in Amsterdam, Netherlands, released in 1983. In November 2004, the Dublin city council voted unanimously to erect a bronze statue of Luke Kelly. Kelly is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin.  Ciaran Bourke was a singer, but he also played the guitar, tin whistle and harmonica. He sang many songs in Irish (\\"Peggy Lettermore\\", \\"Preab san Ol\\"). In 1974 he collapsed on stage after suffering a brain haemorrhage. A second haemorrhage left him paralysed on his left side. Bourke died in 1988. The band did not officially replace him until his death.  John Sheahan and Bobby Lynch joined the band in 1964. They had been playing during the interval at concerts, and usually stayed on for the second half of the show. When Luke Kelly moved to England in 1964, Lynch was taken on as his temporary replacement. When Kelly returned in 1965, Lynch left the band and Sheahan stayed. According to Sheahan, he was never (and still has not been) ever officially asked to join the band. Sheahan is the only member to have had a musical education. Lynch committed suicide in Dublin in 1982. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"The Dubliners were a famous Irish band that started in 1962, and they had lots of singers over the years.

Nemaja Matic’s red card against Burnley on Saturday comes as a severe blow for Jose Mourinho’s Capital One Cup final plans. The 26-year-old midfielder was sent off for pushing Burnley player forward Ashley Barnes following an awful challenge on the Serbian during the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge. Barnes mistimed his challenge, catching Matic with his studs, but it was missed by referee Martin Atkinson who did not even give a free kick to the title challengers. Ashley Barnes chops down Nemanja Matic during the 1-1 draw between Chelsea and Burnley on Saturday Unsurprisingly Matic sees red and pushed the Burnley player to the ground out of anger on Saturday Having OPTIONS: - Ashley Barnes in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Barnes in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Burnley in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Capital On Cup in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Capital One Cup in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Chelsea in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Jose Mourinho in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Martin Atkinson in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Matic in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Nemaja Matic in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Nemanja Matic in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Serbian in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Stamford Bridge in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Tottenham in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. - Wembley in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game.","output":"The most logical way to complete the passage would be: \\"Nemanja Matic in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game.\\" This makes sense as the passage is about Nemanja Matic's role within the team and how his absence could impact the team's performance. So, the sentence is saying that when Nemanja Matic is playing in the team, they only let in 0.8 goals per game. But without him, they let in two goals per game.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Background: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.  Paragraph: Robert and Justin are both patients in the hospital who are suffering complications from their HIV infections. The doctor is trying to get information from both men about their diseases so he can create customized treatment plans for both men. After a few questions, the doctor discovers that Robert has been infected with HIV for many years, while Justin's infection is quite recent.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will develop infections less frequently? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Justin, who has a more recent HIV infection, will likely develop infections less frequently compared to Robert, who has been infected with HIV for many years. This is because the number of T cells typically declines over time following the initial HIV infection, resulting in a weakened immune system and increased vulnerability to infections. Since Justin's infection is more recent, his immune system is likely to be stronger than Robert's, and therefore, he is less prone to develop infections frequently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? A:","output":"Based on the given review, I would recommend the app with a \\"Maybe\\" response. My reasoning for this answer is as follows: 1. The review mentions that the app is \\"Not accurate... off by 180°,\\" which indicates either a significant error present in the application or a specific instance where the app did not function correctly. This raises a concern about the app's reliability, but it does not necessarily mean the problem occurs all the time or for all users. 2. A single review cannot provide enough information to conclusively judge an app's overall performance. For a detailed understanding of the app's usability and accuracy, it would be ideal to consult multiple reviews from various sources, looking for trends and recurring issues. 3. Despite the negative aspect of the review, we cannot dismiss the fact that it may only represent one user's experience. There might be other users who find the app helpful and dependable. As such, it would be fairer to give the app the benefit of the doubt and offer a \\"Maybe\\" recommendation. 4. Everyone's preferences and requirements for a specific app might differ. What might be deemed unsatisfactory for one user could be tolerable or even desirable for another. Hence, recommending the app with a \\"Maybe\\" allows the potential user to try it for themselves and make their personal judgment.

Use this fact to answer the question: An example of a chemical change is acid breaking down substances A chemical change is likely to happen in which body part?","output":"A chemical change, such as acid breaking down substances, is likely to happen in the human digestive system, particularly in the stomach. The stomach is a key organ in the human digestive system. It is a muscular, sac-like organ situated on the left-hand side of the upper abdomen, just below the ribs. The stomach plays a crucial role in the digestion process by breaking down solid food particles into smaller, partially digested components that the body can easily absorb and use. This process is highly dependent on chemical reactions and changes that are facilitated by various enzymes and gastric acids. One of the essential components of the stomach's digestive function is hydrochloric acid (HCl). The stomach releases this strong acid, along with other digestive enzymes like pepsin, to break down the proteins and other organic compounds found in the food we eat. The chemical reaction between the gastric acids and the food particles leads to various chemical changes in the molecular structure of the food substances, initiating the process of digestion. The hydrochloric acid in the stomach has several functions. First, it helps to kill off any harmful bacteria and pathogens that may be ingested with food, providing a protective barrier against infections. Second, it provides an acidic environment for the activation of the enzyme pepsin, which aids in breaking down the proteins in the food. Third, it helps denature proteins by unwinding their structures and exposing the peptide bonds to enzymatic action. This action results in the breakdown of proteins into smaller units known as polypeptides and amino acids, which are then absorbed in the intestines. The chemical changes that occur within the stomach are not limited to proteins. For example, the acid can help break down carbohydrates, fats, and other essential nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, that must undergo a chemical transformation to enter the bloodstream and be utilized by the body. Once the food is broken down into smaller components, it forms a thick, soupy mixture called chyme, which is then passed from the stomach into the small intestine. In the small intestine, chemical changes continue with the help of enzymes released by the intestines and pancreas, further breaking down the nutrients to be absorbed by the body. In summary, a chemical change like acid breaking down substances is likely to happen in the human digestive system, particularly in the stomach. Hydrochloric acid in the stomach plays a critical role in breaking down the food substances, killing pathogens, and aiding in the digestive process. This chemical change leads to the conversion of complex food particles into small units such as amino acids, simple sugars, and fatty acids, which can then be absorbed and used by the body for energy and other essential functions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Items that can be reused are placed into recycling containers - Recycling trucks pick up the items that are able to be reused - The recyclable items travel to a recycling plant - The items are sorted by what they are made of - The items are broken down into small parts - The small parts are melted to make new raw parts - The raw parts are sold to manufactures to make new items.  Question: suppose materials used are faulty happens, how will it affect more items are broken down.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"If the materials used in the recycling process are faulty, it will most likely result in more items being broken down. To understand this, let's examine the potential consequences of using faulty materials at different stages of the recycling process: 1. Recycling containers: If recycling containers are made from faulty materials, they might be more susceptible to damage or wear and tear. As a result, they may need to be replaced more frequently, leading to more containers being broken down. 2. Recycling trucks: In case the trucks used for collecting recyclables are made of faulty materials, they may also be prone to issues like mechanical failure or breakdowns, causing a disruption in the recycling chain. The need to repair or replace parts of the truck could lead to more materials being broken down. 3. Recycling plant: If machinery and equipment at the recycling plant are manufactured using faulty materials, this could result in inefficient operation or even damage to the recyclable items during the sorting and processing stages. This might require more items to be broken down to meet the demand for raw materials. 4. Sorting and breaking down: Faulty materials in the sorting and breaking down process could lead to errors, such as improperly sorted items or recyclables being damaged during the process. This may result in higher amounts of waste or the need to break down more items to compensate for the losses in material quality. 5. Melting and forming raw parts: If the furnaces or equipment used for melting materials and forming new raw parts are made from faulty materials, it might affect the quality and integrity of the newly-produced raw materials. This could lead to a higher rate of breakdown of these materials, as manufacturers may deem them unfit for creating new products. 6. Selling raw materials to manufacturers: If the faulty materials negatively impact the quality of the raw materials, manufacturers will need to break down more items to obtain enough high-quality material to produce their products. This could lead to a higher demand for recyclable materials to be broken down. In conclusion, using faulty materials in the recycling process is likely to result in more items being broken down due to potential inefficiencies and malfunctions at various stages of the process. This can lead to higher waste and material usage, putting an increased strain on the recycling system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It had been organised by blogger Indigo Rosee, in collaboration with the store. The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They’re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it. I then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop® Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are.

There are two types of digestion: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs when large chunks are turned into smaller chucks. Perhaps not surprisingly, this happens when you chew your food. Once you swallow the food, your stomach also does some of this work. Chemical digestion occurs when food is broken down into useful nutrients. This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food. From the stomach, the foods moves into the small intestine. In the small intestines, another set of chemicals goes to work. Are you surprised? Your small intestine, and not your stomach, does most of the work!

In a world that is continuously evolving and facing numerous challenges, it is essential for initiatives to be developed and implemented that aim to address various issues and improve overall conditions. This particular initiative, which is regarded as being on the right path, signifies that efforts are being made to create positive change. Initiatives that head in the right direction typically possess several key characteristics. Firstly, they are well-researched and based on accurate data and insights. This means they are not only grounded in reality, but they have a strong understanding of the issue they aim to address and the approach required to make a meaningful impact. By being informed, the chances of success increase and the possibility of unforeseen consequences or issues arising is minimized. Secondly, initiatives on the correct path involve collaboration and input from various stakeholders. This is crucial, as it enables the pooling of diverse skills, resources, and perspectives, which ultimately leads to stronger solutions and more effective implementation. Collaboration also fosters a sense of ownership and investment in the initiative, meaning stakeholders are more likely to provide ongoing support and resources necessary for long-term success. Another characteristic of such initiatives is that they are flexible and adaptive. As situations and conditions change, it is important for initiatives to be able to respond and modify their approach as needed. This adaptability ensures that emerging challenges are addressed and that the initiative can remain effective over time. Finally, initiatives heading in the right direction typically have a strong focus on sustainability. This means that they consider the long-term implications of their actions and strive to create solutions that will be impactful and effective in the long run. By addressing root causes and developing strategies that are resilient and future-oriented, these initiatives ensure lasting, positive change. In conclusion, it is encouraging to hear that this particular initiative is on the right path. By ensuring that it possesses the key characteristics mentioned above – being well-researched and informed, collaborative, flexible, and sustainable – it is setting itself up for success in achieving its goals and creating positive change.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I repeatedly see people asking advice on forums as to which is the best detox to do. Whenever I see this question I want to scream at the person 'no, don't do it. It is a waste of your time and money'...but I don't. I don't want to cause a scene, or start a barrage of backlash from people claiming that it worked for them. Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing. Before I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary. Why detoxes don't work Firstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies. I read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \\"shining glory\\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox. Question: How did Veet convince Chinese women that any body hair was unsightly? Answer: Answer:","output":"Veet convinced Chinese women that any body hair was unsightly through a targeted marketing campaign. They equated hair-free skin with health, confidence, and \\"shining glory\\" in their advertisements, creating a perception that body hair was a problem even for those who naturally had very little body hair.

Pick from: + negative + positive","output":"The sentiment of this tweet can be perceived as neutral. This question isn't expressing any form of positive or negative emotions, feelings, or attitudes. It is essentially a subjective query about personal preferences unspecified by the inquirer, hence the sentiment cannot be directly gleaned from it. The task doesn't provide any positive admiration, uplifting, or encouraging sentiments about a specific member of Girls Aloud - which would make it positive. Similarly, it doesn't express any negative, derogatory, or harmful sentiments towards any member of the band either, which means it's not a negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis is thoroughly dependent on the expressed emotions, feelings, or attitudes towards specific subjects or topics. In contexts where no direct emotion, feeling, or attitude is conveyed, such as in this instance, the sentiment is usually categorized as neutral. Despite the fact that attractiveness can carry a positive connotation and the asker's intrigue might be perceived as something positive in general, this does not quantify the sentiment as positive because the question is not directly complimenting, expressing admiration, or stating a positive opinion about any particular member or the band as a whole. It's simply seeking another's opinion regarding attractiveness which could potentially result in either a positive, negative, or neutral response. Therefore, considering all these aspects, the sentiment is most likely neutral due to the lack of explicit emotional expression. However, context may vary in other situations, and a neutral question or statement could have hidden positive or negative sentiments based on nuances and implied meanings in different cultural, social, or personal contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Sofia (or or ;) (\\"Sofiya\\",) is the capital and largest city of Bulgaria. The city has a population of 1.26 million, while 1.68 million people live in its metropolitan area. The city is located at the foot of Vitosha Mountain in the western part of the country, within less than drive from the Serbian border. Its location in the centre of the Balkan peninsula means that it is the midway between the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea, whereas the Aegean Sea is the closest to it.  - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.  - Vitosha, the ancient \\"Scomius\\" or \\"Scombrus\\", is a mountain massif, on the outskirts of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Vitosha is one of the symbols of Sofia and the closest site for hiking, alpinism and skiing. Convenient bus lines and rope ways render the mountain easily accessible. Vitosha has the outlines of an enormous dome. The territory of the mountain includes Vitosha nature park that encompasses the best known and most frequently visited parts. The foothills of Vitosha shelter resort quarters of Sofia; Knyazhevo quarter has mineral springs. Vitosha is the oldest nature park in the Balkans. The mountain emerged as a result of volcanic activity and has been subsequently shaped by the slow folding of the granite rock layers and a series of gradual uplifts of the area. It appears dome shaped at first sight, but the mountain, 19 km long by 17 km wide, actually consists of concentric denudational plateaus rising in tiers one above the other. Vitosha is separated into four main parts whose main ridges gather at a crown known as \\"Cherni Vrah\\" (\\"\\"Black Peak\\"\\"). This is the highest point of the mountain at 2290 m and is one of 10 peaks of Vitosha over 2000 m in height.  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia.

Read this article and answer this question Coming off their shutout home win over the Rams, the Seahawks flew to Candlestick Park for a Week 2 NFC West showdown with the San Francisco 49ers. Seattle would trail early in the first quarter as 49ers kicker Joe Nedney got a 37-yard field goal, along with running back Frank Gore getting a 79-yard touchdown run. The Seahawks would respond in the second quarter as kicker Olindo Mare made a 36-yard field goal. San Francisco would reply with Nedney making a 42-yard field goal. As the Seahawks looked to bounced back from the deficit, quarterback Matt Hasselbeck received an injury as he was hit on the ground by 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis. Hasselbeck would leave the game with cracked ribs, yet Seattle closed out the half with backup Seneca Wallace completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to running back Julius Jones. In the third quarter, the Seahawks deficit quickly increased as on the 49ers' first offensive play of the second half, Gore would explode for an 80-yard touchdown run. San Francisco would close the game out in the fourth quarter as Nedney nailed a 39-yard field goal. How many yards longer was the longest field goal compared to the shortest?","output":"Looking at the article, the shortest field goal was 36 yards by Seattle's kicker Olindo Mare, while the longest was 42 yards by San Francisco's kicker Joe Nedney.

A:","output":"Astronomers use a variety of devices and instruments to observe and study objects at various wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. This enables them to gather valuable information about the universe, celestial objects, and physical processes that occur at different energy levels. Here are some of the key devices and instruments used by astronomers: 1. Optical telescopes: Optical telescopes, which include refracting telescopes (using lenses) and reflecting telescopes (using mirrors), primarily detect visible light. They are used to study objects such as stars, planets, and galaxies by Magnifying and resolving the images. 2. Radio telescopes: These are large, often dish-shaped antennas designed to detect radio waves emitted by celestial objects like pulsars, quasars, and supernovae remnants. Radio telescopes can be used individually or combined into arrays to improve resolution, such as the Very Large Array (VLA) or the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). 3. Infrared telescopes: These telescopes observe infrared radiation emitted by cooler objects in the universe, such as molecular clouds, star-forming regions, and distant galaxies. Infrared observatories can be ground-based, like the Keck Observatory, or space-based, like the Spitzer Space Telescope or the James Webb Space Telescope (launching in 2021). 4. Ultraviolet telescopes: Ultraviolet (UV) telescopes study phenomena such as hot stars, high-energy processes, and the interstellar medium. UV radiation is mostly absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so these telescopes are typically space-based, like the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) or the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX). 5. X-ray telescopes: Astronomers use X-ray telescopes to observe high-energy processes and objects in the universe, such as supernovae, neutron stars, and black holes. X-ray telescopes are space-based because Earth's atmosphere absorbs X-rays. Examples include the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the XMM-Newton observatory. 6. Gamma-Ray telescopes: These telescopes detect the highest energy photons in the electromagnetic spectrum and are useful in studying explosive events like gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and interactions of cosmic rays. Gamma-ray telescopes are also space-based and include instruments like the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the now-retired Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. 7. Spectrographs: Spectrographs are instruments attached to telescopes that disperse incoming light into its constituent colors or wavelengths. They are essential for identifying elements, temperatures, densities, and velocities of celestial objects across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. 8. Photometers: Photometers are used to measure the intensity or brightness of light emitted by celestial objects at specific wavelengths. These devices are vital in determining various properties of stars, like their size and temperature. 9. Interferometers: Interferometry is a technique of combining signals from multiple telescopes to create a single, high-resolution image. It is used across various wavelengths, from radio to optical, to study objects with finer detail. Examples include the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) and the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI). These instruments and devices, combined with advances in technology and computational methods, allow astronomers to study the universe in unprecedented detail and provide valuable insights into the nature and properties of various celestial objects and phenomena."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The name of a monatomic cation is simply the name of the element followed by the word ion. Thus, Na+ is the sodium ion, Al3+ is the aluminum ion, Ca2+ is the calcium ion, and so forth. We have seen that some elements lose different numbers of electrons, producing ions of different charges (Figure 3.3 \\"Predicting Ionic Charges\\"). Iron, for example, can form two cations, each of which, when combined with the same anion, makes a different compound with unique physical and chemical properties. Thus, we need a different name for each iron ion to distinguish Fe2+ from Fe3+. The same issue arises for other ions with more than one possible charge. There are two ways to make this distinction. In the simpler, more modern approach, called the Stock system, an ion’s positive charge is indicated by a roman numeral in parentheses after the element name, followed by the word ion. Thus, Fe2+ is called the iron(II) ion, while Fe3+ is called the iron(III) ion. This system is used only for elements that form more than one common positive ion. We do not call the Na+ ion the sodium(I) ion because (I) is unnecessary. Sodium forms only a 1+ ion, so there is no ambiguity about the name sodium ion. The second system, called the common system, is not conventional but is still prevalent and used in the health sciences. This system recognizes that many metals have two common cations. The common system uses two suffixes (-ic and -ous) that are appended to the stem of the element name. The -ic suffix represents the greater of the two cation charges, and the -ous suffix represents the lower one. In many cases, the stem of the element name comes from the Latin name of the element. Table 3.2 \\"The Common System of Cation Names\\" lists the elements that use the common system, along with their respective cation names. Table 3.2 The Common System of Cation Names.

But how did our bedrooms become so bright?      There are regular warnings that people aren't sleeping properly. Too much light from electronic devices before bedtime. Not enough time in bed. Excessive caffeine. Now there's another potential worry - too much light in the bedroom.      Previous studies have linked light at night with ill health in rodents. Now a study of 113,000 women suggests that it could cause obesity in humans. The work by Oxford University researchers for the Institute of Cancer Research found that women had larger waistlines if their bedroom was \\"light enough to see across\\", the researchers found.      Prof Derk-Jan Dijk, of the Surrey Sleep Centre, said people \\"should assess their bedroom and see how easy it would be to make it darker\\". But have our bedrooms got lighter?      There has probably been a trend towards lighter rooms over the past century, says Alex Goddard, curator at London's Geffrye Museum, which is devoted to the history of the home.      10 tips to beat insomnia Keep regular hours      Create a restful sleeping environment - keep it as quiet and dark as possible, neither too hot nor too cold      Make sure that your bed is comfortable      Exercise regularly      Cut down on stimulants such as caffeine in tea or coffee, especially in the evening      Don't overindulge - too much food or alcohol can interrupt sleep patterns      Don't smoke - smokers often have a more disrupted sleep.

Houses in built-up areas are surrounded by streetlights, car headlights, advertising and other buildings.      The Royal Commission on Light Pollution's 2009 report, Artificial Light in the Environment, warned that in the seven years from 1993 to 2000 significant areas of the UK became more intensively lit at night. The commission noted that outdoor lighting in the UK was growing at an estimated rate of about 3% per annum.      A survey in October 2007 by Harris Poll Europe Omnibus Survey found a third of those interviewed found that light outside bedroom windows led to sleepless nights. The North West of England reported the worst problems with 44% of respondents having difficulties in sleeping because of light pollution.      But as well as the rising amount of light outside our bedrooms, changing home decor trends have exacerbated the problem.      Many people choose lighter curtains and there has been a general move away from curtains to blinds. \\"In the Victorian period it was all the rage to have very heavy, fulsome curtains,\\" Goddard says. \\"People liked really luxuriant fabric. Now they don't as it's hard to clean.\\"      Today light spaces with clean lines are desirable.

Michael Mosley took part in an unusual experiment to see if this is enough. How much can an extra hour's sleep change you? (October 2013)      Guardian interiors editor Ben Spriggs agrees. Blinds have become more popular. And curtains are often thinner. \\"There's been an increase in linens and sheers, which provide privacy but aren't light-blocking at all.\\" A lot of it is down to money - thin is cheap, he says. There's also a move to clearing away the clutter from windows, which is what blinds do.      At the turn of the millennium blinds represented 25% of the domestic window coverings market, according to Andrew Hartley, director of AMA Research, which conducts research into the construction sector. Now that figure is 30%. By contrast, curtains have fallen back from 52-53% to 47%. Much of that change occurred in the early part of the last decade.      Hartley says that although high-specification window coverings - such as plantation-style shutters, blackout curtains and blinds for skylights - have grown over this period, so too have \\"lower-quality\\" goods at the bottom end of the market, fuelled by the rise in the private rented sector.      \\"The middle part of the market has been squeezed,\\" he says. In short, many people decorating a bedroom may be tempted by window coverings that leave the bedroom in a state of half-light rather than true dark.      And inside the rooms there's a fog of light from electronic devices. How many bedrooms are lit by a series of pinpoints from standby lights? Then there's alarm clocks, digital displays and night lights.      Image copyright Thinkstock      The decor has an amplifying effect. Dark walls are out, says Goddard. Light colours and wallpaper are in, which don't dampen the light. Bedrooms often have bigger windows today, whether from warehouse conversions or new build, she argues.      Property developer Sarah Beeny says she can't sleep unless it's dark. While some parents use blackout curtains for young children, it's rare to find them in adults' rooms, she says. People invest in cheap material, she says. \\"It's a great shame people's thinking is short-termist - they think we're going to redecorate in a year or two.\\" Her top priority is a good lining when buying curtains, she says.      But not everyone agrees dark is good. Prof Jim Horne, former head of Loughborough University's Sleep Research Centre, doubts light at night causes obesity. People sleep with their eyes shut and can generally ignore what light there is, he argues. It's lighter in the summer than the winter but there's no evidence that people sleep fewer hours, he adds.      Image copyright Thinkstock      Even if people are waking up when it gets light, most people fall asleep again quickly. \\"The acid test is, are you sleepy during the day?\\" He suspects there may be other reasons for the obesity correlation. \\"One has to look at whether sleeping in the dark is a surrogate for something else. Do people who sleep in light rooms have a fear of the dark? Are they more agitated generally?\\" They could be more susceptible to putting on weight, he believes. More research is needed before people draw any conclusions, he says. \\"The idea that we should all blacken our room is wrong,\\" he says.      An emphasis on absolutely dark bedrooms could even be dangerous. If it's pitch-black then elderly people getting up in the night might have an accident, Horne says.      The evidence is not yet conclusive. But more studies linking light pollution in bedrooms to problems may prompt people to replace those flimsy blinds with thick curtains. And allow sun-streaked bedrooms once again to become places of solemn repose.

A team at the Institute of Cancer Research in London found women had larger waistlines if their bedroom was \\"light enough to see across\\" at night.      However, they caution there is not enough evidence to advise people to buy thicker curtains or turn off lights.      The study of 113,000 women was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology.      The women were asked to rate the amount of light in their bedrooms at night as:      Light enough to read      Light enough to see across the room, but not read      Light enough to see your hand in front of you, but not across the room      Too dark to see your hand or you wear a mask      Their answers were compared to several measures of obesity. Body Mass Index, waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference were all higher in women with lighter rooms.      Prof Anthony Swerdlow, from the Institute of Cancer Research, told the BBC: \\"In this very large group of people there is an association between reported light exposure at night and overweight and obesity.      \\"But there is not sufficient evidence to know if making your room darker would make any difference to your weight.      \\"There might be other explanations for the association, but the findings are intriguing enough to warrant further scientific investigation.\\"      Body Clock      One possible explanation is that the light is disrupting the body clock, which stems from our evolutionary past when we were active when it was light in the day and resting when it was dark at night.      Light alters mood, physical strength and even the way we process food in a 24-hour cycle.      Artificial light is known to disrupt the body clock by delaying the production of the sleep hormone melatonin.      Prof Derk-Jan Dijk, from the Surrey Sleep Centre, said there would be no harm in trying to make bedrooms darker.      He told the BBC: \\"People in general are not aware of the light present in their bedroom, I think people should assess their bedroom and see how easy it would be to make it darker.\\"      Street lights, some alarm clocks and standby lights on electrical equipment such as televisions could light a room, he said.      \\"Overall this study points to the importance of darkness,\\" he concluded.      Cancer      The study was funded by Breakthrough Breast Cancer and the findings emerged from a long-term study to understand the risk factors for breast cancer. Obesity is known to increase the odds of the disease.      Dr Matthew Lam, from the charity, commented: \\"It's too early to suggest that sleeping in the dark will help prevent obesity, a known risk factor for breast cancer, but the association is certainly interesting.      \\"Whilst we are learning more and more each day about the environmental, genetic and lifestyle factors that affect breast cancer risk, it is not yet possible to predict who will get breast cancer, and for women who have been diagnosed with the disease, we can't yet say what caused it.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Researchers warn of the potential health dangers of too much light while we sleep, and how our bedrooms have become brighter over time. Studies have linked light at night with ill health in rodents, and a study of 113,000 women suggests that it could cause obesity in humans. The work by Oxford University researchers found that women had larger waistlines if their bedroom was \\"light enough to see across\\". Prof Derk-Jan Dijk, of the Surrey Sleep Centre, advises people to assess their bedroom and see what they can do to make it darker. The trend towards lighter rooms has most likely increased over the past century, with factors such as more light outside houses, changing home decor trends, and light pollution from electronic devices contributing to brighter bedrooms. Dark walls and heavy curtains are out of fashion, replaced by light colors, wallpaper, and blinds. However, more research is needed before making any conclusions about the effects of light exposure during sleep on obesity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3. Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Q: Question: Do more than a million people live in the city that instituted a law against lap dancing in 2004? Passage 1:The Adult Entertainment Association of Canada (abbreviated AEAC, also called the Adult Association of Canada) is a coalition of strip club owners and their agents that represents 53 of the 140 strip clubs in Ontario, Canada. Tim Lambrinos is the organization's director. The Exotic Dancers' Alliance (EDA), a collective that was founded in 1995 to bring together both former and current strippers and their supporters, sought to establish minimum employment standards for strippers in Ontario by contending with the AEAC, but the EDA ceased to exist in 2004. Also in 2004, Ottawa instituted a law against lap dancing, and the AEAC unsuccessfully attempted to have the law overturned in 2007. Starting in 2004, the AEAC and the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada became embroiled in a long-standing controversy about work permits for foreign workers to be hired for the purpose of striptease. In 2008, when Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Diane Finley allegedly received threats from sex industry officials in relation to her support of Bill C-17, which sought to allow immigration officers to deny temporary visas to prospective strippers if they were suspected to be sex trafficking victims, Lambrinos said that \\"it's not plausible\\" that any of the AEAC strip clubs were responsible for the threats. In 2009, the AEAC invited Toronto City Council members to attend a free lunch at a strip club in the city, and three councillors accepted the invitation. The AEAC released a statement in 2010 that the government's crackdown on sex industry worker visas had resulted in a stripper shortage, and Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews responded by saying that the strip clubs that were short on strippers because of the crackdown were engaging in human trafficking. Toews then ordered the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate the relevant strip clubs in order to determine whether or not the strippers working there were illegal immigrants or sex trafficking victims, and the AEAC launched a campaign to deny these allegations.  Passage 2:Georges Sada was born in 1939 in Iraq into a Christian family of Assyrian ethnicity (see his account). As a boy, Sada attended the Assyrian Church of the East with his family, later becoming a 'born-again' Christian and attending a more evangelical church. Throughout his childhood, Sada had a keen interest in military aircraft and the Air Force, playing as a boy at the RAF Base where his father was stationed, and imagining himself flying the fighters he saw taking off. In this time he did 'odd jobs' at the base, befriending both the pilots and the technicians who repaired their aircraft, resolving that one day he himself would have a career in the Air Force as a pilot. In 1958 at the age of nineteen, Sada applied to the air academy in Iraq and was accepted as a cadet, graduating from the Iraqi Air Academy in 1959. Over the following years he served as an Air Force Officer, including periods studying overseas in Britain, the USSR and the United States. Between 1964–1965 he was a student at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. Sada's career in the air force spanned 28 years, from 1958 to 1986. He officially retired in 1986 as a two-star officer, but was later called back to active service as an Air Vice Marshal for the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. During the conflict Sada defied the orders of Saddam Hussein by refusing to execute POWs, attributing this disobedience to his strong Christian convictions. In interviews, Sada has described his attempts to persuade Saddam not to harm the prisoners (an action which would have violated the Geneva Convention and would have been a war crime): Saddam eventually relented and spared the POWs, although Sada himself was subsequently imprisoned for a time. In his book Saddam's Secrets, Sada states that Saddam did not want him harmed after his release, but wanted no further contact with him thereafter.  Passage 3:Ali was one of several men hired by the United States Army to introduce camels as beasts of burden to transport cargo across the \\"Great American Desert.\\" Eight of the men – including Ali – were of Greek origin. They arrived at the Port of Indianola in Calhoun County, Texas on the . The book Go West Greek George by Steven Dean Pastis, published in both Greek and English, specifically identifies all eight men. These pioneers were Yiorgos Caralambo (later known as Greek George), Hadji Ali (Hi Jolly, a.k.a. Philip Tedro), Mimico Teodora (Mico), Hadjiatis Yannaco (Long Tom), Anastasio Coralli (Short Tom), Michelo Georgios, Yanni Iliato, and Giorgios Costi. The Americans acquired three camels in Tunis, nine in Egypt and 21 in Smyrna: 33 in all. Ali was the lead camel driver during the US Army's experiment with the U.S. Camel Corps in using camels in the dry deserts of the Southwest. After successfully traveling round trip from Texas to California, the experiment failed, partly due to the problem that the Army's burros, horses, and mules feared the large animals, often panicking, and the tensions of the American Civil War led to Congress not approving more funds for the Corps. In 1864, the camels were finally auctioned off in Benicia, California, and Camp Verde, Texas. Ali was discharged from the Quartermaster Department of the U.S. Army at Fort McDowell in 1870.

Another reviewer had it spot-on when he said, \\"the characters are present day Americans dressed up as denizens of the future\\". There are just too, too many references to 19th and 20th century America to be believable. Shotguns, garden hoses...The Wizard of Oz? How would any of these characters know anything about such things?Maybe the Babylon 5 fans like such overwrought pap. I am astonished this won the Hugo award. The number of 5 star reviews here sadden me. Have they never read a decent book before? One in which the author doesn't club you over the head with his \\"wealth of literary knowledge\\"?There was something good here, but it was smothered its own smugness. The answer is:","output":"The given review would most likely decrease the chances of you buying the product. This is because the reviewer highlights several negative aspects and criticisms about the book which can impact your decision to buy the product.  Firstly, the reviewer points out the \\"pretentious smugness\\" of the book, implying that the author's tone may come across as arrogant or self-important. This could potentially put off potential readers who may not enjoy this writing style.  Secondly, the reviewer questions the authenticity of the book's universe and characters, indicating that they seem more like \\"present day Americans dressed up as denizens of the future.\\" This concern about the believability of the story and its elements might make some prospective buyers hesitant to purchase the book. Thirdly, the reviewer criticizes the book for its numerous references to 19th and 20th century America, which detracts from the credibility of the story. They mention specific items like shotguns, garden hoses, and The Wizard of Oz as examples of these seemingly out-of-place references that further weaken the story's plausibility. Additionally, the reviewer expresses their disappointment with the number of 5-star reviews and the Hugo award the book has received, insinuating that these accolades are undeserved. They go on to question the taste of those who have rated the book highly, suggesting that they may not have read a truly great piece of literature. This could create further doubts in potential buyers who might be questioning the book's quality based on this feedback. Lastly, despite acknowledging that \\"there was something good here,\\" the reviewer emphasizes that this aspect was overshadowed by the book's smugness. This statement implies that the promising elements within the book were not enough to compensate for the negative aspects. In summary, this review provides several reasons why the book might not be a satisfying read, thus decreasing the chances of someone purchasing the product based on this feedback. Although individual opinions on literature always differ, the detailed review highlights some aspects that could be off-putting for prospective buyers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Texas Right to Life distributed “hundreds” of “Former Fetus” name plates to anti-abortion legislators ahead of Planned Parenthood’s lobby day at the Capitol Wednesday. The signs displayed outside of offices were removed for violating Capitol rules.      Rep. Jonathan Stickland, R-Bedford, posted a picture of his sign, displayed outside of his office door, on Facebook with a caption reading “organizations that murder children are not welcome in my office.” Shortly after he tweeted that the sign had been removed.      Texas Right to Life spokeswoman Melissa Conway said the group and legislators hoped the signs would “send a very clear message about the humanity of the ‘preborn’ child and that they themselves were a former fetus.”      “We’re very saddened by the thought that there would be anyone that would want to take down the signage, which each legislator feels the need to display,” Conway said.      Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, chair of House Administration Committee tweeted that the signs were removed and returned to the legislators.      Chris Currens, spokesman for the State Preservation Board, said their administrative code states that signs and banners are prohibited from being attached to the Capitol structure and displays are not allowed in the hallways.      “We’ve long held that we need to do that as a building maintenance standard,” Currens said.      Planned Parenthood and supporters rallied at the Capitol and met with legislators Wednesday to speak out against a budgetary recommendation that could cut funding to their clinics for breast and cervical cancer screening.      The Senate included a revised funding mechanism for the state Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening program in their proposed 2016-2017 budget. The new system would prioritize public and government run health centers that provide screenings over private or non-profit clinics that offer “comprehensive primary and preventative care.” Private or non-profit clinics that provide specialized family planning services, like Planned Parenthood, would receive the lowest priority for funding.      Anti-abortion organizations applaud the the change. Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, who heads up the Senate Finance Committee, told The News in January that “public funds should not support abortion providers and their affiliates.”      The combined federal and state-funded program provides free cancer screening and diagnostic tests for women aged 21 to 64 who are uninsured or underinsured and meet low-income requirements. Planned Parenthood saw about 3,300 of the nearly 33,600 women screened through the program in 2014. ||||| See more of Jonathan Stickland on Facebook ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Texas Right to Life, an anti-abortion organization, distributed \\"Former Fetus\\" name plates to anti-abortion legislators prior to Planned Parenthood's lobby day at the Capitol.

As the pressure to solve the murder mounts, beneath the public eye, Chief Thompson and Prosecutor Hampton must grapple with their own deep-seated prejudices. Despite their commitment to justice, they soon realize they unconsciously held biases against the LGBTQ+ community and are forced to confront their internalized homophobia. As they work tirelessly to solve the case and uncover the truth behind Laurel's murder, they begin to question their own beliefs and attitudes. Together, they learn about the challenges that the LGBTQ+ community faces and grow as better friends, leaders, and allies. Parallel to the murder investigation, the story unfolds at personal levels for Chief Thompson and Prosecutor Hampton as they both find out that their very own children, Emily and David, are secretly in love with each other. Both are openly gay and have sought solace in each other's arms amidst the chaos of the world around them. The parents' newfound appreciation of the LGBTQ+ experience reinforces their mission to hold the true perpetrators accountable for Laurel's murder, regardless of the powerful and influential people involved. In the climax of the film, Police Chief Thompson and Prosecutor Hampton use their shared knowledge, skills, and influence to unravel the shocking truth behind the murder case. They uncover a widespread conspiracy involving prominent figures in politics, law, and the entertainment industry who sought to keep their secret involvement with the LGBTQ+ underground hidden from the public spotlight. The film closes with the arrest and successful prosecution of the masterminds behind the murder, sending a powerful message in the city against corruption, social prejudice, and the abuse of power. While justice is served in the end, the film serves as a testament to the evolving nature of society, the importance of empathy in times of darkness, and the relentless pursuit of righteousness. Behind the Blue Line is a gripping and emotionally charged story that showcases the importance of understanding, acceptance, and the power of true friendships amidst turmoil. It is a powerful reminder of our shared responsibility to challenge our prejudices, educate ourselves, and become better allies to marginalized communities."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Movie title: Wonder Boys Context: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon University). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter, is the chairman of the English department and thus Grady's boss. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending - the book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana.His students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Tripp's large house, is attracted to Tripp, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on.During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.Meanwhile, Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.), has flown...

Question: Who asks Charly to marry her? Movie title: Charly Movie plot: Charly Gordon (Cliff Robertson), an intellectually disabled man with a strong desire to make himself smarter, has been attending night school for two years where he has been taught by Alice Kinnian (Claire Bloom) to read and write. However, his spelling remains poor and he is even unable to spell his own name. Alice takes Charly to the \\"Nemur-Straus\\" clinic run by Dr. Richard Nemur and Dr. Anna Straus. Nemur and Straus have been increasing the intelligence of laboratory mice with a new surgical procedure and are looking for a human test subject. As part of a series of tests to ascertain Charly's suitability for the procedure, he is made to race Algernon, one of the laboratory mice. Algernon physically runs through a maze while Charly uses a pencil to trace his way through a diagram of the same maze. Charly is disappointed that he consistently loses the races. Nevertheless, he is given the experimental surgery. After the surgery, Charly is initially angered that he is not immediately smarter than he was before and still loses in races against Algernon. Eventually, however, he beats Algernon in a race and then his intelligence starts increasing rapidly. Alice continues to teach him, but he soon surpasses her. Charly's co-workers also try to tease him by making him work on a machine that they believe he will not be able to work. When Charly shows he can work the machine, his co-workers are not pleased with the fact that he is now intelligent and cannot be teased anymore. They sign a petition against him and he loses his job at the bakery. Charly also starts staring at Alice's bottom and breasts as well as drawing and painting abstract nude figures of her.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To create a air-conditioned fan,","output":"Okay, imagine we want to make a special fan that not only moves air around but also makes the air cooler, like an air-conditioner. Here are two solutions: 1. A fan with a built-in cooling unit: This is like taking a regular fan and attaching a mini air-conditioner to it. The fan will blow air and the mini air-conditioner will cool the air. When they work together, they give you cool and refreshing air. 2. A fan with a water misting system: This is like having a fan that can also spray a super fine mist of water. When the fan blows air, the water mist will evaporate and help cool the air, making it feel better. Both solutions can help achieve the goal of making a fan that blows cooler air. But, the fan with the built-in cooling unit is likely to be more effective at making the air cooler and comfortable than the fan with a water misting system.

Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first.  Which group's cans had the air molecules inside move faster?  Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. The answer to this question is:","output":"Group Jones, the group that did not vent their cans before heating them, experienced the air molecules moving faster inside their cans. As per the kinetic-molecular theory, when a sealed can of soup is heated over a campfire, the air molecules inside the can gain more kinetic energy due to the heat. This increase in energy leads to the air molecules moving faster and colliding with the walls of the can with more force and frequency. The lack of venting in Group Jones' cans meant that there was no release of pressure as the air molecules inside gained more kinetic energy from the heat, causing the pressure to build up significantly within the can. Eventually, the pressure exceeded the strength of the can, resulting in an explosion. Moreover, the boiling of the soup within the can added more gas and pressure, increasing the movement of air molecules further and exacerbating the situation. In contrast, Group George vented their soup cans before heating, which allowed the pressure inside the cans to be released while the cans were heated. This process prevented the pressure from building up to the point of causing an explosion and kept the air molecules from moving as fast and as chaotically as they did in the unvented cans of Group Jones. Thus, Group Jones' cans experienced a faster movement in air molecules due to the combination of increased kinetic energy, pressure build-up, and lack of venting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article in one sentence. The typical household had £26,332 to spend after taxes were paid and benefits received, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Retired households saw a faster rise than others compared with the previous year, owing primarily to income from private pensions. The richest fifth of the population saw a slight fall in their spending power. The average UK household saw their disposable income rise by £564 compared with the previous year, after the rising cost of living - measured by inflation - was taken into account, the ONS said. Senior statistician Claudia Wells said: \\"Household incomes are above their pre-downturn peak overall, but not everyone is better off. \\"While retired households' incomes have soared in recent years, non-retired households still have less money, on average, than before the crash.\\" The median average disposable income of pensioner households has recorded a rise of 13% since 2007-08, compared with a 1.2% fall among non-retired households. The ONS puts growing private pensions ahead of the guaranteed rise in the state pension - under the so-called triple lock - as the long-term reason for the pick-up in pensioners' incomes. However, the £21,770 of typical spending power for retired households remains below the £28,481 of non-retired households. The top fifth of households saw real incomes fall back by £1,000 a year, while the poorest gained £700 on average in 2015-16, the ONS said. Top pay levels have come under pressure, but employment prospects and pay for the poorest have improved, it added. The figures come as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would like to see a maximum cap on the amount people can earn. Household income has tended to pick up faster over the years owing to an increasing number of couples both in employment. Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said: \\"It was another strong year for living standards, particular for poorer households. Strong employment growth, low inflation and rising pensioner incomes over recent years have helped drive inequality down to its lowest level in nearly 30 years. \\"However, the last three years of growth have come back off the back of a living standards squeeze so deep that typical working age families are still £345 poorer than they were before the financial crisis. \\"With employment plateauing, productivity growth refusing to budge and inflation rising, the risk is that this mini boom won't continue.\\" Former chancellor George Osborne tweeted that \\"ONS data today shows inequality fell in 2015/16 & incomes of poorest rose.

A woman wearing a flower t-shirt 2. Makes a transaction at a bike store Hypothesis: 1. A woman buys something at the store Now, let's analyze these components to find the connection between the premise and the hypothesis. The first component in both the premise and the hypothesis refers to a woman. Thus, we can conclude that the 'woman' mentioned in the hypothesis is the same 'woman wearing a flower t-shirt' in the premise. The second component of the premise, \\"makes a transaction at a bike store,\\" provides information about the woman's action during her interaction with the store. In general, a transaction in a store context refers to buying or selling of goods or services, and it often involves the exchange of money. The hypothesis implies that the woman's action is to \\"buy something at the store.\\" Based on the given premise, we know that a transaction has taken place at the bike store involving the woman wearing a flower t-shirt. Therefore, the premise does tell us that a transaction occurred, which potentially confirms the hypothesis of the woman buying something at the store. However, it is important to note that the premise is not very specific about what exactly was bought or sold during the transaction. If the transaction was actually a purchase made by the woman, then the hypothesis would be true. Conversely, if the transaction involved the woman selling something or making a return, the hypothesis would not be fully accurate. To sum up, while the premise does provide some evidence to support the truth of the hypothesis, it does not offer enough information to definitively confirm the hypothesis. More detailed information about the nature of the transaction would be necessary in order to conclusively determine whether the hypothesis is true or not."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the famous artist that decorated the hospital that was opened in 1991?  Founded in 1892, the Carabane school was one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona. Carabane has a new primary school, École François Mendy, inaugurated on January 21, 2006, hosting six classes. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students may continue their studies at the middle school in Elinkine, the Aline Sitoe Diatta High School in Oussouye, and then a university in either Dakar or Ziguinchor. Carabane's kindergarten is located in a community house, called \\"House of Women and Children,\\" founded in 1988 under the auspices of Caritas Ziguinchor. In 1895, the government established a medical post in Carabane, but it closed the following year. In 1898, the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary opened a clinic at the same time as the girls' school.As of 2010, the village has a health facility which is connected to that of Oussouye and Ziguinchor. It provides vaccinations, family planning consultations, and prenatal information.

People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.  - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music.  - Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music.   - The (FIFA ; \\"International Federation of Association Football\\") is the international governing body of association football, futsal, and beach soccer.

The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare.  - Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.  - The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA, ; ) is the administrative body for association football in Europe, although several member states are primarily or entirely located in Asia. It is one of six continental confederations of world football's governing body FIFA.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

Answer:","output":"Fort Lyon, originally known as Fort Wise, is a historical site located in southeastern Colorado, established in 1862 during the American Civil War as a military fortification and supply station. The city closest to Fort Lyon is Las Animas, which is situated just a few miles north of the fort. Regarding the question about the population of Las Animas in the 2010 census, according to the United States Census Bureau, the population of Las Animas, Colorado, in 2010 was 2,410 residents. This number shows the number of people residing in this small city during the specific time period of the 2010 census. It is essential to note that population figures are subject to change over time, and current population estimates might differ from the data gathered back in 2010. Las Animas serves as the county seat of Bent County in Colorado. The city's proximity to Fort Lyon has historical significance for the region. Over the years, Fort Lyon has been utilized for various purposes such as a military enlistment camp, a location for treating homeless veterans, and even a Naval Hospital in the 20th century. Today, Fort Lyon serves as a Supportive Residential Community that provides transitional housing, vocational training, and other support services to individuals experiencing homelessness and substance use disorders. In summary, Fort Lyon, established as a military fort during the Civil War, is located near the city of Las Animas, Colorado. The 2010 census recorded the population of Las Animas as 2,410 residents.

Step 1: Combine like terms on the right side. 597s and -587s are like terms because they both have the variable s. To combine them, we should subtract 587s from 597s. 597s - 587s = 10s So, the equation becomes: 30 = 10s Step 2: Isolate the variable s. To find the value of s, we need to isolate it by getting rid of the coefficient in front of it (which in this case is 10). To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 10. (30) / (10) = (10s) / (10) 30 / 10 = 10s / 10 3 = s So, the value of s is 3.

Answer:","output":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"striking, quietly vulnerable personality\\" can be perceived as positive. The reason for this is the presence of two main adjectives in the sentence: \\"striking\\" and \\"quietly vulnerable.\\"  The first adjective, \\"striking,\\" has a positive connotation, as it implies that the person in question has a strong and impressive personality. This is generally seen as an attractive quality in a person, as it means that they are able to capture attention easily and make a powerful impact on those around them. The second adjective, \\"quietly vulnerable,\\" might seem negative at first glance, as vulnerability is often associated with weakness. However, in this context, it actually adds depth and complexity to the overall sentiment. Vulnerability can be seen as a positive trait because it indicates that the person is open, genuine, and capable of experiencing deep emotions. Moreover, the addition of \\"quietly\\" suggests that this vulnerability is not an excessive or disabling characteristic. Rather, it’s a subtle and nuanced aspect of the individual’s personality, which makes them more relatable and endearing. In summary, the sentiment of this sentence is positive because it describes a person with an impressive, attention-grabbing personality coupled with a genuine emotional depth and openness. This combination of traits is often considered highly attractive and appealing, and thus the overall sentiment is positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Option B is wrong because it talks about shrimp hiding food and doesn't make sense in context of the given paragraph.  Option C is wrong because it describes a wrong method of freezing shrimp.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? too much exploitation  Options: (i) negative (ii) positive","output":"The sentiment of the given sentence \\"too much exploitation\\" is negative. To analyze the sentiment of this sentence, let's first break down the words and their meanings: 1. \\"Too much\\" - This phrase is used to indicate that there is an excess of something. It implies that the amount or degree of a particular thing has crossed a threshold and is now considered undesirable or harmful. 2. \\"Exploitation\\" - This word refers to the act of taking advantage of someone or something, often by treating them unfairly or using their resources for one's benefit without giving anything in return. Exploitation carries negative connotations as it is associated with unfair treatment and harm to those being exploited. Now, let's consider these meanings and their implications in the sentence. By saying \\"too much exploitation,\\" the speaker is implying that there is an excessive amount of unfair treatment or taking advantage of someone or something. This excess of exploitation suggests that it has reached a point where it is harmful or damaging. Since both \\"too much\\" and \\"exploitation\\" carry negative connotations and express undesirable situations, the sentiment of the sentence is more aligned with option (i) negative. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"too much exploitation\\" is negative, as it denotes an excessive and damaging level of unfair treatment or taking advantage of someone or something."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dennis liked pop music, but Jason preferred classical music.","output":"Dennis liked pop music, but Jason preferred classical music because he found that classical music offered a more intricate and layered listening experience. Jason enjoyed the complexities of the compositions, which were deeply rooted in history and brought together the works of brilliant composers like Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who had infused their talents and emotions into their masterpieces. In contrast, Dennis was captivated by the contemporary and catchy allure of pop music. He liked how the melodies were easy to memorize and hum along with, and he enjoyed the upbeat lyrics written by today's famous artists like Taylor Swift, Adele, and Ed Sheeran. For Dennis, the modern sounds of pop music were more relatable to his current lifestyle and the everyday experiences he encountered. While Dennis appreciated the ways that pop music promoted connections between people through shared interests and common themes, Jason found that classical music allowed for a more personal experience. He felt that classical music was a transcendent medium that enabled him to tap into his emotions and convey his deepest thoughts without worrying about adhering to societal norms and trends. One of the main differences between pop and classical music for Jason was the element of timelessness that accompanied classical music. He believed that, unlike pop music, classical works remain relevant and timeless, appreciated by generations and generations of people who find solace, inspiration, and beauty in these intricate creations. This timelessness led him to develop a deeper appreciation for the art and contributed to his preference for classical music. Complete with the harmonies and simultaneous melodies present in classical music, Dennis still enjoyed the vibrant and infectious sound of pop music. He loved how it has evolved over time, from the intriguing tunes of the 80s to the pulsating beats of the contemporary era. He felt that pop music provided a soundtrack to his life and was the perfect companion during a lively Friday night with friends or while driving down a sunny highway. Despite their varying tastes in music, Dennis and Jason both respected each other's preferences. While conversations regarding musical choices often leaned towards healthy debates, they were able to find common ground through their shared love for music as an art form that could evoke different feelings and emotions, and provide an avenue for expression and creativity. This mutual understanding led to a deeper appreciation for the diverse world of music and how it could uniquely affect each listener, making it an invaluable facet of human culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To its west is the Anatolian plateau which rises slowly from the lowland coast of the Aegean Sea and converges with the Armenian Highlands to the east of Cappadocia. To its southeast is the Iranian plateau, where the elevation drops rapidly by about to above sea level. The Caucasus extends to the northeast of the Armenian Highlands. To the southwest of the Armenian Highlands is Upper Mesopotamia.  - Lebanon , officially known as the Lebanese Republic, is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity. At just 10,452 km (4,036 sq. mi.), it is the smallest recognized country on the entire mainland Asian continent.  - The Armenian Catholic Church (\\"Hay Katoik Ekeeci\\") is one of the Eastern particular churches \\"sui iuris\\" of the Catholic Church.

The concept is in limited use, as it significantly overlaps with the Middle East (or Near East), the main difference being the exclusion of Egypt (which would be counted as part of North Africa). The term is sometimes used for the purposes of grouping countries in statistics.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - In Catholic canon law, a particular church is an ecclesiastical community headed by a bishop or someone recognised as the equivalent of a bishop.  - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia.

Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - Clergy are some of the main and important formal leaders within certain religions. The roles and functions of clergy vary in different religious traditions but these usually involve presiding over specific rituals and teaching their religion's doctrines and practices. Some of the terms used for individual clergy are \\"cleric\\", \\"clergyman\\", \\"clergywoman\\", \\"clergyperson\\" and \\"churchman\\".  - In Christian ecclesiology, full communion is a relationship between church organizations, groups, and individuals that mutually recognize their sharing the essential doctrines of Christianity and \\"are able to recognize in one another the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church in its fullness\\". Thus a profession of faith is required of people wishing to enter into full communion with the Catholic Church, even if they have been members of a separate church whose sacraments the Catholic Church considers to be valid. Being \\"in full communion with the Catholic Church\\" is incompatible with denying what it has definitively proposed as its teaching on faith and morals.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Paul Coussa ( 9 September 1917 -- 7 July 2012 ) was a Syrian born Iraqi prelate of the Armenian Catholic Church .

He was a Syrian-born Iraqi prelate of the Armenian Catholic Church. After being ordained a priest in 1941, he was appointed bishop of the Armenian Catholic Diocese of Baghdad, where he served until his retirement in 2001. Aleppo has a rich history, with one of the oldest and continuously inhabited cities in the world. The city's importance grew as it became a significant trading center in the ancient world. As a side note, the complex geopolitical situation in the region, with various countries and cultures interacting with each other, has led to a diverse heritage. The nations mentioned above, such as Turkey, Lebanon, Armenia, and Israel, all have their unique cultural backgrounds, languages, and religions. This diversity is a testament to the historical importance and ongoing relevance of Western Asia in the broader context of the world. Western Asia, also known as Middle East or Southwest Asia, comprises numerous individual countries, many of which share a complex history marked by both cooperation and conflict. It is characterized by a melting pot of various cultures, traditions, languages, and religions. This diverse makeup is the result of millennia of interactions between the different civilizations inhabiting the area, from ancient Mesopotamia to the more recent historical phenomena, such as the spread of Christianity and Islam. The region's position as the crossroads between Europe, Asia, and Africa has infused it with a rich array of cultural influences, from ancient Greeks and Romans to the powerful empires of Persia, the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, and the Ottoman Empire. Moreover, the region's history has also been shaped by the emergence of major religions such as Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Islam, which were both born in and significantly influenced the various societies throughout Western Asia. Today, Western Asia remains one of the most vibrant and diverse regions globally, a hub of culture, religion, and commerce that continues to have a significant impact on the rest of the world. Although political and social challenges persist, the region's extraordinary history and the contributions of its people make it a fascinating and essential component of the broader tapestry of human civilization. In conclusion, situated at the crossroads of three continents, Western Asia has developed a complex intermingling of various cultures and traditions influenced by the historical movements and civilizations passing through the region. This is evident in Aleppo, Syria, where Paul Coussa was born. The nations in this region continue to play essential roles in global culture, commerce, and politics, with their diverse heritages as both distinctions and connections that bind them as a unique yet interconnected collective."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence and a question in the input.

The next morning he introduced himself to the Governor, was received as his guest, and remained in conference with him throughout the day. What was the character of their communication is unknown, except by inference from its results. When presented to Judge Eckels, on the following day, Mr. Kane exhibited to him the letters he bore from the President, and other letters, also, from Brigham Young, accrediting him as a negotiator in the existing difficulties. To General Johnston he showed nothing; nor did the Governor, to the knowledge of the camp, acquaint either that officer or any other person with the purport of his business. It was evident to everybody, however, that the Mormon leaders, conscious of their inability to resist the force by which they would be assailed so soon as the snow should melt upon the mountains, were engaged in an effort, of which Mr. Kane was the agent, to secure through the Governor, if possible, indemnity for their past offences, in consideration of acknowledgment of his authority.

Primark's Twice as Sweet as Sugar Sweeter sugar. Poorer Primark. That's the opposite of what the market has come to expect from Associated British Foods. This time around it was the British conglomerate's sugar division that shone like a silver teaspoon, not its cut-price fashion chain. It made an operating profit of 6 million pounds (8.6 million) in the six months to February 27, reversing a 3 million pound loss last time. The division was helped in the first half by tighter stocks in the global sugar market and lower costs. At last, prices in the European market are starting to rise. Improvement in the sugar division is badly needed. It has seen its profit dissolve from 35 per cent of ABF's total in 2013, to just 4 per cent in the year to September 2015. It's all down to the end of EU sugar sales quotas in September 2017, which has forced producers to fight for big contracts. AB Foods has comfortably out-performed the FTSE 100 over the past year ABF believes sugar has bottomed. It forecasts significantly higher profit for the division next year. In contrast, operating profit at group superstar Primark went backwards, to 313 million pounds in the six months to February 27, from 322 million last time. That's primarily down to sterling's weakness against the dollar. Primark sources almost all its products from suppliers in China and south Asia. It pays in dollars, so the strength of the greenback makes that more expensive. Still, the drop was less than expected because Primark made the most of lower input costs elsewhere, in cotton, oil and freight rates, to offset the dollar strength. Primark sales from stores open at least a year also fell in the first half, although by less than 1 percent. Still, Bernstein analysts estimate this is its first reduction in same-store sales since they started tracking them in 2004. It would be tempting to think we've reached peak Primark, with sugar starting a comeback. But that would be a mistake. True, the outlook for sugar is better than for some time. But Primark, accounting for 42 percent of sales and almost 60 percent of operating profit in the year to September 2015, remains the driver of ABF's fortunes. Sugar has become a much smaller percentage of Associated British Foods' operating profit The U.K. market is tough, but continental Europe and -- most crucially -- the U.S. are performing well. Primark has been well received in the U.S., ABF says, even though Americans don't like its flannel pajamas and U.S. men prefer black and white boxer shorts to other colors and patterns. As Gadfly has argued, while ABF's management has done a pretty good job in steering its disparate collection of businesses, a split between Primark and the food arm would unlock value. Much of the rationale would be to give Primark a higher rating because of its strong potential in the U.S. It trades at a similar level to Zara-owner Inditex when looking at 2018 earnings, but would warrant a stand-alone premium because of those U.S. hopes. The turnaround in sugar lends weight to the break-up argument. ABF's sugar, grocery and agriculture divisions are on a similar multiple to the broader packaged foods industry. With the prospect of a profit rebound in sugar, there's potential to push that higher. All the more reason for ABF to ditch the conglomerate structure.

A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends.

Unfortunately, he did not survive to see the release of the film, as he was found dead on January 22, 2008, in his New York apartment. His housekeeper, Teresa Solomon, discovered him unconscious and unresponsive. The official cause of Heath Ledger's death was determined to be an accidental overdose of prescription medications, which included painkillers, anti-anxiety drugs, and sleeping pills. It was announced that the combination of these substances caused the respiratory failure that led to his untimely demise. Following his death, Ledger was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his exceptional performance as The Joker in \\"The Dark Knight.\\" This role remains one of the most iconic portrayals of a movie villain, and his untimely passing left the film industry and fans mourning the loss of a truly gifted actor."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Step 1: Research the details in the Season 5 of The Vampire Diaries, specifically Elena and Damon's relationship. Step 2: Identify if they indeed break up during the season. After researching, I found that Elena and Damon go through a lot of ups and downs in their relationship during season 5 of The Vampire Diaries. They officially break up in episode 10, \\"Fifty Shades of Grayson,\\" mainly due to Damon's lack of self-worth and fear of losing Elena, despite still loving each other. They share an on-and-off relationship, sometimes giving in to their emotions and getting back together. In the episode \\"While You Were Sleeping,\\" it is evident that their love is strong, and they cannot fight their feelings for each other.

Question: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment.  Two people got stuck in a local  blizzard. Tom had a bottle of alcohol with him and drank it after he found some kind of shelter in the snow. Dan didn't have alcohol with him.  Which of the two people experienced a lower sensation of warmth? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the factors affected by alcohol consumption In this case, the factors are blood vessel dilation and nerve ending stimulation near the skin surface. Step 2: Understand the consequences of each factor Blood vessel dilation and nerve ending stimulation can create a sensation of warmth near the skin surface.

ObamaCare problems making coverage harder to afford, find When Health Republic Insurance of New Jersey announced recently that it’s 46 million in debt and shutting down, it became the 17th failed ObamaCare co-op since the Affordable Care Act launched three years ago. Those failures – just six of the original 23 co-ops remain – have left hundreds of thousands of people scrambling for coverage. Meanwhile, insurers claiming big losses are leaving some state exchanges -- including Indiana University Health Plans, whose exit is expected to result in 27,000 Indiana residents losing ObamaCare plans in 2017. And companies still operating in the federal and state exchanges are raising premiums for next year. Together, the developments are posing new challenges for Americans seeking affordable coverage, and show the highly touted overhaul of the country’s health care system is in some cases not yielding the savings President Obama once promised. As a candidate on the campaign trail in 2008, Obama once said: “If you’ve got health insurance, we’re going to help that employer save 2,500 per family per year. … Those savings are going to be passed along to the workers.” Nationally, though, premium hikes are expected to average 8 percent next year. Many insurance companies are seeking much more than that, for the exchange plans and those offered to employers. Premera in Washington state is approved to charge 19 percent more next year. Rates across California will go up an average of 13 percent. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas is asking to raise premiums a stunning 60 percent. Long-time critics of ObamaCare say they saw it coming. “That basic promise, that it’s going to make health care more affordable, it’s not making health care more affordable,” said Avik Roy, an author and Republican adviser. “It’s making health care more expensive, especially for the uninsured.” The problem remains a risk pool with too many sick people and not enough who are young and healthy. Also, federal backstop programs, aimed at helping companies that miscalculated how much to charge, are now expired. So insurance companies need higher premiums to cover payouts to doctors and hospitals. The alternative is pulling out of health exchanges, which many companies have been doing. In recent months Aetna, United Health Care and several Blue Cross and Blue Shield subsidiaries have announced they will be leaving many of the exchanges in 2017. “That’s going to be the future,” said Roger Stark of the Washington Policy Center in Washington State. “What we’re seeing here is the beginning of a death spiral as far as exchanges are concerned as more companies pull out.” In Indiana, the company pulling out of the exchange had covered 15 percent of those covered under ObamaCare. Indiana Sen. Dan Coats, a Republican, told The Washington Times this is further evidence the health care law is “collapsing before our eyes.” The Obama administration says its signature legislation can boast plenty of successes. Twenty-million additional people are insured, whether through the exchanges, through expanded Medicaid or young adults who are able to stay on their parents’ policies. Also, the growth in health care spending nationally has slowed. As for rising premiums, many Democrats including presidential nominee Hillary Clinton favor offering a government public option that would compete directly with for-profit insurance companies. “If a public option could bring premiums down, primarily by paying doctors and hospitals less and having lower overhead and no profit, that would lower federal government costs,” said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump opposes a public option. Trump has called for scrapping ObamaCare and starting over. He favors more competition by allowing people to buy health insurance across state lines. Dan Springer joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in August 2001 as a Seattle-based correspondent. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"ObamaCare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, was created to help people in the United States get health insurance, but some issues have made it harder for people to find and afford the coverage they need.

As his son Yegor has now become a Dark Other, Anton is forced to secretly destroy evidence of Yegor's attacks on normal people, which violates the treaty, leaving the Night Watch unable to sentence Yegor. To redeem for his previous mistake, an attempt to use a witch's service to kill the unborn Yegor (shown in the beginning of the first film), Anton seeks the legendary Chalk of Fate, a magical chalk that could rewrite history, which was once Tamerlane's property and one of the main reasons for his numerous military successes. Meanwhile, Zavulon, the leader of the Dark Others and their Day Watch, is waiting for Yegor's birthday. At the birthday, Yegor would become a Great Other and acquire the power that would allow the Dark Others to break the treaty (which is only supported because the Others fear that the two sides will destroy each other). Zavulon's gratitude to Anton for covering Yegor's violations of the treaty doesn't stop him and the Day Watch from attempting to frame Anton for murder and bring him in front of the Inquisition. They succeed, despite the efforts made by Gesser, the head of the Night Watch, to protect Anton from the Dark Others by putting him in Olga's body. While in her body, Svetlana confesses that she loves Anton to the person she thinks is Olga, which pushes their relationship forward. This happens despite Svetlana's initial anger at Anton for not telling her that he was in Olga's body. Anton obtains the Chalk of Fate from its hiding place in a Central Asian cafe in Moscow and uses it to summon Yegor. They initially get on well, but Yegor is resentful when Anton refuses his request to patch things up with Yegor's mother....

The incident in March prompted global outrage as protesters decried another killing of a black American by police. One of the officers likely to be dismissed obtained the search warrant for Ms Taylor's home in Kentucky. The other fired the shot that killed her, lawyers say. Ms Taylor, 26, died when police raided her home in connection to a drug case. Ms Taylor's boyfriend fired at the officers who he said he believed were attackers breaking into their home. Police say they knocked on the door to announce their presence before breaking down the door with a battering ram. Ms Taylor's boyfriend said police did not make their presence known, and he fired out of self-defence. Three officers returned fire with 32 shots, six of which hit Ms Taylor. Ms Taylor's name became a global rallying cry as people demanded a thorough investigation into her death. Of the police officers present at the raid, one has been sacked so far. Brett Hankison has pleaded not guilty to charges of wanton endangerment for firing three shots into adjoining apartments during the narcotics raid. In September a grand jury ruled that the two other officers should not face charges. In October, after a judge gave permission for jurors to speak about the secret proceedings, a juror said prosecutors had not given homicide or manslaughter charges for them to consider. One officer, Jonathan Mattingly, who shot Ms Taylor's boyfriend in the leg, later said the case had \\"nothing do with race\\". In the latest development, two officers received letters this week from Louisville police department that indicate they will soon be removed from their positions, according to the New York Times. Officer Joshua Jaynes was told that an investigation by the department found he had lied when preparing the paperwork to obtain permission to conduct the search of Ms Taylor's home, reported US media. The letter also said he did not plan the raid appropriately. \\"Because the operations plan was not completed properly, a very dangerous situation was created for all parties involved,\\" it said, according to CBS news. A lawyer representing Mr Jaynes told CBS that the officer had not created the plan himself and that senior colleagues were present when the warrant was signed off. Mr Jaynes will be allowed to defend himself against the claims on Thursday, CBS says. Officer Myles Cosgrove also received the notification. Kentucky's attorney general has said Mr Cosgrove fired the shot that killed Ms Taylor. Black Lives Matter activists in the US have demanded that Louisville police take stronger action against the officers in the case and say that police too often escape unpunished after killing members of the public. Racial injustice and inequality in the US was again thrust under the spotlight in 2020 following Ms Taylor's death and the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May. But the issue remains divisive. On Tuesday a statue of Ms Taylor erected in Oakland, California, was found smashed just two weeks after it was installed.

Answer:","output":"Whitney Houston, the iconic singer and actress, was found dead in her bathtub at the Beverly Hilton hotel on February 11, 2012. The official cause of her death was ruled as accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use as contributing factors by the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. The toxicology report revealed several substances in her system at the time of her death, including: 1. Cocaine: Cocaine use was determined to be a contributing factor to her death. The toxicology report indicated that Houston had used cocaine shortly before her death, and it had caused heart issues leading to her drowning. 2. Benzoylecgonine: This substance is a metabolite of cocaine, suggesting cocaine had been processed by her body. 3. Marijuana: The presence of a marijuana metabolite, THC-COOH, was detected in her system. 4. Xanax (Alprazolam): This prescription drug is a benzodiazepine used for treating anxiety and panic disorders. It was detected in her blood, but in therapeutic rather than toxic levels. 5. Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine): This is a muscle relaxant, which was also detected in her blood at therapeutic levels. 6. Benadryl (Diphenhydramine): An over-the-counter antihistamine medication used for allergies and cold symptoms, also found in her system at therapeutic levels. It is important to note that although several drugs were detected in Houston's system, the official cause of her death was determined to be accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use as contributing factors. Her struggles with substance abuse were well-documented throughout her life, and her untimely passing highlights the dangers of drug use and addiction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose mother was a devout Independent, unaffiliated with the Anglican Church? from the following article ?  According to the Dictionary of American Hymnology \\"Amazing Grace\\" is John Newton's spiritual autobiography in verse.In 1725, Newton was born in Wapping, a district in London near the Thames. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience. As a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \\"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\\" His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \\"Polly\\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love. After enduring humiliation for deserting, he managed to get himself traded to a slave ship where he began a career in slave trading.

An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to 1×10−5 s−1.On Earth, tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes, from 100–2,000 kilometres (62–1,243 mi) as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin. If the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude (222 km (138 mi)), then the cyclone is \\"very small\\" or a \\"midget\\". A radius of 3–6 latitude degrees (333–670 km (207–416 mi)) is considered \\"average sized\\". \\"Very large\\" tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8 degrees (888 km (552 mi)). Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed), radius of maximum wind, latitude, and maximum potential intensity.Size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.The upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere, which at low latitudes is 15,000–18,000 metres (50,000–60,000 ft).","output":"Given that the cyclone increases in size, the measurement of its outermost isobar will have increased."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

An American study suggests that being surrounded by happy friends and neighbours could have more of an effect on your happiness than money.That is the finding of researchers from Harvard University and the University of California at San Diego.     Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler studied the emotional health of more than 4,700 people.They used information from the Framingham Heart Study.That study began sixty years ago in the American community of Framingham.Massachusetts.It was started to learn more about the risks of heart attack and stroke.          For the new study,the researchers examined the emotions of the men and women in the Framingham Heart Study.The information was gathered from 1983 to 2003.     The researchers found that friends of happy people had a greater chance of being happy themselves.That means that happiness spreads,or has a contagious effect,among people.And,the smaller the physical distance between friends,the larger the effect they had on each other's happiness.     Sadness was also contagious among friends,but not as much as happiness.The researchers say social groups did not influence happiness as much as personal situations.   However,people removed by as much as three degrees of separation still had an effect on one's  happiness.The expression three degrees of separation means the friends of an individual's  friends.     In fact,persons with three degrees of separation had a greater effect on an individual's   happiness than having five thousand dollars.The researchers say the study is historic because it shows that social effects on health can be spread among people.     Another finding is that people who work together or are married do not have as much of an effect on happiness levels as friends.The researchers say this is often true among friends of the same sex. Question: The conclusion of the new study is_. Options: A: the emotional health plays an important part in an individual's  physical health B: being surrounded by friends can bring happiness to all individual C: happiness can be spread and have an active effect on friends D: the physical distance between friends has no connection with happiness","output":"C: happiness can be spread and have an active effect on friends"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose initial musical education is unclear?, using the article: George Frideric Handel was born on 23 February 1685 in the German city of Halle. It is unclear what initial musical education he received; his father, Georg Händel, was not a music lover, and did not at first appreciate or encourage his son's precocious talents. Nevertheless, by the age of ten Handel had become an accomplished organist; his playing in the royal chapel at Weissenfels, where his half-brother Karl was in the service of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, impressed the duke, who persuaded Händel senior that the boy should have a proper musical education. As a result, Handel began formal study under Friedrich Zachow, the organist of the Lutheran church at Halle.Handel's biographer Jonathan Keates writes that: \\"From [Zachow] Handel learned not only a great deal about the line and shape of an aria, about strong, adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing, but also about those delicacies of instrumental colouring which he later perfected in his own style\\". Handel's musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with Georg Philipp Telemann, whom he met in 1700. In February 1702 Handel enrolled at the University of Halle, perhaps intending to study law. In March he took up the post of organist at Halle's Calvinist cathedral (Domkirche), a prestigious appointment for one so young and indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in the city.At some time, possibly in late 1702 or early 1703, Handel visited Berlin, where his father had held an honorary post as physician to the elector who, in 1701, had become the Prussian king Frederick I. In Berlin Handel first experienced Italian opera, and may have met the Italian composers Giovanni Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti, who were writing operas for Frederick's court. The king heard of Handel's abilities, and wanted him to train as a future court composer, but Handel's horizons had been broadened by his sojourn in Berlin and he was developing his own ideas for his future. He declined the king's offer, and returned to Halle to fulfil..., what would be the answer ?","output":"The last name of the person whose initial musical education is unclear is Handel. George Frideric Handel was a renowned German composer whose early musical training was not well-documented due to his father's, Georg Händel's, lack of interest in music and initial discouragement of his son's talents. Despite this uncertainty, it is evident that George Frideric Handel possessed an immense musical talent from a young age and went on to have a highly successful and influential career in music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: How China's Richest Man is Reinventing Dalian Wanda Group The first thing you should know about China’s richest man, Wang Jianlin, is that he’s not afraid to go big. When his Dalian Wanda Group conglomerate opened its first “theme park city” this May, in the small Chinese city of Nanchang, it stretched across two square kilometers, doubling as China’s largest new tourist trap and ammo for Wang’s outsized ambitions for taking on Disney. “The frenzy of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and the era of blindly following them have passed,” Wang told China’s CCTV the week before the Nanchang unveiling, in words that were brash even by the outspoken billionaire’s standards. Disney’s new Shanghai park was set to open the following month, but Wang said his park—along with 15 to 20 more that he plans to build—would keep it unprofitable for the next decade. Of Disney dis , he added, “They shouldn’t have entered China.” Not that Wang himself has any trouble crossing borders. Two months later, in mid-July, Wanda was reported to be in the running for a 49% stake in Paramount Pictures, the Hollywood studio controlled by Viacom viab that dates back more than 100 years. The studio’s total valuation might run as high as 8 billion to 10 billion. If Wang were to win the bidding, it would be Asia’s biggest deal in Hollywood since Sony bought Columbia Pictures in the 1980s. And it would top Wang’s last Hollywood deal, which happened just six months ago. In January Wanda spent 3.5 billion on the movie production house Legendary Entertainment, the producer behind Jurassic World and the Hangover trilogy. Even aside from its Hollywood and theme park aspirations, Wanda has been growing—and growing abroad—so fast that the world outside China has begun to pay attention. In 2015 alone, Wanda bought race organizer World Triathlon Corp.; Infront Sports & Media, which is selling Asian broadcasting rights to the next two soccer World Cups; and a stake in Spanish soccer club Atletico Madrid, for a total of 5 billion in overseas spending during the year. Back home, its sprawling web of malls and real estate generated enough cash for Wanda to make the Fortune Global 500 list for the first time this year. Wanda ranks No. 385 on the global list, with 27.4 billion in sales and 2.4 billion in profits in 2015, up 18.8% from 23 billion in 2014. If Wanda were an American company, it would rank just above Macy’s m in sales and not far behind entertainment giant Time Warner twx . Wanda’s route to the list, however, has been anything but ordinary. By Wanda’s own count, it is on its fourth company-wide transformation in less than three decades, having started as a small, state-owned real estate developer in the northeast coastal city of Dalian. Its ongoing rise reflects the growing clout of Wang, who has proven himself to be both an inventive businessman and a favored government friend in an economy where such ties are important. Now, he and Wanda are helping China spread its soft power abroad, through everything from stakes in foreign companies to constructions projects along the Thames in London and in downtown Chicago. Wang, 61, was born to a father who served in Chairman Mao’s revolutionary army. Wang himself joined the People’s Liberation Army at the age of 15. But at 32, after tiring of his own officer track, he left for a government job. Wang eventually joined the Xigang Development Company, a residential developer in Dalian, a port city and trading hub near China’s border with North Korea. Wang revived the failing state-owned builder after getting an army buddy’s help securing a loan. He changed the firm’s name from the lifeless Xigang to Wanda (which means “everything being accomplished”) after soliciting names through a newspaper contest. As China tested its first market reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Wanda became one of the country’s first companies to issue shares; it privatized over the following years, with Wang becoming its largest shareholder. Tourists visit the Wanda Group’s newly open “theme park city” in Nanchang.Photograph by STR AFP/Getty Images Wanda expanded beyond Dalian and went national in the early 1990s, completing what became its first transformation. It then branched into commercial properties beginning in 2000, when the company’s shopping malls—called Wanda Plazas—began dotting the country. That was its second transformation; a third came as the company branched into tourist projects in the late 2000s. Wang, meanwhile, became a public figure whose slender-cut Western suits and widow’s peak gave the appearance of a leader straight from an executive MBA program, belying his relatively humble origins. Wanda’s fourth transformation started last year, as the company began spreading its money around the world. Wang plans to flip Wanda’s focus from real estate to a few key domestic services sectors. By 2018, Wanda expects two-thirds of its sales to come from consumer services, up from about 40% last year, with an emphasis on tourism, entertainment and sports. Those three sectors happen to be three main drivers of China’s transition into a consumer-led economy, and the government has declared that expanding them is a priority. The ruling State Council released a goal last October to nearly double the value of sports as a percentage of China’s GDP (currently 0.63%), which would make it a 775 billion sector by 2025. “If you can leverage favorable policies, it’s good,” says Wang Xin, president of Greater China for consultancy Frost and Sullivan, of Wanda’s strategy. “In the long haul it’s not about leveraging policies alone, it’s about understanding future trends.” Wang doesn’t hide the fact that Wanda chases government-sponsored trends. “Wanda’s transformation is consistent with China’s economic strategy,” he said in a 2015 speech in China. The State Council released guidelines several years ago encouraging private companies to expand globally: “It can be said that Wanda answered that call,” Wang told Harvard Business School students last October. Wanda Group did not make Wang available for an interview. But Liu Mingsheng, a spokesman, said of the company’s strategy, “The entire Chinese economy is going through transitions. The main objective is to achieve a state of economic growth that is based on domestic consumption. Wanda’s transition is consistent with China’s economic strategy.” Wang’s rise accelerated in 2007, around the time that investors related to top government officials began taking stakes in his private firm. Until then, Wanda had only one other outside shareholder. Wanda was little known, and Wang not yet a billionaire. By last year he had passed Alibaba’s Jack Ma as China’s richest man, worth 34 billion, according to the Hurun Rich List, an annual ranking of China’s wealthiest individuals. Wang Jianlin (back row, 3rd from left) and other Wanda Group and Legendary Entertainment officials during the signing ceremony as Wanda buys Legendary, on January 12, 2016 in Beijing. (Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images)VCG VCG via Getty Images According to a 2015 investigation by Michael Forsythe in the New York Times, stakes in Wanda were offered to business partners and relatives of two then-members of the ruling Politburo, and later to the sister of China’s now president, Xi Jinping. In one example, an investor’s stakes multiplied from the 500,000 and 200,000 they paid to more than 900 million. There is nothing illegal about the deals, and Wang has emphasized Wanda does not pay bribes. Wang also appears to have come through Xi’s anti-corruption drive unscathed. Wang responded to the Times report in the speech at Harvard last October, saying Xi’s sister and her husband, Deng Jiagui, sold their shares in the Dalian Commercial Properties unit before it went public in 2014. “Deng sold all the shares held by his investment company and fully exited at a low price point,” Wang said. Still, the financial interactions underscore Wanda’s closeness to Chinese leaders and state institutions and leave the impression of Wang as a favored son. When Wanda bought the U.S. theater chain AMC in 2012, beginning a string of overseas acquisitions, a group of state banks including the government’s State Export-Import Bank helped finance the 2.6 billion deal, offering aid that private-sector companies seldom get. “China still has a long way to go to build its own soft power,” wrote state-run nationalist tabloid Global Times earlier this year. “Companies like Wanda are pioneers on the road of China’s modernization and they deserve more encouragement.” Wanda’s latest transition into consumer services brings it even closer to the government. As part of its move, Wanda wants to reduce the need to invest huge piles of its own money in real estate development. Although it plans to expand the number Wanda Plazas—it will open 55 this year, it says, for a total of around 180—more than 20 of those will be funded by outside investors who hold the land, usually governments or government-affiliated companies. Wanda will share the rental income, but will save its capital for projects like the Nanchang theme park, overseas acquisitions, and a movie studio Wanda is building in coastal Qingdao to rival those in Hollywood. Earlier this year, Wang laid out Wanda’s goals for the next five years. By the end of 2020, he says, the company will reach 100 billion in sales and 10 billion in profits, and overseas sales will bring in 30% of the total. The company treats the figures almost as military orders. Managers head to daily management meetings and see numbers changing from green to yellow to red on their computers, depending on their progress toward these goals. These are audacious figures, not least because Wanda’s sales are expected to fall this year amid a real estate slowdown that has forced many department stores in its malls to close. Wanda says overall sales will fall by 12% in 2016. Unless it goes on a hyperbolic growth streak starting in 2017, expanding sales more than 25% a year, the 100 billion goal looks out of reach. People wear 3-D glasses while watching a movie in a Wanda Plaza cinema in Tongzhou, China.Tomohiro Ohsumi — Bloomberg via Getty Images But 100 billion by 2020 is probably not Wanda’s ultimate goal, anymore than keeping Shanghai Disneyland unprofitable for a decade is a real strategic objective. Instead, Wang wants Wanda to become an international brand, with the same name recognition as Microsoft, Apple, and Walmart. “That’s my dream,” he said at Harvard. That aligns very closely with the Chinese government’s goal: a strong Chinese private-sector presence on the world’s corporate stage, where the country now is represented only by a handful of state-owned banks and energy giants, and a couple of tech companies. Wang is a natural spokesman for a newly assertive China: he’s savvy, sanguine, and brash. At Harvard, he opined on how long it might take for Wanda to become a real international brand. “Speaking of when I could achieve it, maybe in 4 or 5 years the fastest,” he said. “Or 7 to 8 years in a slower pace.” If Wang does reach that goal, it will be both Wanda and China sharing the international stage.

Trine has hardly any large open spaces on the ground. The Jimpy forest, on the other hand, is much more open. It has some large areas in the forest that are perfect for camping or for children to play in due to the lack of trees.  Which forest would require a higher temperature to burn?","output":"To determine which forest—Trine or Jimpy—would require a higher temperature to burn, we must consider multiple factors such as tree density, species of trees, moisture content, and distribution of fuel. All of these elements play a crucial role in the likelihood of a forest catching fire and the intensity of the subsequent blaze.  Trine forest, being tightly packed with trees, would have a higher tree density than Jimpy forest. This means there is an abundance of fuel, as trees are the primary source of it. Additionally, in a forest with more trees, the canopy layer becomes denser, trapping heat and potentially increasing the risk of the fire spreading rapidly in the crowns of the trees. Furthermore, with little open space between trees, there may be more accumulation of dead plant material such as leaves, branches, and logs, which provide even more fuel for a fire. However, the species of trees in both Trine and Jimpy forests are also important in determining their susceptibility to fires. Different species carry different flammability and resistance to fire. For instance, trees with resinous bark, like pine and spruce trees, are more likely to catch fire than trees with thicker bark, like oak and maple trees. Therefore, the forest with a higher concentration of more flammable tree species would be more susceptible to burning. Moisture content is another crucial factor to consider when assessing the likelihood of a forest fire. Apart from the forest's vegetation, conditions like soil moisture and air humidity influence the likelihood and rate of fire spreading. In areas with higher tree density and less open space, such as Trine forest, there might be higher humidity due to less sunlight reaching the ground and evaporating moisture. This scenario could make it harder to ignite fires and make them spread and grow. However, a prolonged dry period could still leave the forest vulnerable to fires. Considering fuel distribution, Trine forest's tightly packed trees and fewer open spaces might create a continuous fuel landscape that could enable fires to spread more easily, while the more open Jimpy forest might have breaks in fuel sources that could hinder the fire's spread. Given the factors discussed, it is difficult to definitively determine which forest would require a higher temperature to burn without further information about the types of trees, the moisture content, and related forest conditions. However, based on the tree density and fuel availability alone, Trine forest might have a higher propensity to burn, especially if the tree species are highly flammable. Thus, it may require a lower temperature to ignite and sustain fire compared to the more open Jimpy forest. However, it is important to remember that unique combinations of factors like tree species, moisture, and fuel distribution must be considered to accurately evaluate these forests' potential to burn."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which would be the best option in canada between MS and PG? Is MS in Canada a better option than in the PG? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose your answer from: a). no; b). yes;","output":"The phrases \\"MS\\" and \\"PG\\" typically refer to Master of Science and Postgraduate Diploma, respectively. Both are educational qualifications in Canada, but they have different scopes, durations, and outcomes. Before comparing the two, it is important to note that the questions you put forth are quite similar, as both are asking for a comparison between MS and PG in Canada, and therefore, the answer to the question on their similarity would be (b) yes. However, determining which option is better will depend on your personal preferences, field of study, and career goals. 1. Program Duration: The most apparent difference between MS and PG is the program duration. Typically, MS programs require a longer study period to complete than PG. A full-time MS program in Canada generally lasts around two years, whereas a full-time PG diploma program spans for about one year (could extend to two years, depending on the program and college). This distinction could play a significant role in your decision-making, as a shorter program may align better with your time constraints and financial capabilities. 2. Course Curriculum: MS programs in Canada are usually more research-based and theoretical, involving in-depth studies in a particular area. This program equips students with the skills and knowledge to pursue further research or academic careers. On the other hand, PG diploma programs are more industry-oriented, with a focus on practical skills and knowledge that can be directly applied in the workplace. The diploma programs are tailored to equip students for specific professional domains. 3. Eligibility and Admission: MS programs in Canadian universities might be more competitive when it comes to admissions, as they often require a higher academic performance from applicants. The eligibility criteria for PG programs may be less demanding, offering greater opportunities for individuals seeking to gain skills and knowledge in their field but with fewer academic qualifications. 4. Cost: MS programs are usually more expensive than PG diploma programs because of their longer duration. However, opportunities for funding, scholarships, and research assistantships can help offset the cost of pursuing an MS in Canada. Overall, the cost of education will depend on the university and program chosen. It's essential to consider the financial implications and potential return on investment when selecting a pathway. 5. Career Prospects: MS might offer broader career prospects, as it is considered a higher level of education than a PG diploma. MS graduates can enter academia, research-based positions, or professional roles that require specialized skills and knowledge. On the other hand, PG diploma graduates may be suitable for roles that require practical, hands-on skills. The job market for each qualification varies depending on the field and local demands. 6. Potential for Further Education: MS graduates can generally pursue a Ph.D., as their research skills and background in advanced academics have prepared them for doctoral studies. PG diploma holders might not hold the same advantage due to their more applied and vocational focus. In conclusion, the better option between MS and PG diploma in Canada depends on your personal preferences, financial capabilities, time constraints, and long-term career goals. If you are looking for in-depth research, an opportunity to pursue a Ph.D., and a higher level of education, an MS might suit your objectives. Conversely, if you desire practical skills, industry-oriented knowledge, and a faster route to potential employment, a PG diploma might be the better choice for you."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who used instruments of the continuo group as independent parts? ?  Bach's early cantatas are Choralkonzerte (chorale concertos) in the style of the 17th century, different from the recitative and aria cantata format associated with Neumeister that Bach started to use for church cantatas in 1714. Wolff points out the relation of Bach's early cantatas to works by Dieterich Buxtehude, with whom Bach had studied in Lübeck. Christ lag in Todes Banden shows similarities to a composition of Johann Pachelbel based on the same Easter chorale. Although there is no evidence that Bach and Pachelbel met, Bach grew up in Thuringia while Pachelbel was based in the same region, and Bach's elder brother and teacher Johann Christoph Bach studied with Pachelbel in Erfurt. Another of Pachelbel's works appears to be referenced in the early Bach cantata, Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150, and there has been recent speculation that Bach wanted to pay tribute to Pachelbel after his death in 1706.The texts for the early cantatas were drawn mostly from biblical passages and hymns. Features characteristic of his later cantatas, such as recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry, were not yet present, although Bach may have heard them in oratorios by Buxtehude, or even earlier. Instead, these early cantatas include 17th-century elements such as motets and chorale concertos. They often begin with an instrumental sinfonia or sonata (sonatina). The following table lists the seven extant works composed by Bach until 1708, when he moved on to the Weimar court. Bach uses the limited types of instruments at his disposal for unusual combinations, such as two recorders and two viole da gamba in the funeral cantata Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, also known as Actus Tragicus. He uses instruments of the continuo group as independent parts, such as a cello in Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich and a bassoon in Der Herr denket an uns. The cantata for the inauguration of a town council is richly scored for trumpets, woodwinds and strings. Wolff notes: The overall degree of mastery by which these early...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question: crimes that do not require mens rea are known as??","output":"Crimes that do not require mens rea are known as strict liability offenses. The term mens rea, which is derived from Latin, means \\"guilty mind\\" and is a fundamental principle in criminal law. It refers to the mental element or intent to commit a crime, demonstrating that the accused was aware of the consequences of their actions and intended to perform the criminal act. Most criminal offenses require both mens rea and actus reus (the physical act of committing the crime) to establish guilt. Strict liability offenses, on the other hand, do not require the prosecution to prove that the accused had any criminal intent. In these cases, it is only necessary to prove that the accused committed the act in question, without demonstrating any intent or knowledge of committing an unlawful act. The rationale behind strict liability offenses is that in specific instances, protecting society and enforcing certain regulations is more critical than punishing those with a guilty mind. Strict liability crimes are typically established by statutory laws and may vary depending on the jurisdiction. The primary objective behind strict liability offenses is to promote compliance with the law, ensure public safety, or regulate conduct in areas where negligence can result in serious harm. Common examples of strict liability offenses include: 1. Traffic violations: Speeding, parking violations, and running red lights are considered strict liability offenses, where the precise intent behind the action is irrelevant, and the mere act of committing the offense is enough to establish guilt. 2. Statutory rape: In many jurisdictions, statutory rape is a strict liability offense where engaging in sexual acts with a minor is considered a criminal act, regardless of whether the accused knew that the other person was underage. 3. Product safety: Manufacturers, distributors, and retailers may be held strictly liable for selling defective or dangerous products, irrespective of whether they were aware of the defects. The goal is to encourage businesses to ensure product safety. 4. Environmental and public health regulations: Companies that violate pollution control and environmental protection regulations may be held strictly liable, regardless of whether they intended to harm the environment or knew about their actions violating the law. Although strict liability offenses help ensure compliance with essential regulations, they can be controversial as they may result in punishment without the presence of a guilty intent. Critics argue that without the requirement of mens rea, strict liability offenses may undermine the principle of justice that only those who have a \\"guilty mind\\" should be held criminally accountable. Regardless, strict liability offenses remain an essential part of criminal law in many jurisdictions and continue to be used as a tool to deter harmful or negligent behavior and maintain public safety and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper.

Chris orders water with molecules closer together. The waiter looks at them with a rather confused look and asks them to please elaborate.  Hint: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.

He went to the local consumer electronics store to find himself a good camera. Two cameras caught his eye, camera A and camera B. Camera A had a very small pinhole, but camera B had larger aperture. David needs to decide which camera should he buy.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which camera would have higher beam quality?  Hint: In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength (longer wavelengths require larger apertures). If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired.  The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases. A:","output":"In the context of the information provided, we can determine that Camera A with the small pinhole would have a higher beam quality than Camera B with the larger aperture. The paragraph explains that the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength. It is also mentioned that if the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved, although at the cost of reduced power. On the other hand, if the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much. We can infer from this information that Camera A, with a very small pinhole, is likely to have better beam quality due to the smaller aperture. The drawback of this design choice is that it may result in reduced power. However, it should be noted that if David intends to use a focusing lens with a low f-number and can ensure that the lens will not add significant aberrations to the beam, the smaller pinhole in Camera A would be an optimal choice for higher beam quality.

The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

However, he also competes with Minnie Crozier and Mackenzie Choat. This competition could refer to their personal relationships with Fergus, or it could be a separate challenge or situation altogether. The main focus of this sentence centers around the individual dating Fergus, while Minnie and Mackenzie serve as secondary characters with whom he competes in some unspecified context. 2. \\"He started to date Minnie Crozier (Katrina Devine) but clashed with both Fergus Kearney (Paul Ellis) and Mackenzie Choat (Ingrid Park).\\" In this sentence, the individual starts dating Minnie Crozier. At the same time, he experiences conflicts with both Fergus Kearney and Mackenzie Choat. The term \\"clashed\\" implies a disagreement or conflict.

However, the first sentence states that he dates Fergus Kearney and competes with Minnie Crozier and Mackenzie Choat, whereas the second sentence says he dates Minnie Crozier and clashes with Fergus Kearney and Mackenzie Choat.

Vary the blossoms in height and color evenly throughout the arrangement. Tuck smaller flowers or buds around the edges. Keep taller plants toward the center and top. For example, arrange aster, blue veronica, blue lisianthus, and larkspur as the base colors. Add accents to the color scheme with red dahlias and “Black Prince” snapdragons inserted between the lighter hues. Do this constantly as you place the flowers inside it. Rotation will ensure you don't neglect any one area and give an even hand to the entire bouquet. When you’re satisfied with the appearance of the bouquet, tie the stems together  right at the waterline. This will pack the flowers tightly together and force them to support one another.  Use a clear elastic band to avoid detracting attention from the flowers. Use twine for a more rustic appearance. Use ribbon to add a decorative touch to a bridal bouquet. Like all organic material, dead flowers emit methane (a greenhouse gas 24 times as powerful as CO2) when taken to the landfill. Get crafty by reusing your flowers as they begin to wilt and die. Use your new creations as home décor or as unique gifts. If you have a compost heap or a municipal composting program, you can reuse your flowers by turning them into organic fertilizer. Just make sure your flowers were not treated with chemicals or grown with genetically modified seeds beforehand.","output":"Create stable, eye-catching floral arrangements by placing larger, vivid blossoms first, surrounding them with smaller buds or blooms and evenly distributing colors, while providing support with branches or twigs, and repurpose wilted flowers for compost or crafts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There is a tan dog running on the grass. 2. There is a brown dog running close behind the tan dog. From the given statement, we can infer the following facts: - Both dogs are running: the tan dog and the brown dog. - They are both on the same surface: the grass. - The brown dog is running close behind the tan dog, indicating that it is following the tan dog. Conclusion: One dog (the brown dog) is following another dog (the tan dog) on the grass. The conclusion is a logical deduction from the given statement as it encapsulates the main idea from the original statement by stating that one dog is following another dog on the grass. It doesn't mention the color of the dogs, but it retains the essential information about the spatial relationship between the two dogs and their shared environment (the grass).

Question: This article: Farsari and other 19th-century commercial photographers generally concentrated on two types of subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the \\"manners and customs\\" of its inhabitants. Such subjects, and the ways in which they were literally and figuratively framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; and the reason for this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, had much to do with economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō \\"per head\\", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting \\"manners and customs\\".In 1885, Charles J. S. Makin used some of Farsari's views to illustrate his travel account Land of the Rising Sun, Being a Short Account of Japan and the Japanese. As photomechanical printing was still in its infancy, it was common for artists and illustrators to create works derived from photographs. For example, Charles Wirgman's numerous engravings for the Illustrated London News were made from views by Wirgman's friend and sometime partner Felice Beato. Occasionally the link between a work of art and its photographic source material was less overt: Louis-Jules Dumoulin's 1888 oil painting Boys' Festival from the Bluff, Yokohama [sic] (now called Carp Banners in Kyoto) draws heavily from Farsari's photograph Gionmachi, Kioto (now often called View of Shijō-dōri, Kyoto); although the painted image strongly resembles the photographic source, the location of the subject has been changed in the title.

Question: What does Asa's plan to drain Katia off? Movie title: La maschera del demonio/Black Sunday Movie plot: In Moldavia, in the year 1630, beautiful witch Asa Vajda (Barbara Steele) and her paramour Javuto (Arturo Dominici) are sentenced to death for sorcery by Asa's brother. Before being burned at the stake, Asa vows revenge and puts a curse on her brother's descendants. A metal mask with sharp spikes on the inside is placed over the witch's face and hammered into her flesh. Two centuries later, Dr. Thomas Kruvajan (Andrea Checchi) and his assistant Dr. Andre Gorobec (John Richardson), are traveling through Moldavia en route to a medical conference when one of the wheels of their carriage is broken, requiring immediate repair. While waiting for their coachman to fix it, the two wander into a nearby ancient crypt and discover Asa's tomb. Observing her death mask through a glass panel, Kruvajan breaks the panel (and the cross above it) by accident while striking a bat. He then removes Asa's death mask revealing a partially preserved corpse that is visible underneath, her face staring out malevolently. He cuts his hand on the broken glass. Some of his blood drips onto Asa's dead face. Returning outside, Kruvajan and Gorobec meet Katia (also played by Steele). She tells them that she lives with her father, Prince Vajda (Garrani), and brother Constantine (Enrico Oliveiri) in a nearby castle that the villagers all believe is haunted. Gorobec is instantly smitten by the beautiful young woman. The two men then leave her and drive to an inn. The witch Asa is brought back to life by Kruvajan's blood. She contacts Javuto telepathically and orders him to rise from his grave. He does so and goes to Prince Vajda's castle, where Vajda holds up a crucifix to ward the reanimated corpse away. However, Vajda is so terrified by the visit that he becomes paralyzed with fear. Katia and Constantin send a servant to fetch Dr. Kruvajan, but the servant is killed before he can reach the inn. It is the evil Javuto who arrives to bring Kruvajan to the castle. Javuto leads Kruvajan to Asa's crypt, and Kruvajan watches in horror as her coffin... Answer:","output":"Asa's plan to \\"drain Katia off\\" refers to Asa's intention to drain the life and vitality from Katia in order to maintain and strengthen her own resurrected existence. This process is a common trope in films with supernatural themes, especially those involving witches, vampires, and other undead creatures.

Damien Gayle. PUBLISHED:. 06:11 EST, 20 March 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:36 EST, 20 March 2013. Former International Space Station commander Suni Williams has lifted the lid on how astronauts aboard go to the toilet in space. Personnel aboard the ISS often spend months at a time in space, so effective facilities for using the smallest room in zero gravity are essential. Captain Williams, who holds the record for the longest space flight by a woman at 195 days, revealed details of the 'orbital outhouse' in a video tour of the station. Stinky: Former International Space Station commander Suni Williams demonstrates the orbiter's smallest room in space in a Nasa video. Her tour of the £12.5million facilities showed that it is apparently all a case of docking and alignment when it comes to going to the toilet in space. The toilet, she explains, unsurprisingly 'serves for two functions' - number one and number two - with different colour-coded receptacles to accept each. Pointing out the number two loo, she says: 'You see it's pretty small and you have to have pretty good aim, and be ready to make sure things get let go in the right direction.' Pinching her nose, she adds: 'And it smells a little bit, so I'm closing it up.' This is for number ones... Captain Williams holds up the colour-coded tube where astronauts urinate. And this is for number two: Both units have suction 'to keep things going in the right direction', she revealed. 'Also there's a selection of paper,' she says, including a soft kind for U.S. astronauts and a coarser, rough variety preferred by Russian cosmonauts. Captain Williams, a U.S. Navy test pilot pilot who has over seven missions spend a total of almost 322 days in space, says the crew are provided with gloves, nappies and disinfectant wipes, 'in case things really get out of control'. 'The number one stuff can get really all over the place if you don't aim correctly,' she warns. Although, she adds, both toilets have a little bit of suction to keep things 'going in the right direction'. For that fresh feeling: Captain Williams points out the baby wipes made available for astronauts. A little privacy please... Captain Williams slides shut the folding door that preserves astronauts' modesty. Of course, that's assuming that all the high-tech components aboard the ISS keep working as designed. In 2009 there was a crisis aboard the station when its main toilet broke down with a record 13 people aboard. One of the pumps in the crew's main bathroom flooded, which is connected to the station's wastewater-recycling system. Astronauts were forced to don goggles, gloves and masks for some impromptu plumbing. They ripped apart the compartment, working well into the evening but failed to solve the problem until spare parts were sent from Earth.","output":"1.

As the night goes on and the party starts buzzing, confidence will be key to successfully meeting a girl. After all, feeling good in your outfit can boost your self-esteem and make you more approachable. Remember to groom yourself well and wear a light, pleasant fragrance - you don't want to overwhelm anyone with a strong scent. Maintaining good posture and making eye contact are also important aspects of body language that will make you appear more approachable and engaged. A smile will be your best accessory; it's inviting and shows that you're genuinely enjoying yourself. Once you feel ready, take a moment to scope out the room, and observe the party's vibe. Try to find a group or individual that has caught your eye, preferably someone who shares common interests. This will make striking up a conversation more natural and comfortable. When you approach the girl you want to meet, remember to ease into the conversation — don't charge in and start firing off questions. Start with small talk or a light comment about the party, the music, or a mutual friend, and then proceed to ask open-ended questions. This will engage her in conversation and make her feel more at ease. Pay attention to her responses, and listen actively, showing genuine interest in getting to know her better. While chatting, be aware of the girl's body language and overall reception to your advances. If she appears uninterested or closed off, don't push too hard or force her to engage. This might make her uncomfortable or create an undesirable impression. Instead, accept the outcome and excuse yourself gracefully, while leaving the door open for potential future interactions. As the night progresses and you've successfully connected with the girl, continue building on that rapport. Show your sense of humor, but also be curious and attentive to her thoughts and stories. At some point in the conversation, gauge whether or not it is appropriate to ask for her phone number or social media contact details, ensuring that you've laid the groundwork for future conversations and meetings. In conclusion, meeting a girl at a party is a delicate process that requires confidence, patience, and active engagement in conversation. Presenting yourself well, wearing your favorite clothes, and being conscious of your body language are the first steps towards a successful interaction that can potentially lead to a deeper connection. So, the next time you find yourself at a party, remember these tips, and create long-lasting connections while having a fantastic time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He signals his intentions by swimming around the female with flared fins, attempting to draw her to the nest where he will continue his courting display. If the female accepts the male she will begin swimming in circles with the male beneath the bubble nest. When she is ready to spawn she touches the male on either the back or the tail with her mouth. Upon this signal the male will embrace the female, turning her first on her side and finally on her back. At this point the female will release approximately five dozen clear eggs, which are immediately fertilized by the male. Most of the eggs will float up into the bubble nest. Eggs that stray are collected by the male and placed in the nest. Once all the eggs are secured in the nest, the pair will spawn again. If more than one female is present in the breeding tank, the male may spawn with all of them. The spawning sessions will continue for two to four hours, and produce between 300 and 800 eggs. Dwarf gouramis have a fecundity of about 600 eggs.(1) Upon completion, the male will place a fine layer of bubbles beneath the eggs, assuring that they remain in the bubble nest.The male will protect the eggs and fry. In 12 to 24 hours the fry will hatch, and continue developing within the protection of the bubble nest. After three days they are sufficiently developed to be free swimming and leave the nest. When the fry are two to three days old the male should also be removed or he may consume the young. Question: can male and female dwarf gouramis live together?

Hawkes admitted she had developed \\"a very great liking\\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \\"a daemonic energy\\", with his accomplishments in India being \\"almost superhuman\\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K. Elbinger, before the 1947 Hindu–Muslim riots. In a 2003 volume of the South Asian Studies journal, Sudeshna Gusha published a research article examining Wheeler's use of photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent. In 2011, the academic journal Public Archaeology published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler's role in presenting archaeology to the British public. Two years later, the Papers from the Institute of Archaeology issued a short comic strip by Moshenska and Alex Salamunovich depicting Wheeler's activities in studying the archaeology of Libya during World War II., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","output":"The first name of the person who was the subject of a short comic strip by Moshenska and Alex Salamunovich is Mortimer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: When we got married we thought it was going to be all bliss and happiness for life. By about week two we both had an awakening. Something about being exact opposites and together 24/7. We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was. We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other. Well actually, there have been probably a couple of those days for my wife. She’s just too nice to say it. A great marriage isn’t built because it’s perfect.

Square dancing, one of the oldest forms of American folk dancing, developed from several different Old World group dances, mainly English country dances, and the French quadrille . In the American version of square dancing, four couples form a square and dance to music. An American addition to square dancing is the caller. What do you think a caller does? The callers---someone who calls out the dance steps in time to the music--- was a completely American invention. At first dancers memorized all the steps for a particular dance, but eventually the dances became so complicated that it was necessary to have someone call out cues   so that dancers didn't have to remember so many steps. The caller didn't just call out \\"do-se-do your partner\\"; a good caller also came up with colorful sayings or witty lines that he said in between the cues such as \\"Don't be shy and don't be afraid. Swing on the corner in a waltz promenade  .\\" A caller might also come up with new dance steps and routines. Although popular for years, square dancing seemed to be going out of style and fading away until the early 1930s, when Henry Ford helped revive interest in it. Ford, the automobile manufacturer, used to vacation at the Wayside Inn in Massachusetts, where he enjoyed the dance programme run by a man named Benjamin Lovett. Ford asked Lovett to come to Detroit and teach dances, but Lovett said he couldn't because he had a contract with the inn. Ford solved that problem by buying the inn and Lovett's contract. He took Lovett back to Detroit, where together they established a programme for teaching squares and rounds. Square dancing was updated and groups began forming all over the country.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Cebidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It includes the capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys. These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical South and Central America.  - The Pliocene (also Pleiocene) Epoch is the epoch in the geologic timescale that extends from 5.333 million to 2.58 million years BP. It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago, and is now included in the Pleistocene.  - A primate is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: \\"prime, first rank\\"). In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - A prehensile tail is the tail of an animal that has adapted to be able to grasp or hold objects. Fully prehensile tails can be used to hold and manipulate objects, and in particular to aid arboreal creatures in finding and eating food in the trees. If the tail cannot be used for this it is considered only partially prehensile - such tails are often used to anchor an animal's body to dangle from a branch, or as an aid for climbing. The term \\"prehensile\\" means \\"able to grasp\\" (from the Latin \\"prehendere\\", to take hold of, to grasp).  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay.  - Apes (Hominoidea) are a branch of Old World tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are the sister group of Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes.  - The Atelidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It was formerly included in the family Cebidae. Atelids are generally larger monkeys; the family includes the howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys (the latter being the largest of the New World monkeys). They are found throughout the forested regions of Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina.  - New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America and portions of Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Platyrrhini parvorder and the Ceboidea superfamily, which are essentially synonymous since Ceboidea is the only living platyrrhine superfamily. Platyrhini means flat-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (\\"down-nosed,\\" comprising Old World monkeys and apes). New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Catarrhini is one of the two subdivisions of the simians, the other being the plathyrrhine (New World monkeys). The Catarrhini contains the Old World monkeys and the apes; the latter of which are in turn further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes, consisting of the orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. The Catarrhine are all native to Africa and Asia. Members of this parvorder are called catarrhines.  - Spider monkeys of the genus Ateles are New World monkeys in the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, all of which are under threat; the black-headed spider monkey, and brown spider monkey are critically endangered.  - The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets and tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae.  - The Miocene is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about (Ma). The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words (', less) and (', new) and means \\"less recent\\" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. The Miocene follows the Oligocene Epoch and is followed by the Pliocene Epoch.  - The Old World monkeys or Cercopithecidae are a family of primates, the only family in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea in the clade (or parvorder) of Catarrhini.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Monkeys are haplorhine (\\"dry-nosed\\") primates, a group generally possessing tails and consisting of about 260 known living species. There are two distinct lineages of monkeys: New World Monkeys and catarrhines. Apes emerged within the catarrhines with the Old World monkeys as a sister group, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. However, traditionally apes are not considered monkeys, rendering this grouping paraphyletic. The equivalent monophyletic clade are the simians. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys.  - Sir Charles Lyell, 1st Baronet, (14 November 1797  22 February 1875) was a British lawyer and the foremost geologist of his day. He is best known as the author of \\"Principles of Geology\\", which popularized James Hutton's concepts of uniformitarianismthe idea that the Earth was shaped by the same processes still in operation today. \\"Principles of Geology\\" also challenged theories popularized by Georges Cuvier, which were the most accepted and circulated ideas about geology in England at the time.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - The Neogene is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary.  - The Pitheciidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. Formerly, they were included in the family Atelidae. The family includes the titis, saki monkeys and uakaris. Most species are native to the Amazonia region of Brazil, with some being found from Colombia in the north to Bolivia in the south.  - Stirtonia is an extinct genus of New World monkey from the middle and late Miocene . Its remains have been found in South America . It is classified in Alouattini with howler monkeys .  - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.

It was a beautiful Saturday morning, and Raquel sat down at her desk with a steaming cup of coffee. She had a fresh sketchbook ready to capture her ideas and eagerly began brainstorming. Raquel realized that she not only needed to design eye-catching clothing but also had to properly position her brand in the market. It was essential to identify the target audience and understand the latest fashion trends that would resonate with customers. To do this, Raquel decided to conduct thorough market research and analyze her competitors' strategies. She would attend fashion events, talk to potential customers, and take note of what was selling well in stores. She also decided to consult with industry experts and influencers to gain their insights and advice on growing her brand. Weeks of research revealed that there was growing interest in sustainable and ethically produced clothing. Consumers were becoming more conscious of the environmental impact of their choices and actively looked for brands that shared their values. This information excited Raquel, as it aligned perfectly with her own beliefs. As she began to design her new line, Raquel made the bold decision to use only eco-friendly and sustainably-sourced materials. This meant she would have to go beyond the typical fabrics and traditional production processes. She envisioned a collection that incorporated natural fibers like organic cotton, hemp, and bamboo, as well as cutting-edge fabrics made from recycled materials. Working tirelessly on her new collection, Raquel invested in talented artisans who shared her vision of sustainable fashion and who would bring her designs to life. She treasured the partnerships she created. They worked together, experimenting with natural dyes and low-impact printing techniques, to create unique designs that reflected the new direction of her brand. Months passed, and slowly, her new collection came together. Each piece was a work of art, carefully crafted from high-quality materials that were not only eco-friendly but also visually stunning and comfortable to wear. The colors were rich and vibrant, while the textures were soft and luxurious. Raquel decided to embrace the marketing power of social media and share behind-the-scenes moments of her design process and ethical production. Her transparency and dedication to sustainable fashion resonated with many consumers, catching the attention of notable influencers and even fashion writers. To showcase her new collection, Raquel organized a fashion event at an open-air venue, setting up a runway among lush green gardens. The event was designed to be eco-friendly, with waste reduction measures like reusable decor elements and compostable tableware. Invitations were sent out to bloggers, editors, and potential customers interested in sustainable fashion. The day of the event, the sun shone brightly, adding a warm and inviting glow to the surroundings. Guests arrived, excited to see what Raquel had been working on. As the models walked down the runway, the audience was captivated by the unique designs, unexpected color combinations, and luxurious textures. The reviews from the event were overwhelmingly positive, with many people praising Raquel's dedication to creating a sustainable clothing line. Orders began rolling in, and her brand gained a reputation for being part of the global movement to make the fashion industry eco-friendly. Years later, Raquel was able to look back on the day she decided to pivot her business and see it as the turning point of her career. By choosing to embrace sustainable and ethical practices, Raquel not only built a successful clothing line that reflected her values but also became a cherished and respected figure in the industry, while inspiring countless others to follow in her footsteps."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   All crocodilians are carnivores. They feed on live animals such as birds, small mammals and fish. Crocodilians use several methods of attack when pursuing live prey. One approach is that of the ambush. The crocodilian lies motionless beneath the water's surface with only their nostrils above the water line. This keeps them concealed while they watch for prey that approaches the water's edge. The crocodilian then lunges out of the water, taking their prey by surprise and dragging it from the shoreline into deep water where the prey is killed.   Q: With a diet of live animals such as birds, small mammals and fish, all crocodilians are considered what?   A: Choose your answer from: 1). omnivores 2). symbiotes 3). predators 4). carnivores Answer:","output":"Based on the paragraph, the answer is: 4). carnivores Explanation: The paragraph explicitly states that \\"All crocodilians are carnivores,\\" meaning they exclusively consume meat from live animals such as birds, small mammals, and fish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"A HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) company is a business that specializes in the design, installation, maintenance, and repair of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in both residential and commercial buildings. These systems are essential for maintaining comfortable indoor air temperature and quality, as well as providing proper airflow and humidity control. The statement \\"For larger buildings, building services designers and engineers, such as mechanical, architectural, or building services engineers analyze, design, and specify the HVAC systems, and specialty mechanical contractors fabricate and commission them\\" is a reasonable answer within the context of larger building projects. This statement highlights the role of various professionals involved in the design and implementation of HVAC systems for large-scale commercial or industrial buildings. In such projects, building services engineers (including mechanical engineers, architectural engineers, and others with expertise in building systems) collaborate to analyze the specific needs of the building, its occupants, and environmental factors. They then design the appropriate HVAC systems that meet these needs, taking into account factors such as energy efficiency, cost, and performance. Once the design has been finalized, specialty mechanical contractors can fabricate, install, and commission the systems to ensure proper operation and functionality according to the design specifications. In some cases, HVAC companies may also provide ongoing maintenance and repair services to ensure that the systems continue to function optimally throughout their life cycle.

Article:Speaking publically for the first time since stepping down, Sir John Sawers said there could not be online \\"no-go areas\\" the government could not access. The ex-spy chief said trust between governments and internet companies had been shattered and needed rebuilding. Another UK terrorist attack \\"would get through\\" at some point, he said. Speaking at the launch of a study by public affairs firm Edelman on attitudes towards bodies like the security services, the ex-chief of the Secret Intelligence Service said it was not possible to stop terrorist attacks like those in Paris without a data-sharing agreement to allow the security agencies to monitor people's activity online. \\"Of course there is a dilemma here because the general public and politicians and the technology companies, to some extent, they want us to be able to monitor the activities of terrorists and other evil doers but they do not want their own activities to be open to any such monitoring,\\" he said. \\"If you allow areas which are completely impenetrable, then, okay, you might feel comfortable that your communications are private and no one else can see them, but so are those who are trying to do you down and undermine your society.\\" Sir John said a breakdown in trust between between internet companies and the government was the result of revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former US spy agency contractor who disclosed the extent of surveillance and electronic monitoring by US and British government agencies. \\"Snowden threw a massive rock in the pool and the ripples haven't stopped yet,\\" he said. Sir John also warned a \\"hardened core\\" of fighters returning to Britain from Iraq and Syria posed a real threat. \\"At some point these threats will get through and there will be another terrorist attack in this country,\\" he said. Sir John Sawers has spent most of the last five years hidden from the public. As the recently retired Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, more commonly known as MI6, he oversaw what he called 'a root and branch' programme of modernisation, moulding the spy agency to face 21st Century threats. He has also had to deal with allegations that, in the years immediately following the 9/11 attacks, MI6 officers were complicit in the rendition and abuse of suspected terrorists. He said these allegations needed to be taken seriously, and they are still under police investigation. Referring to MI6's partner agency, the CIA, he said they had run into problems because they became involved in \\"lethal operations\\". British intelligence agencies, he said, acted in support of the military but did not get involved in \\"kinetic operations\\" involving the use of lethal force. The former spy chief has now left government service and is poised to begin a new career in the private sector. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised laws giving greater access to online communication if he wins the May general election. Some opponents, including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, have objected to the so-called 'snoopers' charter', saying it goes too far. But Sir John, who was formerly known in Whitehall as \\"C\\", backed the prime minister's stance. He said online communication services like Facebook's WhatsApp and Apple's FaceTime could not be beyond the reach of monitoring agencies. \\"I think one benefit of the last 18 months' debate is that people now understand that is simply not possible and there has to be some form of ability to cover communications that are made through modern technology,\\" he said. Sir John was Britain's ambassador to the United Nations before being named as the head of MI6 in 2009. He stepped down from the role in November. He also spent three years as Tony Blair's foreign policy adviser. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The former Chief of the UK's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), Sir John Sawers, spoke publicly for the first time since stepping down from his position, saying that governments need access to online \\"no-go areas\\" to prevent terrorist attacks and monitor people's activity online.

He acknowledged the desire for privacy but stressed that impenetrable areas in the digital sphere could also harbor individuals seeking to cause harm and undermine society. Sawers partially attributed the breakdown in trust between internet companies and governments to Edward Snowden's whistleblowing.

Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy. Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that \\"Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke\\". An American visitor taken to Manchester's blackspots saw \\"wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments\\".The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself... A:","output":"Five new things that were happening in Manchester at the time include: 1. New industrial processes: Manchester was experiencing rapid industrial growth, particularly in the cotton industry, with the development of numerous mills and factories utilizing advanced technology for that time period.   2. New ways of thinking: The Manchester School, which advocated for free trade and laissez-faire economic policies, emerged during this period, reflecting the innovative thinking taking place within the city. 3. New classes or groups in society: As the city became a center for industrialization, various social classes and occupational groups formed, including factory workers, merchants, and artisans. 4. New religious sects: The growth and change in Manchester led to the emergence of new religious groups and sects, influenced by the diverse population in the city. 5. New forms of labor organization: The first Trades Union Congress took place in Manchester in 1868, marking the city's important role in the labor movement and the development of new methods for organizing and advocating for workers' rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Harris Allsworth (David Gurian) is their manager and Kelly's boyfriend. At the beginning of the film, Kelly gets the idea to relocate to the West Coast and look up her estranged Aunt Susan. It seems that Aunt Susan (Phyllis Davis) is holding a large inheritance that would have been shared with Kelly's mother, had she been alive. Kelly feels as if a share of this money could be hers, so the foursome sets out for Hollywood.Aunt Susan welcomes Kelly and her friends, and even promises a third of the fortune to Kelly, but Susan's sleazy financial advisor Porter Hall looks down on the girls, deeming them \\"hippies\\". Meanwhile, Susan introduces The Kelly Affair to a flamboyant and well-connected rock producer named Ronnie \\"Z-Man\\" Barzell (John LaZar), who urges the girls to give an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties. The number goes over so well that Z-Man takes the band under his wing, changing their name to The Carrie Nations, much to the chagrin of Harris.

Plot title: Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star Movie plot: Dickie Roberts is a former child star who shot to fame on a TV sitcom called The Glimmer Gang with his catchphrase \\"This is Nuckin' Futs!\\". His career subsequently halted after his 6th birthday. Since his heyday, he has been reduced to parking cars at Morton's and appearing on Celebrity Boxing, where he is matched with Emmanuel Lewis. In the public eye and to his girlfriend Cyndi who apparently leaves him during a roadside incident, Dickie is washed up. After talking to an old friend, Leif Garrett, Dickie is absolutely convinced that a new Rob Reiner movie in the works, Mr. Blake's Backyard, will be his comeback vehicle. Even after Sidney, his agent, does not land him an audition, Dickie persists. While on duty at Morton's, he joy rides in a customer's vehicle, drops into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, and he pesters Tom Arnold to hook him up with Reiner. After he is kicked out because he's not an alcoholic, Dickie fakes being wasted and crashes what turns out to be a Lamaze class. However, Brendan Fraser (in an uncredited cameo appearance) is in the class and, finding his entrance to the class hilarious and ridiculous, he agrees to help him out and calls Reiner for Dickie. Reiner bluntly tells Dickie that the part is not within his abilities because it requires knowing how a regular person lives.

The character is a founding member of the Fantastic Four. He is writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby's reinvention of a similar, previous character, the android Human Torch of the same name and powers was created in 1939 by writer-artist Carl Burgos for Marvel Comics' predecessor company, Timely Comics. Like the rest of the Fantastic Four, Jonathan \\"Johnny\\" Storm gained his powers on a spacecraft bombarded by cosmic rays. Growing up in Glenville, New York, a fictional Long Island suburban town, Johnny Storm lost his mother due to a car accident from which his father, surgeon Franklin Storm, escaped unharmed. Franklin Storm spiraled into alcoholism and financial ruin, and was imprisoned after killing a loan shark in self-defense. Johnny Storm was then raised by his older sister, Sue Storm.  At 16, Storm joined his sister and her fiance, Reed Richards, in a space flight in which cosmic radiation transformed those three and spacecraft pilot Ben Grimm into superpowered beings who would become the celebrated superhero team the Fantastic Four. Storm, with the ability to become a flaming human with the power of flight and the ability to project fire, dubs himself the Human Torch, in tribute to the World War II-era hero of that name. In The Fantastic Four #4, it is Storm who discovers an amnesiac hobo whom he helps regain his memory as the antihero Namor the Sub-Mariner, one of the three most popular heroes of Marvel Comics' 1940s forerunner, Timely Comics, returning him to modern continuity.  Though a member of a world-famous team, Storm still lived primarily in Glenville and attended Glenville High School. Here he thought he maintained a secret identity, although his fellow townsfolk were well aware of his being a member of the Fantastic Four and simply humored him. This series introduced what would become the recurring Fantastic Four foes the Wizard and Paste-Pot Pete, later known as the Trapster. In Storm's home life, Mike Snow, a member of the high-school wrestling squad, bullied Storm until an accidental flare-up of the Torch's powers scarred Snow's face. Storm dated fellow student Dorrie Evans, although she eventually grew tired of his constant disappearances and broke off their relationship. Did he have any siblings?","output":"Yes, Jonathan \\"Johnny\\" Storm, also known as the Human Torch, did have a sibling. He had an older sister named Sue Storm. Sue is a significant character in the Marvel Comics universe and is known for being a part of the Fantastic Four, the same superhero team that Johnny is part of.  Sue, like her younger brother Johnny, was exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation during a space flight with Reed Richards, who would later become her husband and the leader of the Fantastic Four known as Mr. Fantastic. This exposure to cosmic radiation gave her and the other team members their unique superpower abilities.  In Sue's case, she gained the power to create force fields and render herself invisible, leading to her superhero alias, the Invisible Woman. The Storm siblings shared a strong bond, not only due to their family ties but also because of their mutual experiences as part of the Fantastic Four. Overall, the relationship between Sue and Johnny Storm is complex and multi-faceted. They often found themselves dealing with their shared loss and family history, all while navigating their heroic duties. Throughout their many adventures, they proved to be not only powerful superheroes but also caring and protective siblings. Johnny's impulsive nature often contrasted with Sue's more reasoned approach, leading to a dynamic and evolving sibling relationship. Despite the challenges they encountered, both as ordinary individuals and as superheroes, Johnny and Sue Storm embodied resilience and perseverance, helping each other to face numerous battles and personal trials. As one half of the Fantastic Four, they represent two key pieces of this iconic superhero ensemble, further enriching the narrative landscape of the Marvel Comics universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To summarize the entire process: 1. Bees go out during the day and gather food, primarily in the form of nectar from flowers. 2. While gathering food, bees also collect small amounts of pollen which helps in the process of cross-pollination, essential for the reproduction of plants. 3. Bees convert the nectar they have gathered into honey by storing it in honeycombs and evaporating the excess water content. 4. Bees produce wax from special glands in their abdomen, which they use to build the bee hive with hexagonal cells structured together, known as the honeycomb. 5. Bees then make food called honey, created from the nectar they have gathered from flowers combined with enzymes from their saliva. They store the honey in the honeycomb cells. 6. The final step involves using a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis to maintain the integrity of the hive. Bees collect plant resins and mix it with their enzymes to produce propolis. They use it to seal cracks, strengthen the hive structure, and protect it from external threats such as bacteria and fungi. Overall, the process highlights the essential tasks bees perform in sustaining the hive, producing honey, and maintaining the health and structure of the hive through the use of propolis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The global number of confirmed cases passed 377,000 across 194 countries and territories as of 0200 GMT on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, with more than 16,500 reported deaths. Singapore, which according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) data had reported 455 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and two deaths as of March 22, has imposed some social distancing recommendations but has not closed its schools. Elsewhere, millions of children have seen their schools closed in the United States, across much of Europe and in many other countries as governments have imposed strict social lockdown measures to stop people meeting and mingling in groups. Published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, the study, conducted by researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS), looked at a simulated Singapore setting to analyze the potential impact of social distancing policies. It found that while less effective than the combined three-pronged approach, quarantine plus workplace measures presented the next best option for reducing COVID-19 cases, followed by quarantine plus school closure, and then quarantine only. “The results of this study provide policy makers in Singapore and other countries with evidence to begin the implementation of enhanced outbreak control measures that could mitigate or reduce local transmission rates if deployed effectively and in a timely manner,” said Alex R Cook, an associate professor at NUS who co-led the work.

Article: \\"Everything happens for the best,\\" my mother said whenever things weren't going my way. \\"Don't worry, one day your luck will change.\\" Mother was right, as I discovered after I had finished my college education. I had decided to try for a job in radio. One day, I wanted to host  a sports program. I went to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station. But I got turned down every time. In one station, a kind lady said my problem was that I hadn't got enough experience. \\" Get some work with a small station and work your way up,\\" she said. I went back home. I couldn't get a job there, either. Then my dad told me a businessman had opened a store and needed someone to help him. But again, I didn't get the job. I felt really down. \\" Your luck will change,\\" Mom said to me. Dad lent me the car to help me to look for my job. I tried another radio station in Iowa. But the owner, a nice man, told me he had already had someone. As I left his office, I asked, \\"How can someone be a sports announcer  if he can't get a job in a radio station?\\" I was waiting for the lift when I heard the man call. \\" What did you mean? Do you know anything about football?\\" He put me in front of a microphone and asked me to try to imagine that I was giving my opinion on a football game, I succeeded. On my way home, Mom's words came back to me, \\"One day your luck will change, Son. And when it happens, it'll feel doubly  good because of all the hard work you've had.\\" At that moment I knew what just what she meant. Question: Which of the following is true according to the article? Answer: Pick your answer from: (a). You just need wait for some time, then luck will come. (b). Luck will come if you try your best to do everything. (c). It's important for you to wait for luck. (d). You should trust your mother. Answer:","output":"(b). Luck will come if you try your best to do everything. According to the article, the protagonist experienced numerous setbacks while searching for a job in radio. Despite these challenges, they persisted in their efforts, continually seeking out new opportunities. Eventually, their luck changed when their knowledge of football and determination to find a job in radio led to an opportunity to prove their potential as a sports announcer. The protagonist's success resonates with their mother's encouraging words that their luck would change and that when it did, the rewards would feel even more satisfying due to their hard work and perseverance. Therefore, the article emphasizes the importance of putting in effort and staying resilient in order to achieve success, suggesting that luck will come to those who try their best to do everything."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Van Draylan Dixson, 39, now linked to four of a possible nine serial rapes in a south Dallas, TX., neighborhood, beat a rape charge in the early 1990s after the victim was struck by lightning. This revelation was made just as he was taken into custody Friday morning in Baton Rouge, LA. Mr Dixson was also suspected in a tenth rape in the Fair Park neighborhood, but officials appear to have moved in a different direction with that investigation.

At the end of the day we all went our separate ways, but we had been drawn close by working together to make this play. After the show was broadcast, my friends asked if I had been scared of the criminal. At first this sounded funny. He was, after all, a kind and intelligent man.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose water bottle was destroyed?  During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac. The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers.  Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws.  Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of some rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly. The sniper sees Matthews and fires, injuring Matthews in the left shoulder as he crawled towards the wall, but a second shot kills him.

Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect.

She did not like her ugly colour. She was attracted by the colour of the lake near her home. It was as blue as the sky after a storm. Bluebird wanted to be the colour of that beautiful lake very much. Flapping her wings one morning, Bluebird flew from her tree to the blue lake. Then she bathed in the water three times. After each bath, she sang, \\"Blue water. Still water. I went in. I am blue.\\" Bluebird repeated this every morning. On the third day, she came out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Now Coyote was a trickster --and hungry too. He stayed behind Bluebird's tree for a long time every day and watched her go to the lake. He pretended  to be interested in everything she did. He wanted Bluebird for lunch, but he was afraid of the blue water. On the third morning, Coyote saw Bluebird come out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Impressed, he sat next to Bluebird's tree and waited for her. When she returned, he asked, \\"How did you get blue feathers? I want to be blue like the mountains too.\\" Bluebird didn't believe Coyote, but she taught him how to bathe three times each morning and how to sing her song. Coyote did what she said, and after three days of bathing in the lake, his white fur turned deep blue. Convinced  that blue fur was even more beautiful than blue feathers, Coyote forgot all about being hungry. He ran as fast as he could to the top of the hill. Standing on his back legs, he raised his front legs off the ground and howled. But Coyote slipped  and rolled down the hill. He couldn't stop himself, and the dust and dirt covered his new blue fur.

Which parcel had fewer plants with large and feathery stigma?  Frank owned two parcels of land. He called them Forest and Field. The Forest parcel was covered in old-growth pine, while Field one was covered in grass and wildflowers. Frank was very proud of his properties.  Hint: Anemophilous pollen grains are light and non-sticky, so that they can be transported by air currents. They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.

Question: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Fire sweeps clothing factory in Bangladesh -- more than 100 killed Bangladeshi firefighters battle a fire at a garment factory in the Savar neighborhood in Dhaka, Bangladesh, late Saturday. By NBC News wire services Updated at 3:25 p.m. ET: DHAKA, Bangladesh -- At least 112 people were killed in a fire that raced through a multi-story garment factory just outside of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, an official said Sunday. The blaze broke out late Saturday at the eight-story factory operated by Tazreen Fashions Ltd., a subsidiary of the Tuba Group, which supplies Walmart and other major retailers in the U.S. and Europe. By Sunday morning, firefighters had recovered 100 bodies, fire department Operations Director Maj. Mohammad Mahbub told The Associated Press. He said another 12 people who had suffered injuries after jumping from the building to escape the fire later died at hospitals. The death toll could rise as the search for victims was continuing, he said. Local media reported that up to 124 people were killed in the fire. The cause of the blaze was not immediately clear, and authorities have ordered an investigation. Army soldiers and paramilitary border guards were deployed to help police keep the situation under control as thousands of onlookers and anxious relatives of the factory workers gathered at the scene, Mahbub said. He would not say how many people were still missing. Working conditions at Bangladeshi factories are notoriously poor, with little enforcement of safety laws, and overcrowding and locked fire doors are common. The cause of this fire was not immediately known. Tazreen was given a \\"high risk\\" safety rating after May 16, 2011, audit conducted by an ethical sourcing assessor for Wal-Mart, according to a document posted on the Tuba Group's website. It did not specify the conditions or violations that led to the rating. A spokesman for Wal-Mart said online documents indicating that the factory received an orange or \\"high risk\\" assessment after the May 2011 inspection and a yellow or \\"medium risk\\" report after an inspection in August 2011 appeared to pertain to the factory where the fire occurred. The August 2011 letter said Wal-Mart would conduct another inspection within one year. Spokesman Kevin Gardner said it was not clear if that inspection had been conducted, or if the factory was still making products for Wal-Mart. If a factory is rated \\"orange\\" three times in a two-year period, Wal-Mart won't place any orders for one year. The May 2011 report was the first orange rating for the factory. There was no indication whether the violations had been fixed since the May inspection. Neither Tazreen's owner nor Tuba Group officials could be reached for comment. The Tuba Group is a major Bangladeshi garment exporter whose clients include Walmart, Carrefour and IKEA, according to its website. Its factories export garments to the U.S., Germany, France, Italy and The Netherlands, among other countries. The Tazreen factory, opened in 2009 and employing about 1,700 people, makes polo shirts, fleece jackets and T-shirts. Bangladesh has some 4,000 garment factories, many without proper safety measures. The country annually earns about 20 billion from exports of garment products, mainly to the United States and Europe. In its 2012 Global Responsibility report, Walmart said that \\"fire safety continues to be a key focus for brands and retailers sourcing from Bangladesh.\\" Walmart said it ceased working with 49 factories in Bangladesh in 2011 due to fire safety issues, and was working with its supplier factories to phase out production from buildings deemed high risk. At the factory scene, relatives of the workers were frantically looking for their loved ones. Sabina Yasmine said she saw the body of her daughter-in-law, who died in the fire, but had no trace of her son, who also worked at the factory. \\"Oh, Allah, where's my soul? Where's my son?\\" wailed Yasmine, who works at another factory in the area. \\"I want the factory owner to be hanged. For him, many have died, many have gone.\\" Mahbub said firefighters recovered 69 bodies from the second floor of the factory alone. He said most of the victims had been trapped inside the factory, located just outside of Dhaka, with no emergency exits leading outside the building. Many workers who had taken shelter on the roof of the factory were rescued, but firefighters were unable to save those who were trapped inside, Mahbub said. He said the fire broke out on the ground floor, which was used as a warehouse, and spread quickly to the upper floors. \\"The factory had three staircases, and all of them were down through the ground floor,\\" Mahbub said. \\"So the workers could not come out when the fire engulfed the building.\\" \\"Had there been at least one emergency exit through outside the factory, the casualties would have been much lower,\\" he said. Many of the victims were burned beyond recognition. The recovered bodies were kept in rows on the premise of a nearby school. Meanwhile, many of the bodies were handed over to families but at least 60 bodies remained unidentified till late Sunday, said police official Moshiuddoula, who uses one name. The unclaimed bodies were later taken to Dhaka Medical College where the corpses will be kept until Monday morning for identification. Otherwise, the bodies will be handed over to a charity organization, Anjuman-e-Mufidul Islam, for burial, said local chief government administrator Sheikh Yusuf Harun. The charity group is a voluntary organization which buries unclaimed bodies. By late Sunday, firefighters had concluded their search and left the scene, the fire department's control room duty officer Bhajan Sarker told The Associated Press by phone. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expressed shock at the loss of so many lives in the blaze and asked authorities to conduct thorough search-and-rescue operations. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association said it would stand by the victims' families. Separately, a flyover under construction fell onto a busy market, leaving at least 14 people dead including three construction workers in southeastern city of Chittagong, an official said Sunday. Local fire official Abdul Mannan said the concrete structure collapsed on Saturday night, and authorities recovered the bodies by Sunday morning from under the debris in the second-largest city after Dhaka.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Kreider, Lundqvist end Rangers' skid with 3-2 win over Jets WINNIPEG — Oh, to be King for a day — again. Henrik Lundqvist made 32 saves Tuesday night for his first win since returning from a seven-week injury absence, topping the Winnipeg Jets, 3-2, to snap a two-game team losing streak and push the Rangers back on top of the Eastern Conference. “I felt so much better than the last game,” Lundqvist said, citing Saturday’s 4-2 loss in Boston, his first start since being cleared to play. “Just my focus and being more comfortable, it’s night and day.” RELATED: RANGERS' MARTIN ST. LOUIS INTENDS TO PLAY THURSDAY IN MINNESOTA The Rangers (48-21-7, 103 points) struggled through several tough stretches but worked hard and got goals from Mats Zuccarello (goal, assist), Derick Brassard (goal, assist) on the power play and Chris Kreider on a blazing third-period rush to snap a 2-2 tie for the win at 16:14. “Usually I stay wide there,” Kreider said of darting into the middle to receive new linemate J.T. Miller’s feed at the blue line. “For whatever reason, I thought it would be a better option to dart across, and (Miller) made a great pass. My job was easy.” Defenseman Dan Girardi was credited with 10 blocked shots, a Ranger record since the NHL began tracking the statistic in 2005-06. Captain Ryan McDonagh (assist) laughed out loud when told of Girardi’s total. “He’s the master of blocking shots,” McDonagh said. Lundqvist won for the first time since making 33 saves in a 6-3 home win over the Florida Panthers on Feb. 2, before he was sidelined with a partially torn blood vessel in his neck. He truly looked like himself when Jets defenseman Dustin Byfuglien hammered one of the NHL’s hardest slap shots off the goalie’s helmet 11:23 into the third period, and he didn’t flinch. “I’m happy the mask worked,” Lundqvist said with a smile of the charity helmet crafted with the help of his fairly competitive friend, tennis legend John McEnroe. RELATED: CROSS-CHECK TO J.T. MILLER INFURIATES ALAIN VIGNEAULT Lundqvist was extremely patient, waiting for Jets shooters to make every first move. It made him look more stationary than usual but it was an effective, conscious strategy. “I corrected a couple things,” Lundqvist said. “Less movement is something we talked about after the first game, just to try to do a little less, not challenge too much. I felt like my timing was a lot better.” McDonagh said the win was important not only for Lundqvist but for the team, which had lost three of its last four coming in. Like Saturday in Boston, the Rangers again put Lundqvist in a hole early, surrendering the first nine shots to Winnipeg. They fell behind 1-0 and 2-1 on goals by Jets forwards Jim Slater in the first period and ex-Ranger Lee Stempniak in the second. But they rallied to hand the Jets (39-26-12, 90 points) a big loss as Winnipeg fights for a playoff spot in the West, while furthering their own hopes to lock up postseason home ice. They have six regular-season games remaining, beginning with Thursday night’s conclusion to this two-game road trip in Minnesota. “This last several games we weren’t really giving ourselves a chance,” McDonagh said. “But tonight with our battles, compete level, we were working hard all over the ice. “It might not have been pretty at times. We were pinned in our zone at times, but we did a great job of sticking with our structure and found a way to put the puck in the net.” Summary:","output":"In their recent match, the New York Rangers managed to secure a 3-2 win against the Winnipeg Jets. The Rangers broke their two-game losing streak, with Henrik Lundqvist making 32 saves for his first win since a seven-week injury absence. Mats Zuccarello, Derick Brassard, and Chris Kreider each scored goals to help the Rangers get back on track. This win was essential for Lundqvist and the team as they push for the Eastern Conference lead and playoff positioning with six regular-season games remaining."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor. PUBLISHED:. 04:29 EST, 5 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:34 EST, 5 June 2013. Tax havens which allow the mega-rich to hide their wealth from the UK taxman have been summoned to London to explain themselves. David Cameron has warned Britain's overseas territories and crown dependencies that he is determined to tackle the ‘scourge of tax evasion’ which costs Britain billions. Senior ministers from 10 territories including Jersey, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands have been invited to a meeting this month where they will be urged to sign up to greater tax transparency. Scourge: David Cameron, pictured walking to Parliament today, has summoned ministers from British territories to a tax summit this month. Mr Cameron has made the tax avoidance and evasion a priority of the G8 summit which he is hosting in Northern Ireland on June 17 and 18. He has warned overseas territories of the need to ‘get our own houses in order’ and will attend the Open for Growth conference on the weekend before the G8 summit opens. Senior ministers from Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Anguilla, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man are expected to attend. Some of the islands and outposts are widely regarded as offshore tax havens, though they dispute this description and regard their low-tax regimes as vital to their economies. There is said to be disagreement in Whitehall about how much pressure to put on the islands, fearing excessive demands from London could lead to them refusing to co-operate. Mr Cameron is examining the idea of getting the tax havens to sign up to an OECD convention on the sharing of information on tax between countries, which is seen as a key to tackling evasion. Last month he wrote to the British overseas territories warning them that he had made ‘fighting the scourge of tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance’ a priority for the G8 summit. Haven: A total of 10 overseas territories and crown dependencies, including Gibraltar, have been told to 'get their own houses in order' Summit: Ministers from the Cayman Islands (left) and Bermuda have been urged by Mr Cameron to ensure tax transparency ahead of the talks in London this month. He added: ‘I am looking to all the overseas territories and crown dependencies to continue to work in partnership with the UK in taking the lead on two critical issues: tax information exchange and beneficial ownership. ‘I respect your right to be lower tax jurisdictions. I believe passionately in lower taxes as a vital driver of growth and prosperity for all. ‘But lower taxes are only sustainable if what is owed is actually paid - and if the rules to achieve this are set and enforced fairly to create a level playing field right across the world. ‘There is no point in dealing with tax evasion in one country if the problem is simply displaced to another.'' A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We strongly welcome the overseas territories' positive engagement with our G8 presidency agenda on tax transparency and the significant progress they have made in this area. ‘We look forward to welcoming them to our G8 Open for Growth event in the run-up to the G8 leaders' summit and will continue to work with them and others to agree commitments to advance trade, ensure tax compliance and promote greater transparency.’ Last month Mr Cameron hailed a breakthrough in talks to secure an Europe-wide deal on sharing information to stop multi-national firms avoiding paying tax. The Prime Minister said European Union agreement had been reached on tackling tax evasion and avoidance, after warning countries face 'staggering' losses.

He brings two likely explanations for the change in Mishnaic times: first, the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures (Kil'ayim). Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally. Second, the Tannaim may have been influenced by Roman law, which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, offspring would follow the mother. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, offspring would follow the father?","output":"It is challenging to pinpoint an exact source or reasoning that dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, offspring would follow the father. However, here is a possible explanation based on historical and cultural factors: In many ancient societies, the patriarchal system was the prevalent norm. Men often held primary power and authority, particularly when it came to lineage and succession. As a result, children would usually be recognized through the father's line, and their legal and social status would follow that of their father. In patrilineal societies, the father would be responsible for the financial support, protection, and social status of his children, so it would have made sense that children would be connected to their father's family lineage. However, this system may not have been applicable in cases where a legal marriage could not be contracted. In those instances, children would likely follow their mother's lineage, ensuring their affiliation and connection to a family group for social and legal reasons. Besides the general trend of patriarchal systems in ancient societies, it is essential to note that there might have been specific cultural, social, or legal factors that dictated lineage rules in various communities. These factors could have influenced individual societies to follow different lineage rules or make exceptions in particular cases. In the example of the Tannaim potentially being influenced by Roman law, the matrilineal transmission of offspring might have been adopted due to its compatibility with Roman legal principles, which were dominant at that time. In conclusion, there doesn't seem to be a specific source that dictated that offspring would follow the father when a parent could not contract a legal marriage. Nevertheless, it is essential to consider historical and cultural factors, including the patriarchal system in ancient societies, which could have played a role in the development of these lineage rules."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research.

Finding ways to protect the earth's wildlife and conserve the natural world they inhabit is now more important than ever.  Dodo The Dodo is a classic example of how human caused damage to the earth's biology. The flightless Dodo was native to the Island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It lived off fruit fallen from the island's trees and lived unthreatened until humans arrived in 1505. The easily controlled bird became a source of food for sailors and was attacked by animals introduced to the island by humans such as pigs, monkeys and rats. The population of Dodos rapidly decreased and last one was killed in 1681.  Rhinos The Rhino horn is a highly priced item for Asian medicine. This has led to the animal being hunted in its natural habitat. Once widespread in Africa and Eurasia, most rhinos now live in protected natural parks and reserves . Their numbers have rapidly decreased in the last 50 years, and the animals remain under constant threat from poachers .  The Giant Panda The future of the World Wildlife Fund's symbol is far from certain. As few as 1000 remain in the wild. The Chinese government has set up 33 panda reserves to protect these beautiful animals and made poaching them punishable with 20 years in prison.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: This is a natural substance that contains silica and other trace elements, and when taken correctly, it can kill mature parasites, larvae, and eggs. Additionally, it can also help improve your overall digestive health.  Only use food-safe diatomaceous earth. Other varieties can be harmful if ingested. Typically, you'll need to start by dissolving 1 tsp (5 ml) of the powdered supplement into 8 oz (250 ml) of water. Drink this solution once daily. If necessary, you could gradually increase the amount to 1 or 2 Tbsp (15 or 30 ml) if the infection persists for several weeks. The B-vitamins in apple cider vinegar can help nourish the body as it fights against infection, and its acidic pH can help neutralize the pH of the body while improving digestive health.  Start by taking 1 tsp (5 ml) of apple cider vinegar up to three times daily. Taking it 30 minutes before each meal can improve your body's ability to absorb it. If you handle the initial dosage well, you might be able to gradually increase it to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) instead of 1 tsp (5 ml). Certain herbs and spices are believed to help strengthen the body and combat invading parasites. You can take most in the form of capsules, powders, and teas.  Herbs commonly used against parasites include barberry, goldenseal, Oregon grape, anise, wormwood, curled mint, and black walnuts. Similarly, cinnamon is one spice that may have anti-parasitic properties. Season your dishes with cinnamon or drink a solution made with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of cinnamon and 8 oz (250 ml) of water up to three times daily. Note that some herbs may have toxic side effects when taken for prolonged periods, and others can negatively interfere with other medications. Thoroughly research any herb before taking it medicinally. In particular, both coconut oil and olive oil may help your body get rid of intestinal parasites.  Cook your meals with either oil instead of using butter, margarine, or other cooking oils. To aid your body as it fights the infection, consider taking either oil supplementally, as well. Dissolve up to 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of coconut oil into hot tea. Toss 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of olive oil with any vegetables you consume or drink it straight. Dissolve 1/2 cup (125 ml) of Epsom salts in a full bathtub of hot water. Soak in the water for 15 to 20 minutes. While the salt bath may not kill the actual parasites, it can help remove the toxins left behind by those parasites, which helps your body's ability to fight the infestation. The salt water draws these toxins out of your body through the pores of your skin. Neem tree oil is an old anti-parasitic folk remedy originating in India, and you can take it as a capsule or tea. It kills parasites and flushes out the toxins left by dying parasites, and it may also help restore the health of your liver after infection.  Follow the dosage instructions that come with the supplement. Precise dosage will vary depending on the severity of your infection, your age, and your overall health. It's best to talk to a healthcare provider before taking this supplement to avoid the risk of complication. Note that neem is not safe for women who are pregnant or nursing since it could severely hurt or kill the baby. It can also be toxic to young children. As you eliminate parasites from your intestines, you may experience severe bodily discomfort and abdominal pain. Going through the treatment at a fast pace will increase this discomfort.  If you're receiving treatment under the guidance of your physician, follow the schedule set by your doctor to ensure the maximum benefit. When you're primarily relying on home treatment, you should try to stretch it out over the course of several weeks. Maintain an anti-parasitic diet for a few weeks before introducing some of the supplemental treatments (apple cider vinegar, diatomaceous earth, neem oil, etc.) into your system.","output":"This article talks about using natural substances and methods, like special earth, apple cider vinegar, herbs, oils, and baths, to help get rid of parasites and make your tummy feel better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Sure, the Finnish sentence you've provided translates to English as: \\"Dear Commissioner, thank you for your reply.\\"  Let's break down the sentence: - \\"Arvoisa\\" translates to \\"Dear\\" or \\"Honorable\\". It’s a polite form of address in Finnish and commonly used in formal context. - \\"Komission jäsen\\" is \\"Commissioner\\". A commissioner refers to a person in an official position of responsibility. - \\"Kiitos\\" is \\"thank you\\". This is an expression of gratitude in Finnish. - \\"Vastauksestanne\\" means \\"for your reply\\". This is a kind of possessive form of the noun \\"vastaus\\" (reply), with a suffix \\"-stanne\\" specifying it’s \\"your reply\\".

I was a little apprehensive about coming here with my dinner group since I had never been here before and the menu prices were somewhat cheap but it was recommended so I took a chance and made reservations.    Not being a lover of prime rib I ordered the NY strip steak, medium on the inside, charred on the outside and that's exactly how it was served to me.  The steak was intensly flavored, juicy and very  tender.  I was impressed.     Bertha ordered liver and onions and said it was one of the best she'd ever had, tons of onions and bacon.   Sandy had the beef medalions with a sauce to die for and she too liked it very much. Maureen loved her strip steak and remarked at how perfectly is was done, (medium rare). Jeannette was the only one who ordered the prime rib although she was afraid there would be a lot of fat as most prime rib cuts can be.  Not so with this one.  We were surprised at how well it was trimmed and she commented on on well it was prepared.    Baked potatoes all around, separate dish, loads of butter and sour cream on the side.    The salads were fresh, crisp and ample.   My Caesar had a tad too much dressing but didn't stop me from finishing it.   Maureen raved about her blue cheese dressing so naturally we all had to dip our forks into the pitcher and give it a taste.  She was right, it was some of the best blue cheese ever with chunks of cheese.  The price for my steak was  21.95 with soup, or salad, and potato.   A bargain I thought.

Service was wonderful, we never had to ask for anything; one of the two servers we had was always aware that water needed filling, wine glasses needed re-filling, plates needed to be taken away, etc.     Ambience was very nice, somewhat quiet,  cozy and very comfortable chairs.

Given the context provided, we can infer that Alex is feeling loved for a number of reasons. Firstly, the very act of permitting their parents to enter the building suggests a welcoming gesture, indicative of the warmth and affection existing between Alex and their parents. Additionally, engaging in a \\"nice long chat\\" implies they are comfortable with one another and enjoy each other's company.  It's important to note that the other answer choices can be ruled out. Describing Alex as feeling bored would not make sense in the context, as a long, pleasant conversation suggests genuine interest and engagement in the discussion. The term \\"nice\\" further implies that the chat was positive, making it unlikely that Alex was feeling bored during their conversation. As for feeling passive, it's not an accurate description either, considering that Alex took the initiative to allow their parents to enter the building and engage in a meaningful conversation with them, demonstrating an active role in fostering their relationship.

But a statement filed in court by the FBI gave the first detailed account of how the shootings unfolded. According to the FBI, Ciancia entered the airport’s Terminal 3 about 9:20 a.m. and approached the security checkpoint. Pulling a Smith & Wesson .223-caliber M&P-15 assault rifle from his bag, he fired multiple times at point-blank range at Hernandez, who was on duty and in uniform, leaving the screener wounded. Then, after starting up an escalator, Ciancia looked back at Hernandez, who appeared to move. Ciancia then went back to shoot him again. the statement said.Hernandez was fatally wounded. Ciancia then shot at “at least” two more TSA employees and one airline passenger, wounding all three, before two pursuing Los Angeles Airport Police officers wounded him, the FBI said. In a bag that Ciancia had at the airport, the FBI said, other law enforcement officers found a handwritten letter, signed by the suspect, saying that he had “made the conscious decision to try to kill” TSA employees. Ciancia’s possessions at the scene “included five magazine clips” of ammunition. Ciancia was taken to a hospital; an FBI spokesman said no information about his condition was being released Saturday night. The gunfire sent panic through the nation’s third-busiest airport and disrupted air traffic there along with the travel plans of thousands of would-be passengers throughout the nation. The airport was fully reopened on Saturday afternoon, authorities said. On Saturday, Hernandez’s wife spoke to reporters outside her Los Angeles area home, describing him as a “wonderful husband, father, brother, son and friend.” She said her husband, who was about to turn 40, had come to the United States at age 15 from El Salvador and “took pride in his duty for the American public.” Still unclear Saturday was what had led Ciancia to make the TSA his alleged target, but there were signs of psychological trouble. According to an account from police in the New Jersey town where he grew up, Ciancia had sent a text message to his brother indicating that he might harm himself. The message had aroused enough concern to prompt his father on Friday to get authorities to check on him in Los Angeles, where he was living. “I understand that they tried to reach him,” said a neighbor of Ciancia’s father in New Jersey, “but they missed him.” The incident also raised questions about airport security and the possible mixture of mental illness and weapons, as well as about Ciancia’s state of mind.","output":"The FBI has charged a suspect, Ciancia, with murder following a shooting incident at Los Angeles Airport (LAX), however, his motives towards the Transport Security Administration (TSA) remain unclear. The FBI detailed that Ciancia approached a security checkpoint in LAX's Terminal 3, pulled out an assault rifle from his bag, and fired at point-blank range multiple times at Hernandez, a uniformed TSA staff member who was on duty. Thinking Hernandez was still alive, Ciancia went back to shoot him again. He then shot at two more TSA employees and one passenger, before being wounded by two pursuing airport police officers. In a subsequent search, the law enforcement officers discovered a handwritten letter in Ciancia's bag purporting his decision to take the lives of TSA employees and found that he had additional ammunition clips with him. With no current update given on Ciancia's medical condition, the incident has caused widespread panic, affecting air traffic and travel plans extensively. The airport was fully reopened the following afternoon.  Hernandez, who had immigrated to the United States from El Salvador at age 15, was beloved by his family and was about to turn 40. Ciancia's motivation for the shooting remains a mystery, but there are indications of psychological instability. Prior to the incident, he had sent a troubling text message to his brother, suggesting self-harm which prompted his father to request a welfare check by the authorities in Los Angeles, where Ciancia was residing.  This tragic incident has reignited debates over airport security, availability of weapons, and considerations about mental health.

MyNoise is another great source of relaxing music that can help you center yourself and find some inner peace. Going for a walk or run is another good way to calm yourself down. Getting exercise not only tires us out and lets us release tension, it also releases endorphins, which are the brain chemical that regulates our emotions. Go for a quick jog around the block if you find you're having a hard time. Whether you're playing fetch with a dog or pirates with a five-year-old, having fun with someone who really knows how to embrace the joys of life can make a huge difference when you're having a tough time. Drama, either drama you cause or drama you find yourself in the middle of, can really get in the way of finding your inner peace. We tend to seek out drama because it makes life more exciting, but in order to find peace we have to make our lives more exciting by pursuing challenges instead. This is because the negative feelings associated with drama cannot create inner peace, which relies on positive feelings. If someone in your life is prone to just bringing the drama, try to cut them out as much as you can. There are lots of great, basic comfort activities that you can do to calm down and find peace when you're starting to get a bit on edge.

His struggles developed in him sympathy for the working class and a lasting dislike of hard work and provided inspiration for his career as a writer. London grew up in San Francisco in extreme poverty. At an early age, he left school and supported himself through a succession of un skilled jobs ----working as a paper boy, in bowling alleys, on ice wagons, and in canneries  and mills. Despite working long hours at these jobs, London was able to read constantly, borrowing travel and adventure books from the library. The books London read inspired him to travel, and his job experiences led him to become active in fighting for the fights of workers. He sailed to Japan on a journey aiming at catching seals and joined a cross-country protest march with a group of unemployed workers. After being arrested for vagrancy near Buffalo, New York, London decided to educate himself and reshape his life. He quickly completed high school and entered the University of California. After only one term, however, the appeal of fortune and adventure proved uncontrollable. London gave up his studies and traveled to the Alaskan Yukon in 1897 in search of gold. Jack London was among the first of these miners. He may have searched for more than gold, however. London once commented, \\" True, the new region was mostly poor; but its several hundred thousand square miles of coldness at least gave breathing space to those who else would have choked at home.\\" Although he was unsuccessful as a miner, London's experiences in Alaska taught him about the human desire for wealth and power and about humankind's inability to control the forces of nature. While in Alaska, London also absorbed memories and stories that would make him known one hundred years later. Once back in California, London became determined to earn a living as a writer.

Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Who had an ancient model of humanism?\\" is in \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\".

The Falcons beat the Steelers in overtime, 41-38. The Falcons recovered a Steelers fumble after they punted to start the game. On the next play Michael Vick hit Alge Crumpler for a 22-yard touchdown pass. It was the first of what would be a career-high four touchdown pass game for Vick. After Steelers' kicker Jeff Reed kicked a 28-yard, the Steelers' defense held and forced the Falcons to give up the ball again when Steelers' safety Troy Polamalu intercepted Vick. Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger hit Georgia native and Steelers' receiver Hines Ward for an 11-yard touchdown pass to give the Steelers a 10-7 lead after one quarter of play. On the next Steelers' drive, Ben Roethlisberger found Heath Miller for a 1-yard touchdown pass to give the Steelers a 17-7 lead. The Steelers then fumbled on the first play of their following drive and the Falcons took over. Six plays later Vick found Crumpler again, this time for a 3-yard touchdown pass to cut the Steelers' lead to 17-14. The teams exchanged touchdowns and the Steelers led at halftime, 24-21. The first score of the second half came after another Steelers fumble when Warrick Dunn scored on a 3-yard touchdown run to put the Falcons ahead for the second time in the game, 28-24. Steelers' backup quarterback Charlie Batch, who came in for an injured Roethlisberger, hit Ward for a 70-yard touchdown pass to give the Steelers a 31-28 lead. The Falcons answered when Vick found Crumpler for a third time in the game with a 31-yard touchdown pass that put the Falcons ahead, 35-31. After the Falcons' Morten Andersen kicked a 25-yard field goal to give the Falcons a 38-31 lead, the Steelers came back again with a Batch 17-yard touchdown pass to tie the game at 38 and force overtime. In overtime the Falcons won the coin toss.

Article: Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill may play totally inept undercover cops in 21 Jump Street, but at the box office, they’re proving much more effective. The R-rated comedy scored a tremendous 35 million in its opening weekend, enough to easily top the chart.      21 Jump Street opened in the same range as films like Bad Teacher (31.6 million), Superbad (33.1 million), Wedding Crashers (33.9 million), and Scary Movie (42.3 million), but each of those films opened in the summer, when R-rated fare like The Hangover and Bridesmaids has traditionally captured raunch-loving audiences. For 21 Jump Street to earn 35 million over a weekend in mid-March is a far more impressive achievement. Indeed, only one R-rated comedy has ever debuted to higher numbers outside the summer season: Jackass 3-D, which started with 50.4 million in October 2010. 21 Jump Street also opened higher than fellow TV adaptations Starsky and Hutch (28.1 million), The Dukes of Hazzard (30.7 million), and Miami Vice (25.7 million).      The strong debut marks a return-to-form for star Jonah Hill, whose live-action comedic catalog seemed less impressive after unremarkable box office performances from The Sitter (30.4 million total) and Get Him to the Greek (61 million), and a slew of more dramatic roles in Cyrus, Moneyball, and Funny People. 21 Jump Street finally delivered on the expectations set up by Hill’s breakout role in Superbad, which earned 121.5 million total in 2007. Channing Tatum, meanwhile, scored his second straight hit after The Vow, which has a running total of 121.1 million. These numbers bode well for his next two releases, G.I. Joe: Retaliation and Magic Mike, both out in June. Sony and MGM, who have a potential juggernaut franchise on their hands, spent a sensible 42 million on 21 Jump Street, which earned a “B” CinemaScore grade from polled audiences.      In second place, Universal’s smash animated hit The Lorax dipped 41 percent in its third weekend to 22.8 million. After 17 days, the 3D film has found an impressive 158.4 million, already more than the last Dr Seuss adaptation, Horton Hears a Who, which grossed 154.5 million total in 2008. Also impressive is the film’s per theater average, which remains a robust 6,049, even in its third weekend 3-D ticket prices are certainly helping). Considering The Lorax, which cost 70 million to produce, is headed for a final domestic gross right around 200 million, it’s no surprise that Universal and Illumination Entertainment are now getting to work on an animated version of The Cat in the Hat.      Disney’s expensive misfire John Carter dropped by 55 percent in its sophomore frame to third place and 13.5 million. The 250 million project has now earned 53.2 million after ten days, and if it continues to play like a frontloaded fanboy flick (and it will), it will finish its run around 80 million. International receipts will need to be utterly gargantuan to save the Edgar Rice Borroughs adaptation — it’s taken in 126.1 million overseas so far.      Project X and A Thousand Words came in fourth and fifth place, respectively. Project X fell 64 percent to 4 million, giving the party flick a total of 48.1 million against a 15 million budget. Eddie Murphy’s A Thousand Words dropped by a slim 39 percent to 3.8 million, for a two-weekend total of 12.1 million. The 40 million comedy will join the ranks of Imagine That (16.1 million) and Meet Dave (11.8 million) as major Eddie Murphy bombs.      Over on the limited release front, Will Ferrell comedy Casa De Mi Padre proved to be the most caliente smaller title, drawing in 2.2 million from just 382 locations, enough for a sturdy per theater average of 5,759. Friends With Kids, meanwhile dipped by 26 percent to 1.5 million despite expanding from 369 to 641 theaters. Jason Segel/Ed Helms collaboration Jeff, Who Lives at Home proved less appealing, earning 840,000 from 254 theaters, though that was way better than Nicholas Cage thriller Seeking Justice, which found 260,000 from 231 theaters. Perhaps a direct-to-DVD run would have been a better option.      1. 21 Jump Street – 35.0 million      2. The Lorax – 22.8 mil      3. John Carter – 13.5 mil      4. Project X – 4.0 mil      5. A Thousand Words – 3.8 mil      Next weekend, a little movie called The Hunger Games is coming out, and with some of the best tracking numbers ever seen a week before release, the hugely anticipated adaptation will likely score one of the best opening weekend’s of the year — maybe ever.

The film, starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as two cops who go back to high school on an undercover mission, collected a healthy 35 million, according to distributor Sony Pictures.      \\"21 Jump Street\\" was the only film to hit theaters nationwide this weekend, though two new comedies debuted in about 60 of the country's top markets. \\"Casa de Mi Padre,\\" a Spanish-language spaghetti-western spoof featuring Will Ferrell, raked in a solid 2.2 million. Playing in 100 fewer theaters, \\"Jeff, Who Lives at Home,\\" starring Jason Segel as an idealistic thirtysomething still living in his mother's basement, grossed a so-so 840,000.      PHOTOS: Box office top ten      \\"21 Jump Street\\" appealed to both genders in nearly equal measure, and all ages went to see it as well: Half of the crowd was under the age of 25, and half was over. However, it played far better with the younger audience, who assigned it an average grade of A, according to market research firm CinemaScore. Those age 50 and over gave the movie a C-, so the movie ended up with a B overall.      Co-financed by Sony and MGM for about 42 million, \\"21 Jump Street\\" has earned strong critical reviews and was well-receieved upon its premiere at the South by SouthWest festival in Austin, Texas earlier this week.      Loosely based on the '80s television series starring a young Johnny Depp, the film marked a return to comedy for Hill, who this year earned an Oscar nomination for his supporting role in the baseball drama \\"Moneyball.\\" It's also the second box office success of the year for Tatum, the heartthrob who propelled the romantic tear-jerker \\"The Vow\\" to over 100 million worth of ticket sales in February.      Meanwhile, Ferrell developed \\"Casa de Mi Padre\\" through his Gary Sanchez Productions. In the low-budget flick, financed by Nala Films for 6 million, the actor plays a Mexican rancher's son who becomes involved in a drug war. The film debuted in 382 locations this weekend, for a per-theater average of 5,759.      The movie is being released by Pantelion Films, Lionsgate's co-venture with Mexican media company Televisa. Since its inception in 2010, Pantelion has struggled to find success at the box office. \\"Casa de Mi Padre\\" will likely prove to be its biggest suggest, which to date is last year's 3-million grossing \\"From Prada to Nada.\\"      \\"Jeff, Who Lives at Home,\\" co-starring Ed Helms and Susan Sarandon, played in 254 theaters this weekend and ended up with a per-location total of 3,300. The low-budget movie was co-funded by Paramount's specialty label Vantage and independent production-financing company Indian Paintbrush.      The film has the potential to become the biggest hit yet for filmmaking brother team Mark and Jay Duplass. After beginning their career with a series of \\"mumblecore\\" films -- ultra-inexpensive, documentary-style movies centered around naturalistic dialogue -- the brothers made their first studio project in 2010 with Fox Searchlight. That film, \\"Cyrus,\\" starring Hill and John C. Reilly, only grossed 7.5 million at the box office by the end of its run.      [Updated, 12:38 p.m. March 18: It was another bad weekend for \\"John Carter.\\" After debuting with a lackluster 30.2 million last weekend, the 250-million-plus fantasy epic saw its ticket sales fall 55% to 13.5 million. In total, the film has now grossed 53.2 million since its domestic release 10 days ago. At this rate, it seems that word-of-mouth will not be strong enough to turn the film into a domestic success, given its gargantuan budget.      Here are the top 10 movies at the domestic office, with international results when available, according to studio estimates: |||||Summary:","output":"The R-rated comedy \\"21 Jump Street,\\" starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, earned an impressive 35 million on its opening weekend, topping the box office charts. The film's success is notable as it opened in mid-March, a period when R-rated comedies typically don't perform as well as during the summer. The movie's strong debut marks a return to form for Hill, whose recent box office performances have been unremarkable.

On December 4, as news came in about the discoveries in Jordan, National Security Council (NSC) Counterterrorism Coordinator Richard Clarke wrote Berger, \\"If George's [Tenet's] story about a planned series of UBL attacks at the Millennium is true, we will need to make some decisions NOW.\\" He told us he held several conversations with President Clinton during the crisis. He suggested threatening reprisals against the Taliban in Afghanistan in the event of any attacks on U.S. interests, anywhere, by  Bin Laden. He further proposed to Berger that a strike be made during the last week of 1999 against al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan-a proposal not adopted. Warned by the CIA that the disrupted Jordanian plot was probably part of a larger series of attacks intended for the millennium, some possibly involving chemical weapons, the Principals Committee met on the night of December 8 and decided to task Clarke's Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) to develop plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda plots. Michael Sheehan, the State Department member of the CSG, communicated warnings to the Taliban that they would be held responsible for future al Qaeda attacks.\\" Mike was not diplomatic,\\" Clarke reported to Berger. With virtually no evidence of a Taliban response, a new approach was made to Pakistan. 13 General Anthony Zinni, the commander of Central Command (CENTCOM), was designated as the President's special envoy and sent to ask General Musharraf to \\"take whatever action you deem necessary to resolve the Bin Laden problem at the earliest possible time.\\" But Zinni came back emptyhanded. As Ambassador William Milam reported from Islamabad, Musharraf was \\"unwilling to take the political heat at home.\\" The CIA worked hard with foreign security services to detain or at least keep an eye on suspected  Bin Laden associates. Tenet spoke to 20 of his foreign counterparts. Disruption and arrest operations were mounted against terrorists in eight countries. In mid-December, President Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification (MON) giving the CIA broader authority to use foreign proxies to detain  Bin Laden lieutenants, without having to transfer them to U.S. custody. The authority was to capture, not kill, though lethal force might be used if necessary.16Tenet would later send a message to all CIA personnel overseas, saying, \\"The threat could not be more real. <sep>What is the president and the CIA's main goal in the article?<sep>To predict the millennium series of attacks A:","output":"Is the answer \\"To predict the millennium series of attacks\\" valid? No. Explanation: The main goal of the president and the CIA in the article is to deter and disrupt al Qaeda plots, not to predict the millennium series of attacks.

It allows users to purchase, download, and organize their digital media, as well as sync it with their Apple devices. The question is whether iTunes can be used on Android devices. The answer is no. iTunes is not natively available on Android devices due to its exclusivity to Apple's ecosystem. Apple has specifically designed iTunes to be used on their devices, such as iPhones, iPads, iPods, and Mac computers. However, there are some alternative methods and third-party applications available that can help Android users to access their iTunes library and sync their music collection with their Android devices. These methods often involve transferring files manually or using a cloud storage service. Users can also use other music streaming platforms, like Google Play Music or Spotify, which are available on both iOS and Android, to stream or download their music on an Android device."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Residents of Bac Giang in north-east Vietnam had never seen anything like the angry mob that choked the city's streets late last month. Thousands of people blocked the city centre for the entire afternoon. At the head of the protest was a coffin adorned with white-flower wreaths and a picture of a young man, Nguyen Van Khuong, who had died a day earlier in police custody. A video clip posted on YouTube showed a large group of men smash through the gate of the municipal People's Committee and hurl stones and rocks at the police. Security forces tried to disperse the crowd with tear gas and batons but the protesters only withdrew after the city's leaders came to negotiate with the family of the deceased man. \\"The police killed my relative Nguyen Van Khuong, there is no doubt of it,\\" said one member of the victim's family. Mr Khuong, 21, was stopped by traffic police in Bac Giang on 23 July for not wearing his motorcycle helmet and taken in for questioning. His girlfriend waited outside for more than an hour before being told that Mr Khuong had fallen ill and had been taken to hospital. When she arrived there, she was told he had passed away. \\"They just returned the body and did not provide any explanation, that's why we are so upset and decided to take his body to the People's Committee to demand [an explanation],\\" said Mr Khuong's relative. Only last week, more than 10 days after the incident, a local policeman was arrested on suspicion of causing the young man's death but the official media have not provided details on how it happened. Nguyen Van Khuong's case is the latest in a series of clashes between residents and local authorities. In May, an incident in Thanh Hoa province ended with two civilian fatalities. A 45-year-old man and a 12-year-old boy were shot when police tried to disperse a crowd protesting against a government industrial project. Dozens of people were arrested just weeks earlier in a Catholic commune in Danang during a rally by hundreds of residents against land confiscation. According to statistics released by the Government Inspectorate, during the past five years there were nearly 4,000 cases of public protest, 550 of which attracted more than 50 people. Although the main reasons for public grievance remain land policies, other causes include corruption and official wrongdoing. \\"The Vietnamese people are in general kind and peace-loving, they never want to cause trouble,\\" say Prof Tuong Lai, a leading sociologist in Vietnam. \\"They only protest when they have been pressed to the point of explosion. Like we say in Vietnamese: the dyke breaks when the flood water is too strong. \\"I don't believe they have been agitated by 'foreign reactionary forces' or 'extremist elements',\\" he says. Prof Tuong Lai says the increasing regularity of public protests indicates \\"serious problems in society\\" that need special attention from the leadership. \\"The Communist Party and the central government should make efforts to resolve social conflicts through being absolutely transparent and respectful of the laws,\\" says Prof Tuong Lai. \\"Gone is the time when [they] can shut down the media in order to conceal official wrongdoings and force their opinion on the public as there is so much information available on the internet.\\" But with the Communist Party Congress coming in less than six months, when the country's leadership for the next five years will be elected, analysts say people will want their voice heard and protests are bound to occur more often. Prof Tuong Lai warns that incidents like that in Bac Giang cannot be swept under the carpet. \\"For once, the public wants to see a responsible government that punishes wrongdoings in a most transparent manner.\\" Vietnam always takes great pride in having one of the most \\"safe and stable\\" countries in the world, Prof Tuong Lai says.  But he says that public grievances might pose a grave threat to the regime if no action is taken to address them.

Answer the following question: “Please remember me to myself!” When sliding toward mania in 2016, I begged this of my therapist. He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job. And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships—relationships I'd enjoyed since high school. I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding. Twenty-six months since I knew that somewhere in the deepest parts of who I am, I was slipping. Nine seasons since I begged Dr. Poe, “Remember me to myself!” I'm still recuperating. Yes. I have felt like I wasn't me. Julie lost her job:  A. Within months of noticing mental illness.  B. not enough information  C. When she told her employer she needed mental help.  D.
