In fact, as far as I was concerned, this was a nice, leisurely sport, complete with strawberries, cream and the great British sunshine. Wrong. Firstly, our lesson took place indoors on a chilly, overcast day in Yorkshire (despite the sun always shining in God's own county) and secondly- this is no 'leisurely' sport. From our arrival at the John Charles Centre for Sport (one of the leading venues for disability sport in the UK), it was obvious that this would be no 'easy ride.' On the court opposite, a game of Visually Impaired tennis was taking place with one of the players ranked second in the whole country. Whereas, on our court, we were faced with Nick, who is currently training for a place in the Wheelchair Racing squad at Rio 2016. I don't know how we always end up in these pickles… Hitting the ball is hard enough; let alone hitting it in the right direction, within the correct lines, over the net and on target. Throw in a Serve or two and it's enough to send you into a sporting frenzy! Having said that, I actually really enjoyed the session and could have happily carried on way into the night. I found it really quite addictive and even though I wasn't particularly any good, I was eager to improve and weirdly felt that I had some sort of potential. What's great about Tennis too is that it's accessible to all. It was easy enough for myself and Goz to play together. It's also very flexible in that you can play as a team or as a soloist… I guess dependent on how social you're feeling on the day! Although I have to admit, I do have a new-found respect for Tennis after discovering just how much skill is involved. At professional level, you clearly need a high level of fitness, coordination and tactical intelligence to succeed. However, at an amateur level, this is a really good fun sport that appeals to all ages, genders and abilities. I genuinely really enjoyed myself during the session and am seriously considering this as a sport that I will continue for years to come. Who knows, this might not be the last time you see me with a racket and ball… A friend once said to me that summer does not start until the Cricket season starts. Well not for me, it's all about the tennis! So when I got to see Venus and Serena Williams playing a doubles match in the 2012 Olympics at Wimbledon, then watching Nicholas Taylor (the American player who uses his feet to serve) in the Paralympics at Olympic Park, it was humbling and inspiring and allowed me to think I could at least give it a try. So its more than a bit of an understatement if I said I was looking forward to giving this sport ago. Once we had been put through our paces with a warm up game with some more experienced disabled players. The aim was to stay within the outside tennis court lines, and try not to get caught by the player that was trying to chase you down, a bit like Tag. Then we got a break down of the rules from the coaches, such as the 'two-bounce rule', which means as a disabled player I can allow the ball to bounce twice but must hit the ball before a third bounce. So if I play Andy Murray (in my dreams) he has one bounce, I have two. My disability has affected my body in a way that my strength is diagonal so the top of my body is stronger on the left side and on the bottom part of my body I am stronger on my right side. This means I have always had to work around doing things someone else in a wheelchair may not have to think about. Why do I tell you this? My serve! I can't use my right arm to serve like a pro. I also learnt that you have to be stationary when serving and that the ball cannot bounce before you hit it across the net. What I devised was to balance the ball on the racket, throw it up in the air and before it lands hit it over the net, well that was the plan. So when I finally got it over the net and the opponent player hit it back I felt like a double Wimbledon champion! To round off our lesson we played the game champion, this was where one set of players were champion and everyone else had to beat them to get the tile champion from them. It was the best of three. I don't know what it is but the competitiveness always comes out and the fact is I want to win… No, I need to win! Coach, Ross and myself did win, with no thanks to me. Woooohoooo!

Every year on this day, organizations all over the country celebrate young volunteers, educate young people about how they can help their country, and invite them to participate in service projects. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, \\"National Youth Service Day honors young volunteers and is an invitation to others to join hands and do our part as Americans.\\" Founded in 1988, NYSD originally took place on a Tuesday. Now the event lasts from Friday until Sunday so that more people can participate in it. More than 200 organizations work together to create thousands of projects each year. Millions of young people across the United States take part in these service projects. Long before the event, people, community groups, schools, and nonprofit organizations think of ways to meet their communities' needs. Then, they plan projects for young volunteers. Projects include bringing food to hungry people, tutoring younger children and helping senior citizens. During the event, young people from the community do things like planting neighborhood gardens and cleaning up local parks. The organizations that contribute to NYSD believe that volunteering and community service are important activities for people of all ages, but especially for young people. Young people who volunteer are more likely to do well in school, vote, and contribute to charities. More important, they help other people and make the world a better place for everyone.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"If we start to clean the air and store pollution somewhere else, it is likely that there will be a decrease in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, present in the atmosphere. This reduction will have a direct impact on the greenhouse effect and global warming. Let us discuss this in more detail. 1. Less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere: By cleaning the air and storing pollution elsewhere, we will remove a significant amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases are responsible for trapping heat radiation, which would otherwise escape into space. Consequently, less heat will be trapped within the atmosphere. 2. Reduced greenhouse effect: With the decrease in greenhouse gas concentrations, the Earth's atmosphere will be less efficient in retaining heat energy. The greenhouse effect – the process by which these gases block and re-radiate some of the outgoing heat energy – will be weakened. This means that the Earth's atmosphere will lose more heat to space, resulting in a decrease in temperature. 3. Slowing of global warming: The reduction in greenhouse gases and the resulting decline in the greenhouse effect will lead to a slowing down of the global warming process. This is essential to try and mitigate some of the more catastrophic consequences associated with a rapidly warming planet, such as severe weather events, ice melting, and subsequent sea-level rise. 4. Influence on the second effect mentioned: The second effect mentioned refers to the increased heat radiation trapped in the atmosphere due to an increase in greenhouse gases. If we start to clean the air and store pollution elsewhere, it will significantly affect this second effect by decreasing the amount of trapped heat radiation in the atmosphere. Therefore, in conclusion, by cleaning the air and storing pollution elsewhere, the supposed perturbation will lead to a significant reduction in both greenhouse gas concentrations and the greenhouse effect. This will result in a decrease in trapped heat radiation and a slowing of global warming. To answer the question, the supposed perturbation will likely have a \\"less\\" effect on the greater greenhouse effect and its associated consequences mentioned earlier."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question.

Commonly called 'light bulbs', lamps are the removable and replaceable part of a light fixture, which converts electrical energy into electromagnetic radiation. While lamps have traditionally been rated and marketed primarily in terms of their power consumption, expressed in watts, proliferation of lighting technology beyond the incandescent light bulb has eliminated the correspondence of wattage to the amount of light produced. For example, a 60 W incandescent light bulb produces about the same amount of light as a 13 W compact fluorescent lamp. Each of these technologies has a different efficacy in converting electrical energy to visible light. Visible light output is typically measured in lumens. This unit only quantifies the visible radiation, and excludes invisible infrared and ultraviolet light. A wax candle produces on the close order of 13 lumens, a 60 watt incandescent lamp makes around 700 lumens, and a 15-watt compact fluorescent lamp produces about 800 lumens, but actual output varies by specific design.

Learn: Forgiving others doesn't necessarily involve learning as its main objective. Though one might learn from the experience, learning isn't the primary purpose of forgiveness. 2. Give hug: This option feels unrelated to the purpose of forgiveness. Giving a hug might be a sign of forgiving or a way to show affection, but it doesn't indicate the state or characteristic of the person forgiving. 3. Happiness: Forgiveness can lead to happiness, as it releases negativity and promotes well-being. It makes sense as a potential answer. 4. Nice to: The phrasing of this option is unclear, but if it means being 'nice to others', then yes, forgiveness can be a way to demonstrate kindness. This option also makes sense. 5.

Question: The creator of Gipsy and a writer from Belgium that held a relativistic view when describing comics was? Context: European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination. No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.

Milliken, a senior chief special warfare officer, was killed during an operation against the terrorist group al-Shabab in Barii, about 40 miles west of Mogadishu, the Somali capital. Two other service members were wounded, the Pentagon said Friday. A Press Herald file photo shows Kyle Milliken (seated, front) with the state-record-setting Cheverus High School relay team in April 1998. Also pictured, standing from left, are Ryan Toothaker, Nick Nappi, and Ryan Demers. Staff photo by Doug Jones Related Headlines Navy SEALs one of U.S. military’s most elite forces ‘Advise and assist’ mission took Falmouth SEAL into harm’s way In a statement released through the Department of Defense, the Milliken family thanked the community for its interest but asked for privacy. “He was a devoted father and son, a true professional and a wonderful husband,” the family said. Milliken grew up in Falmouth and graduated in 1998 from Cheverus High School, where he was one of the school’s top track stars. He and three teammates set the record for the 1,600-meter relay for Class A schools in 1998, according to the Maine Principals’ Association. “His former teachers, administrators, coaches and friends pray that eternal rest be granted to him, perpetual light shine upon him and that he rest in peace,” said the Rev. George E. Collins, president of Cheverus. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, who represents Maine’s 1st District, which includes Falmouth, said in a statement that Milliken was “an amazing athlete who could do flips on skis and run for miles.” SPECIALIZED IN FREE-FALL PARACHUTING Milliken enlisted in the Navy in 2002 and quickly joined the special operations forces. He underwent special warfare training in Coronado, California, and specialized in free-fall parachuting. He was based out of Virginia Beach, Virginia, starting in 2004. Milliken served combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and earned four Bronze Stars, among at least 30 medals and commendations. “We were a nation at war when he enlisted,” said Capt. Jason Salata, spokesman for the Naval Special Warfare Command. “He has four Bronze Stars. You don’t get that from sitting at home. You’re getting those kind of awards for valor.” According to Pingree, Milliken operated for many years with SEAL Team 6, an elite counterterrorism unit. “May we never forget his extraordinary bravery and incredible sacrifice,” Pingree said. Another member of Congress, Rep. Scott Taylor of Virginia, a former Navy SEAL whose district includes Virginia Beach, described Milliken as a “great friend, family man, and teammate” in a Facebook post Saturday afternoon. The fallen SEAL was “brilliant, witty and fiercely loyal,” Taylor wrote. In a written statement late Saturday night, Gov. Paul LePage expressed condolences from himself and his wife, Ann, to Milliken’s family. “On behalf of all Mainers, to the family and loved ones of Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator Kyle Milliken, there are no words that may provide comfort during this difficult time, but know he is a man we are forever indebted (to) for his service, sacrifice and protection of the freedoms we hold dear,” LePage said. In a joint statement, U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King of Maine said they were deeply saddened to learn about Milliken’s death. “He defended our nation with bravery and with distinction, and his sacrifice will never be forgotten,” the senators said. Milliken was assigned to an East Coast-based special warfare unit that was supporting Somali National Army-led operations. He was the first U.S. service member to die in Somalia since 1993, when 18 U.S. servicemen were killed after two helicopters were shot down over Mogadishu. Among them were two Mainers: Army Master Sgt. Gary Gordon of Lincoln and Army Staff Sgt. Thomas Field of Lisbon. The incident was recounted in the book and film “Black Hawk Down.” “Senior Chief Kyle Milliken embodied the warrior spirit and toughness infused in our very best Navy SEALs,” said Rear Adm. Timothy Szymanski, commander of the Naval Special Warfare Command. “We grieve his death, but we celebrate his life and many accomplishments. He is irreplaceable as a husband, father, son, friend and teammate – and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and teammates,” Szymanski said. “His sacrifice is a stark reminder that Naval Special Operators are forward doing their jobs, confronting terrorism overseas to prevent evil from reaching our shores.” MILITARY TARGETS AL-SHABAB COMPOUND Milliken was killed during a raid Friday on an al-Shabab compound. A firefight broke out after U.S. aircraft delivered Somali troops to the target area and U.S. troops were a distance back from the buildings, The Associated Press reported. The compound was targeted because it had been associated with attacks against U.S. and Somali forces. Al-Shabab militants have been fighting the Somali government and foreign forces for almost a decade and are responsible for numerous terrorist attacks, including assaults against civilian targets in Kenya. A Somali intelligence official told the AP that U.S. forces killed at least six people in the raid that targeted a building housing al-Shabab’s radio station and the dead included al-Shabab journalists. The battle comes as the U.S. is intensifying military operations in Somalia. In late March, President Trump authorized expanded offensive airstrikes against al-Shabab and the deployment of dozens of regular troops to the country, the largest deployment in decades. The Pentagon had increased special forces activity and airstrikes in Somalia under President Barack Obama. Somalia has been plagued by civil war since the government was overthrown in the early 1990s. The current national government is supported by the U.S. and an African Union peacekeeping force that is scheduled to leave the country in 2018. Staff Writer Megan Doyle contributed to this report.

Timothy Syzmanksi, the commander of the Naval Special Warfare Command, said Milliken \\"embodied the warrior spirit and toughness\\" that represent the Navy SEALS. Milliken was also a member of SEAL Team Six, the elite unit credited with killing Osama bin Laden in 2011, and he earned four Bronze Stars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \\"We grieve his death, but we celebrate his life and many accomplishments,\\" Syzmanksi said in a statement. \\"He is irreplaceable as a husband, father, son, friend and teammate — and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and teammates.” Milliken is the first U.S. service member to be killed in action in Somalia since the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu that led to the death of 18 service members and wounded 73 others — an event that inspired the book and later Hollywood film, \\"Black Hawk Down.\\" Related: Trump’s Army Secretary Pick Mark Green Withdraws Name From Consideration Milliken was part of the operation that had been coordinated between the Somali National Army and U.S. Africa Command.

Milliken and two others were injured in Thursday's attack and were medevaced to neighboring Djibouti, but Milliken died of his wounds. While the U.S. military is still analyzing intelligence to find out if the targets of the mission were among the dead, the Somali government declared it a victory. Omar Mohamud Elmi, the deputy governor of the Lower Shabelle region in Somalia, said the aim of the operation was to \\"surgically target\\" two elements: senior members of al-Shabab hiding in the area and a pro-al-Shabab media station. \\"The joint operation, the special operation, has successfully carried out a surgical strike on these two main elements killing many of the terrorists,\\" Elmi said. There are currently 50 American special forces members working in Somalia as part of the African Union mission. They are collaborating with local national commandos to “train and advise,” which is part of a ramped up effort to fight al-Shabab, an al Qaeda-allied group that has imposed Sharia law in areas of the country under its control. President Donald Trump approved the use of aggressive airstrikes and military operations to fight the group last month. |||||","output":"The US Department of Defense has identified the Navy SEAL killed in combat in Somalia as 38-year-old Kyle Milliken, a Falmouth native.

If he turned North and traveled twice the distance he had traveled to the East, calculate the total distance his journey took.. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"First, let's break down the problem step by step: 1. Johny traveled South 40 miles. 2. Johny turned East and traveled for 20 more miles than the distance he took to travel to the south (40 miles). So, he traveled 40 miles + 20 miles = 60 miles to the East. 3. Johny turned North and traveled twice the distance he had traveled to the East (60 miles). So, he traveled 2 × 60 miles = 120 miles to the North.

The former Bruce Jenner’s debut on the Vanity Fair cover on Monday put the Olympic champ turned reality star turned transgender icon in a position to outearn her fellow clan members, experts said. “She could become the wealthiest of them all,” said Rob Shuter, host of VH1’s “The Gossip Table” and former head of Dan Klores Communications. “If Bruce Jenner made 100 million in 65 years, if all the stars align, she could be worth over 500 million in the next five to 10 years. “Caitlyn is going to be a pioneer,” he added. Jenner doesn’t need the dough. Her estimated net worth is 100 million, according to reports on Celebrity Net Worth and The Richest, and she was already pulling in 40,000 for motivational speaking tours when she was known as Bruce. But now people can’t get enough of Caitlyn. Jenner’s “Dateline” interview with Diane Sawyer in April drew 17 million viewers on a Friday night. Her Twitter launch on Monday smashed the record by hitting 1 million followers in just over four hours. “A book deal could hit seven figures. Speeches could garner six figures each,” said Brian Balthazar, editor of Pop Goes the Week, a culture website. On the fashion and beauty front, the 22-page Vanity Fair spread proved Jenner can model couture by Zac Posen, Halston and Donna Karan, but some brands may take a wait-and-see approach before courting her. “The reality of it is, this is still very controversial for a lot of traditional Fortune 100 companies,” said Ryan Schinman, founder of the Platinum Rye Entertainment, a media branding company. “Certainly, companies might want to attach themselves to her social media and do some branding to reach the millions of followers she has, but these are mid-five to low six-figure deals.” It’s unclear if Jenner can sell makeup or fashion, but trans is hot, so all presumptions are off. “Jazz Jennings landed a Clean & Clear campaign, and Lea T is now the face of Redken,” said James Fox, CEO of Red Peak Branding. “Last year, Barneys released a campaign featuring 17 transgender models.” Will it play in Peoria? The best yardstick is what General Mills will do with its Wheaties cover. Bruce Jenner was an iconic pitchman — appearing on a cereal box in 1977, a year after his Olympic decathlon victory, and again in 2012 — but the company is still playing it coy. “Bruce Jenner has been a respected member of Team Wheaties, and Caitlyn Jenner will continue to be,” said General Mills spokesman Mike Siemienas. “But of course we do not discuss our future marketing plans.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Caitlyn Jenner, the Olympic champion turned reality star turned transgender icon, is in a position to outearn her Kardashian family members due to her influence and potential business opportunities in fashion, beauty, and motivational speaking.

Some also include the most southern and eastern parts of Lazio (Sora, Cassino, Gaeta, Cittaducale and Amatrice districts) within the \\"Mezzogiorno\\", because these territories were also part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The island of Sardinia, although for cultural and historical reasons having less in common with the aforementioned regions, is frequently included as Southern Italy or \\"Mezzogiorno\\", often for statistical and economical purposes. - The Italian Wars, often referred to as the Great Italian Wars or the Great Wars of Italy and sometimes as the HabsburgValois Wars or the Renaissance Wars, were a series of conflicts from 1494 to 1559 that involved, at various times, most of the city-states of Italy, the Papal States, the Republic of Venice, most of the major states of Western Europe (France, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, and Scotland) as well as the Ottoman Empire. Originally arising from dynastic disputes over the Duchy of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples, the wars rapidly became a general struggle for power and territory among their various participants, and were marked with an increasing number of alliances, counter-alliances, and betrayals. - Cerignola is a town and \\"comune\\" of Apulia, Italy, in the province of Foggia, southeast from the town of Foggia. It has the third-largest land area of any \\"comune\\" in Italy, at , after Rome and Ravenna. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.

Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Andria is a city and \\"comune\\" in Apulia (southern Italy). It is an agricultural and service center, producing wine, olives and almonds.

Select from: 1. yes; 2. it is not possible to tell; 3. no;","output":"1. yes To provide a detailed and long answer, it is important to understand the connection between the phrases \\"A security officer\\" and \\"A worker.\\" A security officer is a type of worker whose primary role is to ensure the safety and security of a facility, its occupants, and its assets. They often use a variety of tools and resources, such as radios, to carry out their duties effectively. The question requires us to consider if the statement \\"A security officer uses her radio\\" allows us to conclude that \\"A worker uses her radio.\\" To analyze this, we must determine whether a security officer falls under the category of a worker. A worker can be defined as a person who carries out tasks or provides services in exchange for compensation, usually monetary. It is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of jobs, including but not limited to, office workers, laborers, service providers, and of course, security officers. Workers may also hold part-time or full-time employment, temporary or permanent positions, and may work in either the formal or informal economy. In a typical work setting, security officers perform a variety of tasks as part of their duties, such as patrolling the premises, monitoring surveillance systems, responding to alarms, and communicating with other staff members and emergency responders when necessary. Utilizing a radio is a common method for efficient and prompt communication in these situations, as it allows the officer to coordinate efforts and stay updated on any incidents that may arise. Therefore, as a security officer is a type of worker, a statement indicating that a security officer is using her radio can be reasonably concluded to mean that a worker is using her radio. The information is specific enough to associate the action (using a radio) with both a security officer and a worker in general.

Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"2\\". According to the statement, most arthropods are small animals with six legs. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \\"arthropods are small animals with how many legs?\\" would be \\"6\\". Arthropods are a large and diverse group of invertebrate animals that have an exoskeleton, a segmented body, and jointed appendages. Arthropoda is the largest phylum in the animal kingdom, including insects, spiders, crustaceans, and other related organisms. While it is true that many arthropods have six legs, it is important to note that some arthropods have more than six legs, such as spiders (eight legs) and centipedes (multiple pairs of legs). The statement provided refers specifically to the fact that most arthropods have six legs, which typically belong to the class Insecta, also known as insects. Some examples of six-legged arthropods include ants, bees, butterflies, beetles, and flies, among others. Insects are remarkably diverse and can be found in almost every habitat on Earth, from the depths of the ocean to the highest mountain peaks. Overall, it is essential to understand that arthropods come in various shapes and sizes, with different numbers of legs. However, based on the provided information, the correct answer to the question would be that arthropods discussed in the statement are small animals with six legs."},{"instruction":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -599 + 986 = 43*p for p.","output":"To solve the equation -599 + 986 = 43*p for p, begin by simplifying the left side of the equation: Step 1: Simplify the left side -599 + 986 = 387 Now, the equation becomes: 387 = 43*p Step 2: Solve for p To solve for p, we need to isolate p on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 43: 387 ÷ 43 = 43*p ÷ 43 387 ÷ 43 = 9 So, the equation simplified becomes: 9 = p Thus, the value of p is 9."},{"instruction":"What could you do inside but not outside if you have boredom?

Skateboard: Inside: It is possible to skateboard inside a large, open space, such as a gym or a designated skate park, but it might be limited due to space constraints and potential damage to flooring. Outside: Skateboarding can be done at an outdoor skate park or streets as well, providing more space and variety of surfaces to skate on. 2. Hang out at a bar: Inside: Hanging out at a bar generally requires you to be indoors, as bars are typically located inside buildings or establishments. Outside: Although some bars have outside seating or patio areas, the act of hanging out at a bar is still primarily an indoor activity. 3. Laugh: Inside: Laughter can occur both indoors and outdoors, whether you're watching a comedy, participating in a group activity, or sharing a joke with friends. Outside: Laughter is not limited by location, so you can enjoy the benefits of laughter in the great outdoors as well. 4. Go skiing: Inside: Skiing is typically an outdoor activity, but there are some indoor ski slopes and facilities, such as Ski Dubai and SnowWorld, where you can practice skiing indoors. Outside: Skiing is primarily an outdoor activity, usually done in mountainous regions where there is natural snow, or at outdoor artificial ski slopes. 5.

Skateboarding and laughing can be done both indoors and outdoors. Skiing is mainly an outdoor activity, but under specific circumstances, it can be practiced indoors as well."},{"instruction":"Given the question: You are presented with the question \\"Burning wood is used to produce what type of energy?\\" and the following answer choices: - Light - warmth - potential - Fuel cells - food - electrical - mechanical - kinetic Now knowing that burning wood is used to produce heat and heat is kinetic energy, choose the best answer. The answer is:","output":"Warmth. Burning wood is used to produce heat, which is a form of kinetic energy. Kinetic energy refers to the energy that an object possesses due to its motion. When wood is burned, a chemical reaction called combustion occurs, which releases the stored chemical potential energy within the wood as heat, light, and various byproducts. In the given answer choices, the closest term to describe the type of energy produced by burning wood is \\"warmth,\\" which essentially refers to the heat that is generated. While heat is technically a form of kinetic energy, the term \\"kinetic\\" on its own is too broad, as it could refer to various other forms of motion-related energy. Additionally, it is important to note that other answer choices are not accurate or not directly related to the energy produced by burning wood: - Light: Although burning wood does produce light, it is a secondary effect and not the primary energy output. - Potential: This type of energy refers to the stored energy an object has due to its position or configuration and is not produced by burning wood. - Fuel cells: These devices convert chemical energy into electrical energy, which is not done by burning wood. - Food: Burning wood does not produce food, and food is a source of energy for living organisms, but it is not a type of energy. - Electrical: Burning wood does not directly produce electricity; however, the heat generated can be used in systems to produce electricity (e.g., steam turbines). - Mechanical: This type of energy relates to the motion and position of an object but is generally not associated with the process of combustion or burning wood. Therefore, among the answer choices provided, \\"warmth\\" is the best answer to describe the type of energy produced from burning wood."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What does Sid's neighboring miner have to give up after being arrested? The film begins by introducing Kellyanne Williamson, playing with imaginary friends Pobby and Dingan. The family of Rex Williamson—his wife, Anne, daughter Kellyanne and son Ashmol—have moved to Coober Pedy, known as the \\"opal capital of Australia\\", because Rex believed he could make a fortune in mining opal. So far he's had little success. Ashmol, while he loves his sister, is frequently annoyed when she talks to her imaginary friends, and some of the kids at school tease the siblings because of them. Rex and Anne decide it is time to separate Kellyanne from her invisible companions. Annie takes Kellyanne to a Christmas party at Annie's friend's house, Rex telling her that he will let Pobby and Dingan come with him to go opal mining. Upon Rex's return, Kellyanne says she can no longer see them and that they have disappeared. She insists on going to the opal mining area to look for them, accompanied by Rex and Ashmol. The family accidentally strays on to a neighbouring miner's claim. The miner, Sid, pulls a shotgun on Rex and calls the police, thinking that Rex was \\"ratting\\" on his territory - that is, looking for opals on his turf. Kellyanne is grief-stricken at the loss of her imaginary friends and takes ill, although doctors can find nothing physically wrong with her. Rex has to leave his opal claim. Annie loses her job at the local supermarket, thanks to the circulating rumours around Rex's arrest. Convinced that Kellyanne is faking her illness, Ashmol nonetheless goes along with her wish that he try to find Pobby and Dingan. He even comes up with the idea of putting posters around town. Ultimately, returning to his father's mine area, Ashmol finds two lollipop wrappers. Deeper in the tunnel, he finds a large opal which he takes back to Kellyanne. He tells her he has found Pobby and Dingan, and that they are dead. Answer:","output":"After being arrested, Sid's neighboring miner has to give up his opal claim."},{"instruction":"The little party in the cabin, so disastrously begun, finished, under the mellowing influence of wine and woman, in excellent feeling and with some hilarity. Mamie, in a plush Gainsborough hat and a gown of wine-coloured silk, sat, an apparent queen, among her rude surroundings and companions. The dusky litter of the cabin set off her radiant trimness: tarry Johnson was a foil to her fair beauty; she glowed in that poor place, fair as a star; until even I, who was not usually of her admirers, caught a spark of admiration; and even the captain, who was in no courtly humour, proposed that the scene should be commemorated by my pencil. It was the last act of the evening. Hurriedly as I went about my task, the half-hour had lengthened out to more than three before it was completed: Mamie in full value, the rest of the party figuring in outline only, and the artist himself introduced in a back view, which was pronounced a likeness. But it was to Mamie that I devoted the best of my attention; and it was with her I made my chief success. Do you have any questions?","output":"First, I would like to clarify the context of the scene. It appears that the characters are having a party in a cabin, and Mamie is the center of attention, dressed elegantly and exuding beauty. The other characters present include the narrator, who is an artist, the captain, and tarry Johnson. As the party progresses, they enjoy themselves, and the captain suggests that the narrator should create a drawing to capture the moment. The narrator then focuses primarily on depicting Mamie and completes the drawing over an extended period of time. With this understanding of the scene, here are my questions: 1. What is the relationship between Mamie and the other characters, particularly the narrator and the captain? 2. What is the significance of the \\"plush Gainsborough hat\\" and \\"wine-coloured silk\\" gown that Mamie is wearing? Are these unusual choices for the setting, or do they carry any specific meaning within the context of the story? 3. What is the mood of the party during the drawing, as it takes time to complete? Do the characters grow impatient, or do they continue enjoying themselves throughout the process? 4. Does the act of capturing this scene in a drawing have any significance or importance for the development of the story or character relationships? 5. Is there any particular reason why the narrator chooses to depict themselves from behind, in a back view, in the drawing?"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Title: Disappointed Review: As a minister, I was hoping to find some stories here that I could re-tell.

Pennington. They started by playing local clubs which led to touring with Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars opening shows and providing backup for major rock artists of the period. Their name was shortened to Exile in 1973, consisting of guitarist Pennington, leader/lead singer Jimmy Stokley, Bernie Faulkner B3 sax acoustic guitar, Billy Luxon trumpet, keyboardist Buzz Cornelison, bassist Kenny Weir, and drummer Bobby Johns. The band changed musical styles throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. They shortened their name to Exile in 1973 and released their eponymous debut album through Wooden Nickel Records that same year. Singles released from the album proved unsuccessful, and it would be a good five years before the band released a full-length follow-up album. In 1977, the band released the single \\"Try it On\\" on Atco Records, and it became a minor hit. The following year, Mike Chapman, an Australian who had established himself as a record producer in the UK, came to the United States in search of an experienced group who wrote their own material. Chapman heard an Exile demo and went to their next concert. Chapman evidently enjoyed what he saw. He and Exile decided to collaborate and together they produced the Mixed Emotions album on Warner/Curb Records. The first single release from that album was Kiss You All Over. The single reached Billboard's Top 40 on 5 August 1978. It remained on the chart for seventeen weeks and was No. 1 for four weeks in September. It was a best-seller for six months. Their follow up single, \\"You Thrill Me,\\" also from the Mixed Emotions LP did not fare as well, although it did reach the Top 40 for one week on 3 February 1979. The band toured with Aerosmith, Heart, Dave Mason, Boston, Seals & Crofts and other hot pop acts of the late seventies throughout the United States, Europe and Africa. All There Is, the group's second Warner Bros. Records album, recorded a year later with a distinct disco beat, yielded a foreign hit, \\"The Part Of Me That Needs You Most.\\" This single did particularly well in Europe and South Africa. Don't Leave Me This Way, their third album, produced by Peter Coleman, yielded two more singles, \\"Take Me Down\\" and \\"Smooth Sailing.\\" Once again, it did well in Europe and South Africa although their popularity in the United States waned. Numerous personnel changes took place in 1979. Perhaps most significantly, Stokley would leave the group that year, forcing remaining members guitarist/vocalist J.P. Pennington, keyboardist Buzz Cornelison, keyboardist/vocalist Marlon Hargis, bassist/vocalist Sonny Lemaire and drummers Steve Goetzman and Gary Freeman to search for a new lead singer. A young singer, Les Taylor, accepted an invitation to join the group and shared lead vocal duties with Pennington. By the early 1980s, other lineup changes took place, including the exit of original member Buzz Cornelison, plus keyboardist Mark Gray, who co-wrote \\"The Closer You Get\\" and \\"Take Me Down\\", both of which became hits for the group Alabama, played a short stint from 1980 to 1982.

Lily is a smart and ambitious young artist, who aspires to have her paintings displayed in prestigious galleries around the world. Both Maurice and Lily are based in London, which is where Maurice's favorite painting is found. Step 2: Set the main conflict In our story, the main conflict begins when Maurice's favorite painting - a centuries-old masterpiece that has great cultural significance - goes missing from the London gallery where it was housed.

Step 3: Introduce subplot and other characters During their investigation, Maurice and Lily cross paths with a secretive art collector named Thomas, who appears to possess valuable information about the missing painting. However, his cooperation comes at a price: he demands a rare artwork from Lily in exchange for his help. This subplot serves as an opportunity to explore the challenges and moral dilemmas faced by emerging artists and the world of art collection. Step 4: Develop the climax and resolution As Maurice and Lily venture deeper into London's underground art scene, they discover that the missing painting has been stolen as part of an elaborate heist orchestrated by a criminal mastermind with a vendetta against the art world. Against all odds, the duo manages to recover the painting and thwart the mastermind's nefarious plans.

Straws have become a huge problem in ocean contamination--in fact, they're one of the most common pieces of trash picked up on beaches. Eliminating straw use is easy and straightforward--if you order a drink that comes with a straw, just tell the waiter, barista, or worker that you don't need one.","output":"Furthermore, you can carry your own reusable straw made from materials like stainless steel, bamboo, or glass. These alternatives are much more eco-friendly and can be easily cleaned and stored in your bag or pocket. By bringing your own reusable straw, you not only reduce your plastic consumption, but also demonstrate to those around you that there are practical alternatives to single-use plastics. In addition to skipping plastic straws, consider opting for reusable bags when shopping. Replace single-use plastic bags with reusable tote bags made of fabric, canvas, or other sustainable materials. Keep a few in your car or bag so you always have them on hand when you go shopping. This switch not only benefits the environment by reducing plastic waste but also saves you from having to pay for plastic bags in regions where they charge for them. Another effective way to reduce plastic use is by using a refillable water bottle instead of constantly purchasing single-use plastic ones. Choose a bottle made from materials like stainless steel, glass, or BPA-free plastic to carry with you on the go. This helps decrease plastic waste while also saving you money on bottled water. Additionally, it is a healthier choice, as drinking from a reusable bottle often ensures better water quality as it is less susceptible to bacterial contamination and harmful chemicals. When purchasing products, consider shopping for those with minimal or completely plastic-free packaging. Items like fruit and vegetables often come in single-use plastic wrapping which can be easily avoided by choosing loose products or those packaged ecologically. When shopping at local markets or bulk stores, you can bring your own reusable containers and bags for produce and other items. This not only reduces plastic waste but also minimizes your exposure to packaging that could potentially contaminate your food. Another crucial step in reducing plastic use is by reusing and repurposing existing plastic items. Instead of automatically disposing of plastic containers, utensils, or other products, give them a second life by finding alternative uses for them in your home. For instance, clean plastic containers can be used to store household items, pack lunch, or even serve as makeshift plant pots. Lastly, make an effort to recycle any plastic waste that you cannot avoid. Proper recycling reduces the likelihood of plastic ending up in landfills, where it can take hundreds or even thousands of years to break down. By participating in recycling initiatives and encouraging others to do the same, you can greatly contribute to the reduction of plastic pollution. Reducing plastic use requires mindfulness and a commitment to making eco-friendly choices, but it is an essential step towards a sustainable future. By adopting these strategies and leading by example, you can help protect the environment while promoting positive change within your community and beyond."},{"instruction":"Identify the most salient words in this sentence: late gothic revival structure and tourist attraction against a cloudy sky","output":"The most salient words in this sentence are: 1. Late Gothic Revival: This refers to the architectural style of the structure and is significant because it gives the context of the design and time period. \\"Late Gothic Revival\\" is an architectural movement that began in the mid-18th century and continued into the early 20th century.

In this case, it refers to the building, or any constructed object, that showcases the late Gothic Revival architectural style. 3. Tourist Attraction: This phrase is important because it indicates that the structure holds significance and interest for visitors and sightseers.

Options: (A) 18 (B) 22 (C) 42 (D) 41 (E) 74 Random thoughts:","output":"To answer this question, let's first understand the pattern. The pattern of colored shirts is: red, green, blue, yellow. This is a sequence of 4 colors. Now we know that this pattern continues until it ends with a green shirt. So the sequence would look something like this: red, green, blue, yellow, red, green, blue, yellow, ..., green. Since the pattern ends with a green shirt, it means that it either ends on the second term of the color pattern, the sixth term, the tenth term, and so on. In other words, it ends on a term with a multiple of 4, plus 2 (2, 6, 10, ...). Mathematically: number of people in line = 4n + 2, where n is any non-negative integer. Now let's test each of the options to see which one cannot be the number of people in the line: (A) 18: 18 - 2 = 16, which is a multiple of 4. This means that this option could be the number of people in line. (B) 22: 22 - 2 = 20, which is a multiple of 4. This means that this option could be the number of people in line. (C) 42: 42 - 2 = 40, which is a multiple of 4. This means that this option could be the number of people in line. (D) 41: 41 - 2 = 39, which is not a multiple of 4. This means that this option cannot be the number of people in the line. (E) 74: 74 - 2 = 72, which is a multiple of 4. This means that this option could be the number of people in line. So, based on this analysis, the answer is: (D) 41."},{"instruction":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: A plate of chicken, green beans and mashed potatoes.","output":"Hey buddy, the keywords in this sentence are \\"plate\\", \\"chicken\\", \\"green beans\\", and \\"mashed potatoes\\".

Answer:","output":"Robert Henry Lawrence, Jr. was born on October 2, 1935, in Chicago, Illinois. He was an accomplished individual right from the start, demonstrating a keen interest in serving his nation. His commitment led him to join the United States Air Force, where he rose to the rank of Major. In 1967, he was selected for the United States Air Force MOL group, contributing significantly to the nation's astronaut program. Despite the mission notation being absent, Lawrence's role as a United States Air Force Astronaut speaks volumes about his extraordinary abilities. Adding to his impressive resume, Lawrence was also a skilled test pilot, a high-risk job that underlines his bravery. Tragically, his dedication to service led to his untimely demise during a training exercise. On December 8, 1967, Lawrence was tragically killed at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The sudden demise of such a promising astronaut during training left a significant vacuum in the United States Air Force.

In fact, the hypothesis contradicts the given premise. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis to understand this better. Premise: The statement given as the premise is that it is best to book in advance for the activities at The Ark, as it has become quite popular, and activities sometimes fill up in advance. This suggests that due to the popularity of The Ark, there is a risk of not being able to participate in the activities if one doesn't book in advance. The contact information, including the telephone number and fax number, is provided to encourage booking ahead of time. Hypothesis: The hypothesis states that there is plenty of room at The Ark, and there is no need to book in advance. This implies that there is ample space and availability for all who wish to join the activities, and booking beforehand is not necessary. Comparison: When comparing the premise and the hypothesis, it is clear that they contradict each other. The premise suggests that The Ark's popularity leads to a higher likelihood of activities being fully booked, necessitating advance booking to ensure participation. Conversely, the hypothesis claims that there is ample room at The Ark, eliminating the need for advance booking. In conclusion, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise; instead, it contradicts the information presented in the premise.

Step 1: Find out how much money Rica had before she spent 1/5 of it. If Rica is left with 300, then this means that 300 is equal to 4/5 of her initial prize money share, since she spent 1/5 of it. To find the original amount, we can set up a proportion: (4/5) * (Rica's original prize money) = 300 To solve for Rica's original prize money, we will divide both sides of the equation by 4/5: Rica's original prize money = 300 / (4/5) = 300 * (5/4) = 375 Step 2: Determine the fraction of the prize money that Rica received. Rica received 3/8 of the total prize money. Step 3: Calculate the total prize money. To find the total prize money, we can set up a proportion using the fraction from step 2: (3/8) * (total prize money) = Rica's original prize money Now we know that Rica's original prize money is 375, so we can plug this value into the proportion: (3/8) * (total prize money) = 375 To solve for the total prize money, we will divide both sides of the equation by 3/8: Total prize money = 375 / (3/8) = 375 * (8/3) = 1000 The prize money that Rica's group won is 1000."},{"instruction":"A German ethnicity emerged in the course of the Middle Ages, ultimately as a result of the formation of the kingdom of Germany within East Francia and later the Holy Roman Empire, beginning in the 9th century.

Criticising Russia, Mr Trump urged Moscow to \\"join the community of responsible nations\\". Mr Trump is in Poland ahead of a G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. In Warsaw, he addressed a large, cheering crowd from the monument to the 1944 Uprising in the city, on Krasinski Square. Poland's conservative government shares Mr Trump's hostile view of immigration and strong sense of sovereignty. What did Trump say exactly? \\"As the Polish experience reminds us, the defence of the West ultimately rests not only on means but also on the will of its people to prevail,\\" Mr Trump said. \\"The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Trump said North Korea faced consequences for its \\"very, very bad behaviour\\" He called on Russia to \\"cease its destabilising activities in Ukraine and elsewhere and its support for hostile regimes including Syria and Iran\\".

The US leader is to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time in Hamburg. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian presidency did not accept that Russia had been destabilising the region. \\"This is exactly why we are waiting for the first meeting of the two presidents,\\" he added.

Warsaw and three Baltic states have spoken against the construction of an offshore Russian gas pipeline to Germany, known as Nord Stream 2. Why did Trump single out Poland? US leaders are almost always guaranteed a warm welcome in Poland, which will contrast with the protests being planned for the G20 summit in Hamburg.

It is estimated that 99% of trade between Japan and the EU will be liberalised, while an accompanying strategic partnership deal will see them co-operate in other areas, from climate change to tackling terrorism. Both want to show they are committed to a world order built on open trade and international co-operation, in contrast to Mr Trump's America that is turning inward, BBC Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticas reports. EU-Japan trade talks had stalled after four years but when Mr Trump took office and scrapped his own possible Pacific trade partnership this year, it spurred them into action, and they resolved most of their differences in a matter of weeks. ||||| U.S. President Donald Trump is greeted by Polish President Andrzej Duda as he visits Poland during the Three Seas Initiative Summit in Warsaw, Poland July 6, 2017.

Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - \`\` Stellar Ships '' or \`\` Star Ships '' ( Russian name \`\` Zvezdnye Korabli '' , Russian : ) is a short story by the Soviet writer and paleontologist Ivan Yefremov written in 1944 and first published in 1948 in the USSR . This story is about the discovery of an ancient dinosaur bone with a mysterious bullet hole ( or \`\` blaster hole '' ) and an alien skull and his portrait nearby . This acts as a starting point and a cover story to the philosophical idea of plurality of the mind cradles in the Universe , similarity of planet evolution paths , and similarity of physiology and psychology . Efremov states the final perspective for all civilisations is The Great Circle , which will unite them all . - An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\" - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - Ivan Antonovich (real patronymic Antipovich) Yefremov (April 22, 1908 October 5, 1972), last name sometimes spelled Efremov, was a Soviet paleontologist, science fiction author and social thinker.

After Oxford, Stephen went to Cambridge University. Three years later, in 1965, he became a doctor of philosophy . Because of his serious health problems, it was difficult for him to draw diagrams or to write. So he started to think in pictures.

Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why did the patient feel for R?

When an insect opens its spiracles, air is drawn in and transported through the tracheal tubes, which branch out and supply oxygen to all parts of the insect's body. Once the oxygen has been used up, the carbon dioxide waste is then expelled through the spiracles. Overall, spiracles play an important role in the respiratory process of insects.

Plot title: Valkyrie Movie plot: During World War II, Wehrmacht Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise) is severely wounded during an RAF air raid in Tunisia, losing his right hand, the ring and little finger on his left hand, and his left eye, and is evacuated home to Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, Major General Henning von Tresckow (Branagh) attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler by smuggling a bomb aboard the FÃ¼hrer's personal airplane. The bomb, however, is a dud and fails to detonate, and Tresckow flies to Berlin in order to safely retrieve it. After learning that the Gestapo has arrested Major General Hans Oster, he orders General Olbricht (Nighy) to find a replacement. After recruiting Stauffenberg into the German Resistance, Olbricht presents Stauffenberg at a meeting of the secret committee which has coordinated previous attempts on Hitler's life. The members include General Ludwig Beck (Stamp), Dr. Carl Goerdeler (McNally), and Erwin von Witzleben (Schofield). Stauffenberg is stunned to learn that no plans exist on the subject of what is to be done after Hitler's assassination. During a bombing raid on Berlin, he gets the idea of using Operation Valkyrie, which involves the deployment of the Reserve Army to maintain order in the event of a national emergency. The plotters carefully redraft the plan's orders so that they can dismantle the Nazi rÃ©gime after assassinating Hitler. Realizing that only General Friedrich Fromm (Wilkinson), the head of the Reserve Army, can initiate Valkyrie, they offer him a position as head of the Wehrmacht in a post-Nazi Germany and request his support, but Fromm declines to be directly involved, stating he will not side with them so long as Hitler is alive. With the rewritten Operation Valkyrie orders needing to be signed by Hitler (Bamber), Stauffenberg visits the FÃ¼hrer at his Berghof estate in Bavaria.

Therefore a wet year was followed buy a dry one, and the fires started again. and a hint : When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20] Please answer this question : Which month of the year was drier, July 2017 or September 2016? A:","output":"Before answering the given question, let us first understand the situation and relevant information provided. In 2016, monsoon conditions prevailed across the Desert Southwest from July to September due to the northward migration of the subtropical ridge across North America. However, in 2017, the atmosphere dried out in the Desert Southwest, leading to a break in the monsoon regime. This drying out would have caused a substantial decrease in rainfall compared to the previous year. Considering this information, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which month was drier, i.e., July 2017 or September 2016, without having concrete rainfall data for these specific months. Nonetheless, we can infer that the monsoon conditions were more favorable in 2016, with increased rainfall compared to 2017 when the atmosphere was drier due to changes in the subtropical ridge position. Therefore, it is likely that July 2017 experienced drier conditions than September 2016 because it occurred during a year with a break in the monsoon regime. However, to confirm this conclusion, actual rainfall data would be required for both months."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following conversation and answer the question.

In fact, food is an important part of French culture. Families and friends spend hours over the dinner table each night. It is the opposite of the fast-food habit common in other parts of the West. It's the reason why the French are very angry that a McDonald's is opening beneath Paris's most famous museum: the Louvre . The new restaurant will be the 1,142nd McDonald's in France, and will open in the underground approach to the museum. But many French people can't understand why this American chain is opening in the heart of French culture. However, McDonald's is paying no notice to the complaint. McDonald's now has 31,000 chains worldwide. Tourists are hungry, and opening chains in tourist spots pays well. There is another chain threatening France's heritage. This time it is coffee rather than burgers. As more and more Starbucks open in Paris, traditional French cafes are forced to close. The trouble with American companies opening chains throughout the world is the destructive effect they can have on a country's culture. How can a small, independent coffee shop compete with the multi-billion dollar chain? You can go to a Starbucks in any city in the world, but you can only go to a Parisian cafe in France. Responsibility is with the tourists. A McDonald's wouldn't open so near the Louvre if it weren't not going to make money.

Unbeknownst to the townspeople, Mayor Hartman’s criminal connections run deep, helping him maintain control through blackmail, bribery, and manipulation. On the surface, he appears to be a kind and charismatic leader, but as the town's workings behind closed doors unravel, the truth about his sinister activities begins to surface. The story begins with the arrival of newcomer Becca Wallace, an ambitious investigative reporter, who has been sent to Gull's Bay by her editor to cover the town's quaint charms and history. As she explores the town and interviews its residents, Becca quickly becomes intrigued by the rumors and whispers about Mayor Hartman's double life. Sensing a breakthrough story, she begins to dig deeper into the mayor's hidden past, seeking the proof she needs to expose his corruption. Her investigation pits her against Sheriff Thompson, a reluctant ally and longtime friend of Hartman, who has turned a blind eye to the mayor's misconduct. Both men had been instrumental in driving out a dangerous biker gang some twenty years ago, making them heroes in the eyes of the town.

The Burmilla cat originated in the United Kingdom as a result of an accidental breeding between a Chinchilla Persian and a Burmese cat in the early 1980s. This breed is known for its silky coat, expressive eyes, and gentle temperament. Burmilla cats come in two coat types: short-hair and semi-longhair. Their coat color may vary between different shades of silver, black, blue, chocolate, lilac, and red, with or without shading. The Burmilla's eyes are typically green, with shades ranging from pale to deep emerald green. The Burmilla breed is friendly, social, and affectionate, making it an excellent family pet. They are also intelligent, curious, and playful, making them an engaging companion for their owners. Burmillas are known to get along well with other pets, such as dogs if they are introduced properly. The Burmilla's moderate activity level makes them adapt well to both house and apartment living, provided they have enough mental and physical stimulation. They appreciate the company of their human family and do not like to be left alone for extended periods. Regular grooming is essential to maintain their luxurious coat, particularly in the case of the semi-longhair variety. Burmilla cats have few known breed-specific health issues. However, they may be prone to some health problems associated with their Persian and Burmese ancestry, such as Polycystic Kidney Disease and Hypokalemia. Regular veterinary check-ups and a balanced diet can contribute to ensuring a healthy and happy life for your Burmilla cat."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Spores are dispersed into the air by a mature mushroom - The spores fall to the ground - The spores germinate - The spores begin to grow mycelium - The mycelium begin to sprout a bud A:","output":"The final step of the following process is: A.

Pellegrini is facing a job appraisal at the end of the season, as does Ferran Soriano, the chief executive, and the sporting director, Txiki Begiristain. There is a sense Pellegrini could still be in the job when next season starts, as one issue facing the Abu Dhabi hierarchy would be who could replace him. City’s No1 candidate is Pep Guardiola but the Bayern Munich coach has said he will serve out a contract that expires in the summer of 2016. Of the other possible contenders, Real Madrid’s Carlo Ancelotti was passed over in favour of Pellegrini following Roberto Mancini’s sacking two years ago, and the style of football played by Diego Simeone’s Atlético Madrid is not considered cultured enough to match City’s aspirations. Patrick Vieira, the elite development squad coach, is admired by the club and thought of as a potential future manager. Yet the view is that the Frenchman may not quite be ready. However if Pellegrini were to be removed before the end of the campaign, Vieira may act as a stop-gap, as Ryan Giggs did when becoming Manchester United interim manager after the sacking of David Moyes with four matches left of last term. While Pellegrini’s appraisal is due in the close season, Mancini’s was brought forward after the FA Cup final defeat to Wigan Athletic in May 2013 and he was subsequently sacked. This act from an executive led by Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the chairman, may offer a precedent, though a sacking would occur only if City’s slump continues. At Pellegrini’s appraisal he may be asked about his training methods and approach to tactics and formations because although the Chilean is popular among the squad there is a view these areas of his management can be stale. The manager is under renewed scrutiny after City’s 2-1 defeat at Palace left the champions in fourth place, nine points behind Chelsea, who have played a match fewer, and in a fight to secure Champions League qualification; fifth-placed Liverpool are seven points behind. As City prepare to face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday there is no mood to consider Pellegrini’s future now. The hierarchy are conscious that victory would leapfrog City over their crosstown rivals and maintain the gap to Liverpool to seven points at least, with only six matches remaining. Yet there is concern after only two wins in the last six league matches, a sequence that has all but mathematically ended hopes of retaining the Premier League title. Soriano and Begiristain are thought to be more secure in their positions, with each recognising the urgent need to refresh the squad with younger elite players. Yet at Soriano’s appraisal he may have to address how Uefa’s financial fair play sanctions have affected the campaign. Begiristain is responsible for a failed transfer strategy that has seen £119.9m spent on 11 players of whom only Martín Demichelis and Fernandinho can be said to be any kind of success.

In fact, the king passed a law against playing it.

In 1681 it became an official sport in England. By the 1800s, people throughout the country played soccer. By the 18th century, upper-class boys played it at schools. Its popularity grew among all English people. At a meeting held in an English school in 1843, the first rules were suggested. In 1863 the heads of English soccer teams met in London to agree on some official rules. They organized an English football association . By 1871 all of the English clubs were following these rules.

Now, let's translate the given options and understand their meaning: 1. Option A: എഫ്.ബി.ഐ (FBI) 2. Option B: തമിഴ്‌നാട്ടിലുള്ള (In Tamil Nadu) 3. Option C: ടെക്സാസിലെ (In Texas) 4. Option D: ഡാളസിലെ (In Dallas) From the given context and options, it seems that the location would make sense as a replacement for the <MASK> token, as a location insertion would maintain the rest of the paragraph's continuity. Considering that, 'FBI'- Option A, seems out of context. Also, Beverly Oliver, the person mentioned in the text, is linked with the U.S., and among the options, Tamil Nadu (B) is in India, Texas (C) and Dallas (D) are in the U.S. Dallas is a city in the state of Texas, so to provide a more specific location, the most suitable replacement here would be 'Dallas'. So the best choice would be Option D. Output: ഡാളസിലെ (In Dallas)."},{"instruction":"The answer to the question: What is the full name of the man who was the nephew of Tyrconnel? is inside the article: Until its acceptance by the National Trust, Belton House was always in the ownership of the family of its builder, though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass sideways and sometimes through the female line.

What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","output":"The first step of the process is the transportation of blood to the kidneys through the renal arteries. This is a crucial initial stage as the kidneys are responsible for filtering out waste products, excess water, and other substances from the blood. Renal arteries are branches of the abdominal aorta, and they play a significant role in delivering oxygen-rich blood to the nephrons, which are the functional units of the kidneys. Once the oxygen-rich blood reaches the kidneys, it goes through a complex series of steps that primarily focus on waste filtration and regulation of various elements, such as electrolytes, fluids, and blood pressure within the body. It is through these processes that the kidneys are able to maintain the overall health and functioning of several bodily systems. The renal arteries enter the kidneys and branch into smaller arterioles and capillaries that reach the nephrons, where the actual filtration process occurs. Each nephron consists of a glomerulus and renal tubules. The glomerulus is a network of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that enable the filtration process, while the renal tubules help reabsorb useful substances and maintain the correct electrolyte levels. As blood flows through the glomerulus, waste products, excess water, and other substances get filtered out from the blood and enter the renal tubules. This filtration process is passive and driven by the pressure difference between the blood in the glomerulus and the fluid in the renal tubules. Substances that the body needs like glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes are reabsorbed back into the blood in the renal tubules, while waste products and excess water are combined to form urine. This urine then passes through the renal pelvis and enters the ureter, ultimately being collected in the bladder until it is removed from the body during urination. Throughout this process, the kidneys are constantly working to maintain the overall balance and health of the body. They regulate electrolytes, manage fluid balance, and help maintain optimal blood pressure. So, in conclusion, the first step of this vital process is the transportation of blood to the kidneys through the renal arteries, the starting point of waste filtration and regulation of numerous essential body functions."},{"instruction":"Background: Expose is an American Latin freestyle vocal group. Primarily consisting of lead vocalists Jeanette Jurado, Ann Curless, and Gioia Bruno, the group achieved much of their success between 1984 and 1993, becoming the first group to have four top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart from its debut album, including the 1988 #1 hit \\"Seasons Change\\". In March 2015, Billboard magazine named the group the eighth most-successful girl group of all-time. The group was popular in dance clubs, mainstream Top 40 and adult contemporary charts in the United States. Context: During the recording of the group's first studio album Exposure, the personnel of the group changed. Reports vary based on the source. According to People magazine, one of the original singers quit while two of the girls were fired midway through the recording of the first album, but according to Billboard, all three were fired. Arista records felt that the three original singers lacked star potential. Martinee states that he made the decision himself to replace the three girls, while Miller maintains it was all their choice, and Jurado confirms that Lorenzo wanted to leave. Shortly thereafter, Casanas pursued a solo career and Lorenzo pursued other ambitions; they were replaced by Jeanette Jurado and Gioia Bruno. Miller began a solo career; she was replaced by Ann Curless. Lorenzo returned to the dance charts with the Vendetta Records releases \\"I Wanna Know\\" in 1988, and \\"Stop Me if I Fall in Love\\" in 1990, while Laurie Miller released the 12\\" single \\"Parallels\\" on Atlantic Records and a second single \\"Love is a Natural Magical Thing\\" on Meet Me In Miami Records. Laurie evolved into a headline performer frequently showcasing her talents on cruises with a more intimate jazz style, and formed her own entertainment company called Xica productions. Casanas later resurfaced as a solo artist (Sandee) and released a solo album, Only Time Will Tell, which garnered the club hits \\"You're The One\\", \\"Love Desire\\", and the Clivilles & Cole-produced bassline-heavy hit \\"Notice Me\\". She continued to tour actively in dance clubs and freestyle shows, until her death on December 15, 2008, of a seizure at the age of 46. All three original members: Casanas, Lorenzo and Miller later contributed vocals on songs on the Miami group Will to Power's eponymous 1988 debut album. Gioia Bruno also provided lead vocals on Will to Power's 2004 album, Spirit Warrior. Question: Were there other details of these changes?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there were other details surrounding the personnel changes in Exposé during the recording of their first studio album, Exposure. The process of changing members was not a smooth one, and the reasons for the change are somewhat contradicting. Arisa Records mentioned that the three original singers (Alejandra Lorenzo, Sandra Casanas, and Laurie Miller) lacked star potential, which was one of the reasons for seeking replacements. However, according to Lewis A. Martinee, the group's producer, he made the decision to replace the three original members. On the other hand, Alejandra Lorenzo claims that she wanted to leave the group of her own accord. When the changes occurred, Sandra Casanas, Alejandra Lorenzo, and Laurie Miller were replaced by Jeanette Jurado, Gioia Bruno, and Ann Curless, respectively. These new members went on to achieve significant success with the group, contributing to its status as one of the most successful girl groups of all time. Apart from the conflicting accounts on the reasons behind the change, it is important to note the successful solo careers some of the original and new members launched afterward. Alejandra Lorenzo returned to the dance charts with hits like \\"I Wanna Know\\" and \\"Stop Me if I Fall in Love.\\" Laurie Miller released singles and went on to become a headline performer with a jazz style, forming her own entertainment company, Xica Productions. Similarly, Sandra Casanas, known by her stage name Sandee, had a successful solo career, releasing an album titled Only Time Will Tell. She scored club hits like \\"You're The One,\\" \\"Love Desire,\\" and \\"Notice Me.\\" Sadly, she passed away in December 2008 at the age of 46. Additionally, all three original members contributed vocals on songs on Miami group Will to Power's 1988 debut album. Gioia Bruno, one of the new members in Exposé, also provided lead vocals on Will to Power's 2004 album, Spirit Warrior. In conclusion, while the reasons for the personnel changes in Exposé during their first album's recording may be somewhat murky, the impacts of these changes are clear. The group's success, as well as the solo careers and collaborations that ensued, highlights the talents of all the involved vocalists and their continued impact on the music industry."},{"instruction":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who noted the building's resemblance and \\"strong architectural kinship\\" to the Romney Presbyterian Church? ? The interior and exterior of Literary Hall remain largely intact. At two stories, the building is tall in its proportion and incorporates elements from both early American and Victorian styles, which were common in academic buildings built during this period.Architectural historian S.

Also, sorry for the caps.) Starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that's all the more annoying for talking nonsense, it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama. That's badly but accurately put. We know space travel is a risky enterprise. There's a complicated system with a lot of potential for malfunctions, radiation, stress-related symptoms etc, and unexpected things are bound to happen in largely unknown environments. They knew stuff could go wrong. In fact, stuff had gone wrong. It's called learning. Granted, Appollo 11 wasn't safe by today's standards and there was immense political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive. Assorted mistakes/comments I hadn't even to look up: 1) Nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong. Well duh. That's what I would've done. It was the apex of a propaganda war, after all. 2) NASA gives green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 will probably blow up. (This is \\"only\\" implicit, though.) Yeah, that's why they let people and press watch in almost-real-time. 3) The capsule ejection wouldn't work. Like it didn't work the time a chimp was in it. The one that survived? It was a test launch and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute. There's a video of it, you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere. 4) One interviewed guy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair part of Florida. I can only assume it was meant as a hyperbole, 'cause if not, I'm just aghast how he could get it so wrong. 5) The technology then was primitive compared to today's standards. Actually, relatively primitive software and hardware is used even today, the reason being that it must not crash. It's even worse for spacecraft, because their computers must be built of comparably large components that aren't that susceptible to radiation. (And the craft itself must be pilotable manually anyway, so a complex steering system like the B2's wouldn't do.) What's with the fact that they were using \\"TV screens\\" rather than \\"computer screens\\"? It's the same damn technology. Actually TV monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definition. 6) \\"If that object wasn't part of the rocket, it could be only one thing.\\" We see where this is going. Apart from the fact that the statement is wrong, who says it wasn't a rocket part? At least an interviewee clears up that if a thing is flying and you don't know what it is, it's by definition an Unidentified Flying Object. 7) The voice-over as well as some misquotes make it seem as though the lander's radiation foil was actually its hull. Which would make it thinner than a space suit. 8) Neil Armstrong's near death during a practice flight is footage I can appreciate; I hadn't seen it before. As I said, any piece of manifest technology can go wrong, especially if it's not been tested sufficiently on account of being, you know, unprecedented. 9)The trajectory discrepancy of the descending lander (due to irregularities in the Moon's density) was at no time acutely life-threatening. Neither was the \\"fifteen seconds of fuel left\\", which was, in fact, \\"fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to abort the mission and returning to the command module\\". 10) A \\"catastrophic chain of events\\" usually results in catastrophe. I really don't know how to put it any simpler. This, however, is a prime example of the rhetoric used. 11) There's a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid, followed by the voice-over telling us that the reason for this strange behavior \\"can now be revealed\\". Turns out, he was walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid. Hilarious stuff. 12) It's mentioned that during re-entry, all contact was lost. This is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time as it's impossible to circumvent with contemporary technology. Again, the gravity of this is implicit, but very purposely so. 13) There was never a shuttle lost in space itself, while the voice-over presents this \\"fact\\" as evidence that Appollo 11 was a pile of crap. Appollo 13 was a near-loss, but the two real disasters happened during liftoff and re-entry, respectively. In any case, comparing shuttles to Saturn rockets is somehow ... well, okay, just plain stupid. Even ignoring that, the successful shuttle missions seem to not have been deemed of interest to the audience. 14) What the hell's up with the UFO? Even in the context of the movie, it makes no sense. Unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes, aimed at a specific audience (which seems to include people with next to no understanding of either history, science, or rhetorics). Even the point of the movie is somewhat obscure. Catch-phrases like \\"covered up until now\\", \\"publically revealed here for the first time\\", come up, but the film doesn't place any blame or offer a lesson or anything, which could be expected of a film so emotionally done. In the good old tradition of sensationalism, there are numerous interview shots and recording fragments that are often out of context or with people that we know nothing about except \\"NASA scientist\\". Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before the endeavor? Fancy that. What does this have to do with the point of the movie again? Oh yeah, which point. In summary, in addition to being either willfully or incompetently inaccurate, it's not even good entertainment. And believe me, I'm a guy who enjoys his crappy documentaries; this film isn't funny, witty, quaint, it's nothing. Now, what is this review like?

I like to dye my hair black a few times a year but my wife prefers it blonde like hers. I think she likes the pick from the following. (1). blonde hair matching.; (2). black hair matching.;","output":"It was a sunny Saturday morning, and as I glanced at my reflection in the bathroom mirror, I realized it was time to dye my hair again. The semi-permanent black dye was starting to fade, exposing my naturally blonde locks. My wife, Linda, was sitting on the bed, flipping through the latest issue of Vogue, and peering over occasionally at my dyeing session. I knew she secretly preferred my hair blonde, just like hers. It made sense to her, in our own unspoken wavelength of understanding, that having matching hair colors meant we were connected on a deeper level. This specific preference of hers was never really an issue, since we were open with each other about how we felt about little things like this. We have always believed that strong relationships grow from being honest and understanding of each other's opinions, desires, and peculiarities. Our shared love for fashion meant that we would both evolve our styles – sometimes independently, sometimes in cohesion –needing to experiment and redefine our own looks regularly. We both jokingly called these phases our style metamorphosis. The confusion began when she hadn't been clear on her inclination on whether she preferred matching our hair choice as black or as blonde. For a few months now, she had been very cryptic while discussing how she wanted us to look. One day, she’d say she liked the way we looked with both of us having black hair, but on another, she seemed to be more drawn to the idea of the blonde-haired couple that we used to be when we first met. In search of clarity, as I was mixing the dye in a small bowl, I decided to relaunch the topic. \\"Linda, I know this is a tricky subject for you, but I would really love to understand your preference in how our hair should match. Should we maintain the black hair, or return to both of us being blonde?\\" Surprisingly, Linda put the magazine down and gazed at our wedding picture hanging on the wall. She seemed to be lost in thought, maybe even a bit nostalgic. She turned to me with a gentle smile and responded, \\"You know what? I think I've made up my mind. Let's go back to both being blonde.\\" From her expression, I could tell she had been reminiscing on the earlier days of our relationship when we first met – a time when our matching blonde hair seemed to mirror more than just our physical appearances. It felt like we were synchronized, harmoniously unified even before we realized we were in love. I wiped off the black dye from my hands and smiled back at her, feeling a sense of relief. It was time to embrace change – just like how we had done so many times in the past. We decided to spend the rest of the day shopping for the perfect blonde hair dyes for both of us, and later in the evening, we had a small hair dyeing celebration in the comfort of our home. As we worked our way through the application and finally rinsed the dye away, we laughed and joked about our adventures in fashion and self-expression. It was energizing to see how just a simple color change could trigger a renewed connection between us and rekindle memories from the past. Ultimately, our love wasn't about matching hair colors or being the most stylish couple in town. It was about constantly rediscovering who we were, both as individuals and as an inseparable duo. And for us, that journey was more than enough to keep our bond strong and ever-evolving, no matter the color of our hair."},{"instruction":"Where do platypus females construct their homes for egg laying?

The hypothesis, on the other hand, posits that insects are the majority of the population at the wooden bridges and reed beds. Assuming that the premise is true, it is not automatically guaranteed that the hypothesis is equally true. This is because the premise and the hypothesis are dealing with slightly different variables. The premise is focused on setting an environmental backdrop, addressing the physical aspects of this environment and highlighting the presence of bird and water life. However, it does not delve into a closer evaluation of the smaller fauna that inhabits the area, specifically the insect population. The hypothesis is more focused on a fundamental aspect of the ecosystem that is not explicitly addressed in the premise — the population of insects. Insects are a crucial part of any ecosystem and are indeed often abundant near water and reed beds. However, without concrete information correlating the premise to the insect population, it's not possible to definitively conclude the hypothesis is also true. The argument could be more solid if some linkage was established between the premise and the hypothesis, for example, if the premise mentioned anything about the biodiversity or the insect population in that area specifically. In conclusion, based on the information given, if the premise is true, it does not necessarily follow that the hypothesis is also true. The conclusion about the insect population requires additional supporting evidence not provided in the premise. A careful and comprehensive ecological study of the specific area in question would be needed to accurately evaluate and confirm the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Q:This is a correct answer to the following question about Languages of Mali.

There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city. - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - The Sioux are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America. The term can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation's many language dialects. The Sioux comprise three major divisions based on language divisions: the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota. - The Territory of Dakota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 2, 1861, until November 2, 1889, when the final extent of the reduced territory was split and admitted to the Union as the states of North and South Dakota. - The South Dakota Department of Transportation is a state government organization in charge of maintaining public roadways of the U.S. state of South Dakota . South Dakota has 82,447 miles of highways , roads and streets ; 5,905 bridges . The SD DOT is responsible for 7,830 miles of the roadway system . The DOT budgets roughly 15,700,000.00 for winter snow and ice removal year . The Department of Transportation was formerly known as the South Dakota Department of Highways . What is the relationship between 'south dakota department of transportation' and 'pierre'? A:","output":"The relationship between the 'South Dakota Department of Transportation' and 'Pierre' is that Pierre is the state capital of South Dakota, and the South Dakota Department of Transportation is a state government organization responsible for maintaining public roadways in the state of South Dakota.

McQuaid reveals his interest in speaking to Armstrong in bid to improve drug testing. Article:","output":"Title: Chris Froome Leads the Way in a New Era of Tour de France: A Fight Against Doping Chris Froome, the British professional road racing cyclist, is currently leading the prestigious Tour de France, marking the first edition of the race since American legend Lance Armstrong famously admitted to doping last January. In these trying times for the sport, many have looked to this year's race as a new chapter in cycling history, and one where the focus should be on the rigorous attempts being made to eradicate doping. In light of recent events, the current president of Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), Pat McQuaid, has come forward to insist that his organization is not responsible for any wrongdoings linked to the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs. As the head of the sport's governing body, his role is crucial in fostering a shift of culture towards ethical practices within the world of cycling. McQuaid, aware of the impact and significance of Armstrong's confession, has revealed his interest in speaking to the disgraced cyclist in an effort to improve the efficiency and accuracy of drug testing processes. Armstrong's insight into the doping schemes which he himself has participated in would be invaluable in the ongoing efforts to combat this issue. The Armstrong Saga, as it has come to be known, encapsulates a dark period in the sport, when multiple Tour de France winners and cycling champions doped to enhance their achievements. Armstrong, losing his seven titles, became the poster child for the doping culture, with his admission not only exposing his personal wrongdoings but also uncovering an underlying issue within the sport. Fast forward to 2021, and Chris Froome is painting an entirely different picture. The 36-year-old athlete, competing for the Israel Start-Up Nation team, has demonstrated incredible determination and focus, earning him the top spot for now. His continued success in the event is a beacon of hope and a testament to the sport's strides towards a new era of fair competition. McQuaid's willingness to engage with Armstrong and tackle the doping problem head on reveals a determination to learn from past mistakes, holds those accountable, and seek innovative solutions. This renewed commitment to transparency and integrity will undoubtedly prove crucial to ongoing efforts to ensure a clean sport for future generations of cyclists. As Chris Froome continues to dominate the competition and lead the Tour de France, the cycling community can take solace in the fact that his accomplishments – and those of his rivals – are the result of relentless hard work, unparalleled perseverance, and an unwavering commitment to clean competition. In light of the Armstrong scandal, these values have taken on new importance and will be upheld as symbols of the sport's resilience and determination to distance itself from the doping era. To summarize, as the 2021 Tour de France progresses with Chris Froome at the helm, the sport is undoubtedly moving towards a brighter, cleaner future. The UCI, with Pat McQuaid's guidance and Armstrong's potential contribution, is taking active steps to reduce doping incidents and promote fair competition for all participants. In the wake of the Armstrong revelations, this new chapter in the history of professional cycling is a welcome and necessary evolution that fans and athletes alike will be eagerly embracing."},{"instruction":"Goalkeeper Simon Mignolet who signed for Liverpool in 2013 has international caps for which country????","output":"Goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who signed for Liverpool in 2013, has earned international caps for Belgium. Born in Sint-Truiden, Belgium on March 6, 1988, Mignolet began his footballing journey with his hometown club Sint-Truidense V.V. in their youth setup.

A:","output":"Brian Massumi, born in 1956, is a highly respected Canadian social theorist, writer, and philosopher who gained significant recognition for his English-language translations of \\"A Thousand Plateaus,\\" a seminal 1980 philosophy book written by two notable French authors – Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was a French philosopher widely acclaimed for his work in the field of continental philosophy, influencing various subjects such as literature, art, and social theory. His work traverses a broad spectrum of philosophical themes, including metaphysics, aesthetics, epistemology, and ethics. Among his most significant works are \\"Difference and Repetition\\" (1968) and \\"The Logic of Sense\\" (1969), which address issues of identity, representation, and language. Deleuze often collaborated with other intellectuals, the most notable partnership being with Guattari. Félix Guattari (1930-1992) was a psychoanalyst, political militant, and philosopher who co-founded the École Freudienne de Paris with psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan in 1964. Guattari's work delved into various intellectual disciplines, such as linguistics, anthropology, and political theory. He developed the concept of \\"schizoanalysis,\\" a critical method aimed at challenging the traditional psychoanalytic view of mental health and illness. Guattari is also known for his work as an activist for various leftist causes throughout his life. The collaboration between Deleuze and Guattari commenced in the late 1960s, resulting in a profound friendship that generated innovative theoretical contributions to contemporary philosophy, political thought, and cultural criticism. Their joint works include \\"Anti-Oedipus\\" (1972) and \\"A Thousand Plateaus\\" (1980), both of which form two volumes of their magnum opus, \\"Capitalism and Schizophrenia.\\" These works are emblematic of their profound critique of psychoanalysis, capitalism, and various societal structures. \\"A Thousand Plateaus\\" adopts a non-linear, experimental approach to writing, incorporating a rhizomatic structure that allows for multiple points of entry and interpretation. This innovative style reflects the book's core philosophical themes, such as multiplicity, deterritorialization, and the emphasis on becoming rather than being. The book's overarching objective is to present an alternative vision of thought that fosters creativity, freedom, and resistance to various forms of oppression. Brian Massumi's English translation of \\"A Thousand Plateaus\\" played a pivotal role in bringing the groundbreaking work of Deleuze and Guattari to a broader audience, thus amplifying its impact on various academic disciplines. In addition to his translation work, Massumi has made substantial contributions to fields such as semiotics, cultural theory, and political philosophy.

The two sides met ahead of a promised labor shutdown of the Nigerian oil industry. In solidarity with protesters, the oil union has threatened to stop production if the government does not reinstate subsidies that will return the cost of fuel to previous levels. A decision to halt production would affect global oil prices; Nigeria is the world's eighth-largest exporter. Throngs of protesters have rallied to demand government accountability and a return of fuel subsidies ended on January 1, a move that doubled gas prices and sent the cost of other goods skyrocketing. \\"This is not the first time the subsidy has been removed in Nigeria. For two decades, every single government has done this,\\" said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the nation's finance minister. \\"There is a very short memory. It has always resulted in resistance and a strike and so on.\\" A deal had not been reached to avert the shutdown as talks stretched into early Sunday. While negotiations remained ongoing, one union leader said oil workers will resume their strike Monday. Earlier, labor unions urged protesters to take a break from their five-day strike Saturday and Sunday to stock up on food and water supplies. Stores and supermarkets shut down as part of the national strike were set to reopen over the weekend to allow protesters to get supplies, said Folorunso Oginni, chairman of the nation's oil union, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria. Despite the strike suspension, the deadline to shut down oil production is still in effect unless the government and labor unions reach an agreement, he said. The protests -- dubbed \\"Occupy Nigeria\\" -- have galvanized the continent's most populous nation. Nigerians accuse their leaders of corruption and misusing oil revenues in a country where most citizens battle grinding poverty. The government has said the removal will free funds to improve the country's infrastructure. But there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure -- Nigeria is regularly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world. \\"It is to now to try to move this forward regain the people's trust. They cannot say because of mistakes in the past the country should not move forward,\\" the finance minister said Friday. In addition to the protests, the government faces another crisis -- religious attacks that have heightened fears of sectarian violence in parts of the country. CNN's Vladimir Duthiers, Kim Chakanetsa and Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.

This could make the prices of fuel go up all over the world because Nigeria is one of the places that gives lots of fuel to other countries. The government says they'll try to fix some of the problems, but many people don't trust them to do it because the government has sometimes been dishonest.

Some of these fish will be caught and sold, ending up in aquariums around the world. Is the industry putting populations of the fish at risk? Scientists who have studied the Big Island fishery say it is well managed. Rules put in place more than 15 years ago have helped to protect the fish. Along 35% of the coastline, for example, fish collecting is banned. Two years ago, the state cut the number of fish species for the aquarium trade from hundreds to just 40. Conservationist Robert Wintner objects to the findings. Wintner, who owns snorkel shops across Hawaii, started the Snorkel Bob Foundation to protect the island's coral reefs . He says he simply doesn't see yellow tang in the protected areas. \\"There should be millions of them,\\" he says. \\"Where are they?\\" Wintner says people believe the numbers in reports. But few people have actually dived into the coral reefs to see for themselves how many fish can be found there. According to Wintner, the coral reefs along the coast should be filled with yellow tang, but they are \\"virtually empty\\".

According to the Dictionary of American Hymnology \\"Amazing Grace\\" is John Newton's spiritual autobiography in verse.In 1725, Newton was born in Wapping, a district in London near the Thames. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience. As a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \\"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\\" His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \\"Polly\\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love.

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in... answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl?

It shows a bust view of a single figure, modeled on Diego Velázquez's Portrait of Innocent X. Bacon applies forceful, expressive brush strokes, and places the figure within a glass cage structure, behind curtain-like drapery. This gives the effect of a man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings, screaming into an airless void. Head VI was the first of Bacon's paintings to reference Velázquez, whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of \\"screaming popes\\", a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works. Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in Bacon's work. The hanging object, which may be a light switch or curtain tassel, can be found even in his late paintings. The geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985–86 masterpiece Study for a Self-Portrait—Triptych. Head VI was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London, in a showing organised by one of the artist's early champions, Erica Brausen. At the time, Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist, best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which made him the enfant terrible of British art. Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics; John Russell, later Bacon's biographer, at the time dismissed it as a cross between \\"an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince-nez who has come to a bad end\\". In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the \\"shock of the picture, when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was indescribable. It was everything unpardonable. The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of Bacon's most original strokes.\\" Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from Bacon's unusually productive 1949–50 period, and one of Bacon's finest popes.

This process often involves physical motions with objects, such as moving them, arranging them in a certain way, mixing them, shaking them, etc. Q: Create giant lawn art canvas. A:","output":"Steps to create a giant lawn art canvas: 1. Understand the Task: This task is asking to create large-sized artwork, specifically on a lawn. It means turning a lawn into a canvas where you can make art. 2. Required Materials: To perform this, you will need marking paint, several stencils of different shapes and sizes (depending on what type of art you want to make), ropes (to guide you in creating straight lines or specific shapes), and a considerable amount of physical energy. 3. The Procedure: Step 1: Start with a clean lawn. Clean the lawn area of any objects or debris that could interfere with your art. Step 2: Sketch your design on a paper. It's easier to work when you have a reference to look at. Step 3: Use ropes and stencils to mark the outline of your sketch on the lawn. Depending on the complexity of your design, you may need to use multiple ropes and keep adjusting their position. Step 4: Once satisfied with the design, start filling the design with marking paint. You can use different colors to make it more vibrant. Step 5: Always start painting from the farthest point from your exit to avoid walking over fresh paint. Step 6: After painting, give it some time to dry. Step 7: Once dry, your giant lawn art canvas is ready to be admired. 4. Using the Guidelines: This solution makes use of physical knowledge about the world. It involves performing physical tasks such as cleaning the lawn, marking and painting the lawn, which fits the requirement described in the guidelines. To ensure the desired outcome of the task, remember to consider the safety measures while carrying out the process—like using non-toxic paint, wearing gloves and masks during painting, and being cautious while moving around newly painted areas."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Reasoning: It is not possible to tell the exact number of grains of sand on Earth due to several factors. Firstly, the vast and continuously changing nature of Earth's terrain, including beaches, deserts, and riverbeds, means that the total amount of sand is always in flux. Erosion, weathering, and human activities can continually transform rocks and minerals into sand, while existing sand can be compacted, washed away, or transported to other locations. Secondly, the granular and microscopic nature of sand makes it challenging to quantify precisely, as even a small sample could contain billions of individual grains that are difficult to count accurately. Lastly, the definition of sand varies, as it consists of numerous materials, such as rock, mineral, and organic particles that can range in size from 0.0625 mm to 2 mm in diameter. This variability in composition and size makes it nearly impossible to establish a universally accepted standard for determining the number of sand grains globally. Consequently, it is not possible to tell the exact number of grains of sand on Earth."},{"instruction":"What is the solution?

First, we have the equation: 62 * s + 10339 - 13873 = 0 Now, we need to move the numbers (10339 and 13873) to the other side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 10339 from both sides and then add 13873 to both sides. This gives us: 62 * s = 13873 - 10339 Now we can calculate the right side of the equation: 13873 - 10339 = 3534 So now the equation looks like this: 62 * s = 3534 Now, we need to find the value of \\"s\\".

The horrifying side effect, however, is that the subjects lose their ability to differentiate reality from illusions leading to tragic accidents and mental instability. Ellen's curiosity takes a dark turn when she learns that her sister, Jennifer, was one of the test subjects. Feeling a personal connection to the story, she decides to uncover how her sister was involved in the program and expose the government's unethical activities. Constantly tormented by nightmares of an enigmatic figure named \\"Lazarus,\\" Ellen feels the psychological effects of her investigation. Additionally, her professional and personal life starts to crumble as she isolates herself from her friends and family, and her reputation takes a hit due to her obsession with the project. Aided by a former government scientist, Dr. Robert Anderson, who worked on the project, Ellen manages to uncover a list of the subjects and their current whereabouts. Together, they visit each subject to gather information on the conspiracy and see if they can find any leads on Jennifer's location. While conducting their interviews, they begin to notice a pattern - a mysterious black car was present during each subject's tormenting incidents. Furthermore, Ellen learns that Jennifer was last seen near a remote woodland area. They decide to drive there, unaware that they are being followed. Ellen spots the black car parked near an abandoned cabin in the woods and concludes that Jennifer might have had an accident with the mysterious car. Going against Dr. Anderson's advice, she enters the cabin. Inside, she discovers a dark room with grotesque images of all the test subjects, including herself and Jennifer. Suddenly, in a chilling twist, Ellen experiences the horrifying realization that the enigmatic figure behind the car and her nightmares is Dr. Anderson himself. The former scientist who sought to help her was actually orchestrating the crashes to silence the subjects and cover his tracks. Confronting her own fears and demons, Ellen fights Dr. Anderson and manages to escape. The movie climaxes with a high-speed car chase through the woods until Ellen's car crashes into a tree, and Dr. Anderson catches up with her. Injured and in a state of panic, Ellen manages to record a confession from Dr. Anderson before the police arrive at the scene and arrest him. The story ends with Ellen recovering from her injuries, her career restored due to her revealing investigation, and her newfound purpose to stand up against corruption. Determined to find her sister, Ellen's journey continues into the sequel, where she fights for justice and uncovering the truth about her sister's fate, while battling the psychological trauma from the events she has endured. \\"The Road Less Traveled\\" will be a thrilling movie that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats while exploring themes of conspiracy, secret experiments, and the consequences of obsession.

Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work. The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

The dark cloud of suspicion surrounding the alleged serial killer Vincent Groves has once again gathered momentum, as authorities in Denver turn to advanced DNA technology to unravel the mysteries of numerous cold cases dating back nearly three decades. Through the diligent efforts of forensic experts, these long-standing unsolved murder cases may finally be linked to Groves, providing a degree of closure for the families of the victims. Step 2: Explain who Vincent Groves is and what he is accused of. (Vincent Groves was a convicted murderer, and police suspect him of being involved in various killings in the Denver area.) Vincent Groves, now deceased, was a convicted murderer who served time in prison for two distinct killings. However, over the years, law enforcement officials have grown increasingly convinced that Groves is responsible for the deaths of many more victims in the Denver area. Step 3: Discuss the role of DNA technology in solving the cold cases.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera. I didn't know it at the time, but at that moment Dylan Maxwell was sitting in front of a wall of monitors, laughing his ass off. Question: Who was standing under the surveillance camera? Options: A.

But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all. So with dead, smelly fish in mind, I persuaded my friend Shan to pick one up when he was down at the Saturday Farmer's Market. He returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid. Shad has even more bones than other fish and you'll never see it featured on any cooking show (except maybe Iron Chef, where the disgusting and unusual seems to be standard). It took me all day to thaw out the fish in the lounge sink?#8364;?an activity which elicited howls of complaint from the guys trying to watch TV. According to the above context, answer the following question. Who returned from the Farmer's Market with a four-pound fish? Answer:","output":"Shan returned from the Farmer's Market with a four-pound fish."},{"instruction":"First question: What's a good workout to gain strength and get a ripped body? Second question: What is the best workout regime to get ripped body? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from the following. --no; --yes;","output":"The two questions posed share similar goals but have subtle differences. First question: What's a good workout to gain strength and get a ripped body? The core goal of this query is to determine a workout plan that focuses on developing both strength and a more defined, muscular physique. A well-rounded and comprehensive strength and hypertrophy program would be ideal. Here is an outline of an effective workout plan to achieve these goals: 1. Focus on compound exercises: Compound exercises work multiple muscle groups simultaneously and stimulate the release of muscle-building hormones. Some key compound exercises include squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, pull-ups, rows, and weighted lunges. 2. Incorporate progressive overload: This involves gradually increasing the weight or resistance in your workouts to continually challenge your muscles and stimulate growth. 3. Utilize different rep ranges: Mixing different rep ranges, such as using high rep ranges (12-15) for hypertrophy and lower rep ranges (5-8) for strength, will allow you to work the muscles in multiple ways and optimize results. 4. Pay attention to rest periods: For strength-based workouts, you rest for longer periods between sets (3-5 minutes) to allow for optimal recovery. While focusing on hypertrophy, you may lower the rest period to 30-60 seconds. 5. Include functional workouts: Add circuit training, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) sessions, or plyometrics to your routine to improve overall fitness, burn fat, and reveal muscle definition. 6. Proper nutrition and recovery: Emphasize a clean, protein-rich diet to support muscle growth and recovery. Proper sleep (7-9 hours per night) and actively prioritizing rest days are essential for achieving your goals. Second question: What is the best workout regime to get a ripped body? This question is more focused on the aesthetics of having a defined and chiseled physique. The main goal of this query is to determine an optimal workout plan for achieving muscle definition and low body fat. Here is an outline of a suitable workout regime: 1. Prioritize cardiovascular exercises: These exercises help burn fat and reveal the underlying muscle tone. Aim to include at least 150 minutes of moderate cardio or 75 minutes of vigorous cardio weekly. 2. Circuit training and HIIT workouts: High-intensity workouts elevate one's heart rate, encourage calorie burn even after the workout session, and enhance metabolism. Ideally, include these sessions 2-3 times a week in your routine. 3. Resistance training: Incorporate resistance exercises to develop well-rounded, toned muscles. Focus mainly on high rep ranges (12-20) to stimulate muscle hypertrophy. Using primarily cables, dumbbells, and bodyweight exercises helps to increase muscle stamina and definition. 4. Core stability exercises: Enhance core stability and strength by integrating exercises targeting the abdominal and lower back muscles, such as planks, Russian twists, and leg raises. 5. Nutrition and hydration: Maintain a clean diet, focusing on consuming the right ratio of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Hydrate consistently through the day to support vitality and workout recovery. 6. Rest and recovery: Adequate rest is essential for muscle growth and fat loss, ensuring you do not hinder your efforts in the gym. Proper sleep should be prioritized, along with incorporating active recovery practices such as yoga or stretching. In conclusion, while both questions touch on the subject of achieving a ripped body, the first question emphasizes gaining strength in combination with a defined physique. On the other hand, the second query is solely focused on achieving a ripped and toned appearance. So, the answer is --no; they are not asking the same thing, but rather have related but distinct objectives."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true (see options at the end): The New York Red Bulls II are an American professional soccer team based in Harrison, New Jersey.

Movie title: Carnival of Souls Movie plot: While out for a drive, three girlfriends get into a car race with two boys. As the car chase takes them down backroads, they come to a bridge. Trying to get across it, the girls car ends up crashing through the side and the car sinks into the water.Some time afterward, a search party is brought out, but after several hours, there appears to be no sign of the car. However, things take a turn for the surprising, when one of the girls, Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss), emerges from the water, cold and shaken. Some people ask her questions, but she does not give any answers at that time.Some time afterward, Mary gets a job as an organ player in Utah. Before she leaves, she stops by the organ factory in town, and places on their organ for them. The place she is going to has an organ made from the same factory as well. When the Factory owner requests that Mary come back some time to play for them again, she claims she will not be returning.Mary then takes off on her trip. As she nears Salt Lake City, Utah, her vision is drawn to a dark pavilion lying back a ways towards the horizon. As she glances out the passenger side window, she is shocked to see a man staring in at her! Mary turns away and looks back, but the figure is soon gone. However, Mary is shocked again when the same figure appears on the road in front of her, causing her to drive off the road. Collecting herself, Mary gets back on the road, and heads towards Salt Lake City.Mary rooms at a residence, presided over by a woman named Mrs Thomas (Frances Feist). There is another person rooming at the house, a rather slimy warehouse worker named John Linden (Sidney Berger).After putting her things in her new residence, Mary goes off to the church to meet the Minister (Art Ellison). She practices on the organ, but after some time, stops and sits by a window to contemplate. The Minister asks her if she would like to take a ride with him to an appointment. Mary also makes a request that since the appointment is outside of town, if they could drive by the pavilion... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Carnival of Souls,\\" Mary passes the large, abandoned pavilion while she is on her way to Salt Lake City, Utah. After recently experiencing a traumatic car accident where her two friends are presumed dead, Mary secures a job as an organ player in Utah and sets out on her journey. As she nears Salt Lake City, her attention is drawn to the dark pavilion lying back a ways towards the horizon. It is during this time that she first encounters the mysterious figure, initially appearing on the passenger side of her car, and then later on the road in front of her, causing her to swerve off the road. After settling into her new residence and starting her job at the local church, Mary's curiosity regarding the pavilion remains. She asks the Minister (Art Ellison) to drive by the pavilion while accompanying him to an appointment outside of town. Her fascination with the pavilion suggests that it may be somehow connected to her recent eerie experiences and possibly the car accident. In summary, Mary passes the large, abandoned pavilion as she gets closer to Salt Lake City on her way to start her new job as an organ player. The pavilion plays a significant role in the movie, influencing the plot and contributing to the eerie and mysterious atmosphere that surrounds Mary's new life in Utah."},{"instruction":"Here are some keywords about a restaurant: name = Blue Spice, priceRange = less than £20, customer rating = low, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes.

By Alex Greig PUBLISHED: 21:17 EST, 12 December 2013 | UPDATED: 21:18 EST, 12 December 2013 The mother of a man who died in a prison fire after being sent back to Honduras despite receiving a stay of deportation is suing the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement for his death. Nelson Javier Avila-Lopez, 20, arrived in the U.S. seeking asylum in 2008 to escape gang members who were trying to recruit him. He was ordered deported when he missed a hearing in Immigration Court, but his attorney Joseph Huprich filed an emergency motion and Avila-Lopez was granted an emergency stay of deportation. Ana Lopez says","output":"her son's life was cut tragically short due to the negligence and misconduct of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to the lawsuit filed by Lopez and her attorney, multiple oversights and failures in the process ultimately led to the unnecessary death of her young son. Nelson Javier Avila-Lopez was initially placed in ICE detention upon arrival in the U.S., where he awaited his immigration court hearing. It was at this point, however, that the first failure occurred. Lopez claims that her son was not provided with adequate notice of his scheduled court date, thus resulting in his inadvertent absence from the hearing. Consequently, the court ordered his deportation based on his failure to appear. This unfortunate misunderstanding prompted Avila-Lopez's attorney, Joseph Huprich, to file an emergency motion for an immediate stay of deportation, highlighting the danger his client faced if returned to Honduras. Following a swift review of the case, the court granted the emergency stay, sparing Avila-Lopez from potential harm at the hands of his initial persecutors. Despite the court-ordered stay, due to what can only be considered as a grave error on the part of ICE detention facility staff, Avila-Lopez was deported back to Honduras. This horrifying instance of miscommunication led to him being imprisoned in a facility known for its dangerous and inhumane conditions. It was here that he lost his life in a prison fire, a tragedy that could have been easily avoided had ICE properly heeded the court's decision. Ana Lopez's lawsuit against ICE seeks justice for her son's wrongful death, holding the responsible parties accountable for their negligence in managing his case. She hopes the suit will expose the flaws in the immigration detention and deportation system, ultimately leading to increased transparency, improved communication, and enhanced safeguards to protect the lives of those held under ICE custody. In order to achieve these goals, Lopez and her attorney are requesting a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding her son's deportation and subsequent death. They are also calling for comprehensive reforms and increased oversight to ensure such tragedies are not repeated in the future. In the wake of the lawsuit, the case of Nelson Javier Avila-Lopez has attracted national attention and reignited an ongoing debate surrounding the treatment of asylum seekers in the United States. Advocates for change argue that this heartbreaking story is emblematic of a larger issue in the country's immigration system and are urging lawmakers to revisit the policies and practices that contributed to the untimely death of this young man seeking refuge from danger."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Skylar told her friends how much she disliked her math class that day.

Identify key elements of the statement: In the given claim, the key elements are \\"Rashi,\\" \\"United States ambassador,\\" \\"relations,\\" and \\"Israel.\\" We need to know who Rashi is, which United States ambassador the statement is referring to, and the context or time frame of this meeting. 2. Background research on Rashi: Rashi, when attributed to someone by the name, typically refers to a French medieval biblical commentator. Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki (1040-1105 CE), also known by the acronym \\"RASHI,\\" was a prominent Jewish scholar born in northern France. Considering the time frame, it is unlikely Rashi met with the United States ambassador as the United States was not established back then. 3.

At this moment (September 2021), the position is held by Thomas Nides. This information is subject to change over time. 4. Examine official sources and news reports: To validate the above claim regarding a meeting, one should consider looking at diplomatic sources (e.g., US Department of State), Israeli government press releases, and reliable news outlets for information about any such meetings involving the United States ambassador and the specific person named Rashi. Based on the historical context and the lack of additional information, the claim that Rashi met with the United States ambassador to discuss relations with Israel cannot be verified or confirmed.

But here's the current math: what's less than nothing? And if you do even less than nothing, at what point does it become completely counterproductive and silly? Have you noticed lately that real ideas are out of vogue? A serious GOP committee chairman makes a big — and, yes, controversial -- proposal to reform the tax code. Here's how his ultimate leader, House Speaker John Boehner, reacts when asked about parts of the plan: \\"Blah, blah, blah blah.\\" No kidding. The President, who once endorsed an idea to change the way Social Security benefits are calculated as a way to curb its growth, has now said \\"Never mind.\\" It won't be in his budget, for fear that his liberal base would desert him over it. Republicans, who started the year saying that immigration reform should be on the agenda, are now saying, as the speaker put it, the President can't be \\"trusted\\" to implement any serious measure. And Democrats say the President can't be trusted to do a trade agreement without angering the important constituency of organized labor, so bye-bye \\"fast track\\" trade bill. Bill to help veterans fails Truth is, it isn't about trust at all. It's about winning in 2014. And an important part of winning, it seems, is to paper over all dissent within your own party in order to present a united front to the voters. So the election will be this: Us or them? Obamacare or no Obamacare? Do you like me better? Do you like government? Do you like poor people or rich people? That's our debate -- the sum total of our big ideas right now. Not wanting to start any fights within your own party. Unity above all heading into the midterm elections. So maybe Congress should just close up shop and leave town because nothing is going to happen for the next nine months. Just turn off the lights. Both parties are making the same political calculation for the same reason: They can't afford to have any internal debate lest they seem less than united against the enemy. Turns out that the permanent campaign is still alive and well. Here's the glitch in this narrative: Voters, it turns out, actually want some solutions to problems. They want to see the deficit go down; they want to find a way to fix immigration. A majority (63%) is worried the country is on the wrong track. And, according to a new CBS/New York Times poll, eight in 10 Americans are fed up with Washington. Somehow, voters haven't gotten the message that Congress -- in its steadfast intent to accomplish nothing -- is just trying to appeal to them. But remember what happened to Mitt Romney's campaign. Romney lost for lots of reasons, but one of them was sticking too long to the assumption that if people were unhappy with the direction of the country and the other guy, that would be enough to win. It wasn't. The candidate mattered. And ideas mattered, too. The \\"big\\" GOP idea this time is to bash Obamacare, relentlessly, endlessly, in a continual loop. Sure, it's unpopular, but what about if it starts working for people? What if people are sick of hearing about it now that the website is working? And what if people are more inclined to mend it than end it? If Obamacare is the only trick in the bag, it might not be enough. Then there's the Democrats' income inequality refrain. It's not new, it can work, and sure, it unites the Democrats. But by taking almost everything of substance off the table, it's the President's legacy and record of achievement that gets compromised, along with the voters. The truth is this: It's a tight political fight. Polls right now show that the public, by a small 42%-39% margin, would back Republicans for office in the 2014 midterm elections. They're not thrilled with the President's job performance. They have soured on the President personally, and they can barely stomach the Congress. So what's the political solution? No substance, no ideas, no serious debate that might actually engage voters. Each side suits up, armed with its slogans and its bromides. And we inevitably re-elect the Congress we hate.

Article: There are three different ways to store fish. Two ways to store fish for future use are canning and freezing. Two other methods are drying and smoking. Today we have the first of the two reports describing, step by step, how to prepare dried fish. Begin with the fish that are just out of water. If the fish are small, leave their heads on. Cut off the heads if the fish are longer than twenty centimeters or weigh more than one hundred fifteen grams. Now clean the freshly caught fish. Cut off the scales and cut open the stomach. Remove everything inside. Then wash the fish in clean water and rub salt into them. Next, put the fish in a container with a solution of three hundred grams of salt and one liter of water. This will remove the blood from the meat. Keep the fish in the salt water for about thirty minutes. After that, wash them again in clean water. Next, put the fish in a solution that has more salt in the water. The water should be salty enough so that the fish float to the top. If the fish sink to the bottom of the container, add more salt to the water. Cover the container with a clean piece of wood. Place a heavy stone on the wood to hold it down. Leave the fish there for about six hours. After that remove them from the salt water and place them on a clean surface. Cover the fish with a clean piece of white cloth and let them dry. Another method of preparing fish is called dry salting. Wooden boxes or baskets are used for drying salting. After cleaning the fish, put a few of them on the bottom of the box or basket. Cover them with salt, then put more fish on top. Cover them also with salt. Continuing putting fish and salt in the container until it is full. Do not use too much salt when using the dry salting method. You should use one part salt to three parts fish. For example, if you have three kilograms of fish, you should use one kilogram of salt. Remove the fish after a week or ten days. Wash them in a mixture of water or a small amount of salt and let them dry. We have talked a lot about...

The Electoral College officials certified this ballot as a vote for John Edwards for president. The remaining nine electors cast ballots for John Kerry. All ten electors in the state cast ballots for John Edwards for vice president (John Edwards's name was spelled correctly on all ballots for vice president). This was the first time in U.S. history that an elector had cast a vote for the same person to be both president and vice president; another faithless elector in the 1800 election had voted twice for Aaron Burr, but under that electoral system only votes for the president's position were cast, with the runner-up in the Electoral College becoming vice president (and the second vote for Burr was discounted and re-assigned to Thomas Jefferson in any event, as it violated Electoral College rules). Q: What is different in comparison between the 1800 electoral system and the system in place in 2004?","output":"The United States presidential election systems in 1800 and 2004 had some significant differences, primarily in terms of how electors allocated their votes for president and vice president, as well as in the overall mechanics of the Electoral College process. 1. Voting for President and Vice President: In the 1800 electoral system, electors cast two votes for president without specifically indicating a vote for the vice president. The candidate who received the most electoral votes became president, while the runner-up became the vice president. This led to a situation where political rivals could end up occupying the top two executive positions, like in the election of 1796 when John Adams (Federalist) became president and Thomas Jefferson (Democratic-Republican) became his vice president. The 1800 election itself became problematic when Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, both Democratic-Republicans, received the same number of electoral votes, resulting in a tie. The 12th Amendment, ratified in 1804, addressed this issue by changing the electoral system so that electors cast distinct votes for president and vice president. By 2004, the electoral system reflected this change, with electors casting a vote for their party's nominated presidential candidate and a separate vote for the vice presidential candidate, avoiding potential ties and confusion. 2. Selection of Electors: In the 1800 election, state legislatures determined how electors would be chosen, with each state using its unique method. Some states held popular voting, while others used different systems or had their legislatures appoint electors directly. By 2004, all states used popular voting to choose electors, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska, which both used a modified district system to allocate electoral votes. Electors were typically chosen through a winner-take-all system in each state. 3. Role of Political Parties: In the 1800 election, the U.S. was just beginning to see the formation of organized political parties. The Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties were the two major factions at the time. Party nominations were informal – often determined by congressional caucuses – and there was no standardized method to nominate the presidential and vice presidential candidates. By 2004, the political landscape had evolved significantly, with a more formal structure for nominations in place, involving party primaries and conventions. The two major parties, the Democrats and Republicans, nominated their candidates as a presidential-vice presidential ticket. 4. Expansion of the Electorate: In the 1800 election, the voting population was limited to white, property-owning males, leading to a distinctly smaller electorate than in 2004. Over the years, constitutional amendments and civil rights legislations expanded voting rights to include non-property owners, former slaves, women, and other marginalized groups, which resulted in a more representative electorate in the 2004 election. In summary, the key differences between the United States presidential election systems in 1800 and 2004 include the method of voting for president and vice president (as a result of the 12th Amendment), the selection process for electors, the role and organization of political parties, and the expansion of the electorate to include a more diverse range of voters."},{"instruction":"Ringley Old Bridge is an ancient stone bridge in Kearsley near Bolton, England which crosses the River Irwell, linking Ringley with Stoneclough.

Ringley Old Bridge is an ancient stone bridge in Kearsley near Bolton, England. - This tells us the bridge is ancient and made of stone. However, it doesn't provide a specific construction date. 2. It crosses the River Irwell, linking Ringley with Stoneclough. - This tells us the purpose of the bridge, but not the construction date. 3.

It is a Grade II* structure, listed on 19 August 1986. - This tells us that the bridge was listed as a Grade II* structure on 19 August 1986, indicating that it is considered an important structure with significant historic interest. However, the listing date is not the same as the construction date. Given the information provided, we can't conclusively determine the exact construction date of Ringley Old Bridge.

Let's discuss and contrast the meanings of the word \\"come\\" in these two examples: 1. \\"Come out of the closet!\\": In this context, the word \\"come\\" functions as an imperative verb, which is a form of command or a request for someone to do something. Here, the speaker asks or urges someone to \\"come out\\" – literally, they are asking the person to leave an enclosed space such as a closet, but the phrase is often used figuratively, especially when referring to someone revealing their true identity, usually in the context of sexuality or LGBTQ+ matters. This idiomatic expression is conveying the idea of opening up about one's true identity, orientation, or desires, and it is a call to action for the listener to disclose their hidden truth. 2. \\"He comes from humble origins.\\": In this context, \\"comes\\" is used in its present simple form and serves as a stative verb. Stative verbs describe unchanging situations or conditions rather than actions or events. In this case, \\"comes from\\" alludes to a person's background or the place, situation, or circumstances from which they originate. \\"Humble origins\\" refers to modest, unprivileged, or low social and economic beginnings. So, this phrase is highlighting that the person comes from a humble background and emphasizes their roots or their upbringing. This usage of \\"come\\" does not involve any active task, request, or imperative command, like in the first example. In summary, the word \\"come\\" has different meanings in these two phrases. In \\"Come out of the closet!\\", \\"come\\" represents an imperative command for someone to reveal their hidden truths, whereas in \\"He comes from humble origins.\\", \\"come\\" denotes a reference to a person's humble background or upbringing. These different meanings depend on the specific context of the word use and showcase the versatility of the term \\"come\\" in the English language."},{"instruction":"Background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests.

I tried to shut the computer down, and it seized up altogether. Unsure of what else to do, I yanked the battery out. Unfortunately, Windows had been in the midst of a crucial undertaking. The next morning, when I turned my computer back on, it informed me that a file had been corrupted and Windows would not load. Then, it offered to repair itself by using the Windows Setup CD. I opened the special drawer where I keep CDs. But no Windows CD in there. I was forced to call the computer company's Global Support Centre.

The 19-year-old is currently playing for Spain at the World Under-20 Championships in Colombia and has signed a four-year deal with last season's Premier League runners-up. The deal is worth 7 million and includes a buy back clause, set at 14 million after the first year and 21 million after the second. Romeu started his career at Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol before joining the Camp Nou academy in 2004. The midfielder, who can also play in central defence, made his debut for Barcelona in last season's Spanish Supercup match with Seville and got his first taste of league action against Deportivo in May 2010. He has played 90 minutes in both of Spain's games at the World Under-20 Championships, when they beat Costa Rica and Ecuador. Chelsea official web site confirmed the signing and said Romeu is \\"renowned for his strength and his expansive passing ability.\\" Another player leaving Barcelona is Jeffren Suarez after he agreed to join Sporting Lisbon.

With an increasing number of youngsters spending most of their time on websites such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter, concerns about the impact these platforms have on their mental health have surfaced. Studies and research have been done to gain a better understanding of the ways in which social media influences mental health, including self-esteem, body image, anxiety, and depression. In addition, social media usage patterns and the intensified exposure to peer comparison, cyberbullying, and instant validation through likes and comments have been examined to see how they contribute to the increased mental health issues among teenagers. Hypothesis: Increased use of social media leads to higher levels of anxiety and depression in teenagers. Based on the context provided, the hypothesis we will investigate is that increased use of social media leads to higher levels of anxiety and depression in teenagers. To test this hypothesis, researchers can gather data by collecting the amount of time spent on social media platforms, as well as tracking mental health indicators such as anxiety and depression scores in teenagers who frequently use social media. Additionally, researchers can also study the type and quality of interactions that teenagers have on these platforms, allowing for a clearer understanding of the contributing factors behind the rising number of mental health issues among teenagers. To support or refute the hypothesis, researchers can conduct studies with experimental and control groups. A longitudinal study, following teenagers over a period of time, can help in understanding the long-term impact of social media usage on their mental health. Moreover, researchers can include socio-demographic factors, offline social support, and coping mechanisms such as sports or other hobbies as control variables to eliminate confounding factors. If the hypothesis is supported by the data, it would highlight the need for parents, educators, and mental health professionals to develop strategies and programs to counter the potentially harmful effects of social media on the mental health of teenagers. Such interventions may include educating children on healthy social media habits, making platforms safer by addressing instances of cyberbullying, and promoting other ways of socializing and building self-esteem. All these efforts can contribute to minimizing the risks associated with excessive social media use and help in fostering the mental well-being of teenagers."},{"instruction":"Hugo is a 2011 epic historical adventure drama film directed and co-produced by Martin Scorsese and adapted for the screen by John Logan. Based on Brian Selznick's book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, it is about a boy who lives alone in the Gare Montparnasse railway station in Paris in the 1930s. A co-production between Graham King's GK Films and Johnny Depp's Infinitum Nihil, the film stars Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace Moretz, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, Jude Law, Helen McCrory, and Christopher Lee. Hugo is Scorsese's first film shot in 3D, of which the filmmaker remarked, \\"I found 3D to be really interesting, because the actors were more upfront emotionally. The film currently holds a 94% \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes based on 206 reviews, with an average score of 8.3/10. The site's main consensus reads, \\"Hugo is an extravagant, elegant fantasy with an innocence lacking in many modern kids' movies, and one that emanates an unabashed love for the magic of cinema.\\" Metacritic gave the film an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 41 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"Hugo is unlike any other film Martin Scorsese has ever made, and yet possibly the closest to his heart: a big-budget, family epic in 3-D, and in some ways, a mirror of his own life. We feel a great artist has been given command of the tools and resources he needs to make a movie about--movies.\\" Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor gave it a \\"B+\\" grade and termed it as \\"an odd mixture: a deeply personal impersonal movie\\" and concluded that \\"Hugo is a mixed bag but one well worth rummaging through.\\" Christy Lemire said that it had an \\"abundant love of the power of film; being a hardcore cinephile (like Scorsese) might add a layer of enjoyment, but it certainly isn't a prerequisite for walking in the door\\" besides being \\"slightly repetitive and overlong\\". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune rated it three stars and described it as \\"rich and stimulating even when it wanders\\" explaining \\"every locale in Scorsese's vision of 1931 Paris looks and feels like another planet. The filmmaker embraces storybook artifice as wholeheartedly as he relays the tale's lessons in the importance of film preservation.\\" Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said that \\"visually Hugo is a marvel, but dramatically it's a clockwork lemon\\". Hugo was selected for the Royal Film Performance 2011 with a screening at the Odeon, Leicester Square, in London on 28 November 2011 in the presence of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall in support of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund. Richard Corliss of Time named it one of the Top 10 Best Movies of 2011, saying, \\"Scorsese's love poem, rendered gorgeously in 3-D, restores both the reputation of an early pioneer and the glory of movie history--the birth of a popular art form given new life through a master's application of the coolest new techniques\\". James Cameron called Hugo \\"a masterpiece\\" and that the film had the best use of 3D he had seen, surpassing even his own acclaimed films. How did they use it for 3D?","output":"Hugo is a movie made by Martin Scorsese in 2011. It's a big, exciting story about a boy named Hugo who lives alone in a train station in Paris in the 1930s. The movie is based on a book called The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. This movie is special because it's the first movie Martin Scorsese made using 3D technology. 3D movies make it seem like you're watching the story happen in real life, with things popping out of the screen towards you. It's like you're there in the world of the movie. Scorsese used 3D in Hugo to make everything look more real and magical, making the people and the places in the movie stand out. It also helped the actors show their emotions more clearly. Other filmmakers, like James Cameron who made 3D movies too, think the 3D in Hugo looked even better than in their own films.

Importance Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reflects past glucose concentrations, but this relationship may differ between those with sickle cell trait (SCT) and those without it. Objective To evaluate the association between SCT and HbA1c for given levels of fasting or 2-hour glucose levels among African Americans. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study using data collected from 7938 participants in 2 community-based cohorts, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study and the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). From the CARDIA study, 2637 patients contributed a maximum of 2 visits (2005-2011); from the JHS, 5301 participants contributed a maximum of 3 visits (2000-2013). All visits were scheduled at approximately 5-year intervals. Participants without SCT data, those without any concurrent HbA1c and glucose measurements, and those with hemoglobin variants HbSS, HbCC, or HbAC were excluded. Analysis of the primary outcome was conducted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to examine the association of SCT with HbA1c levels, controlling for fasting or 2-hour glucose measures. Exposures Presence of SCT. Main Outcomes and Measures Hemoglobin A1c stratified by the presence or absence of SCT was the primary outcome measure. Results The analytic sample included 4620 participants (mean age, 52.3 [SD, 11.8] years; 2835 women [61.3%]; 367 [7.9%] with SCT) with 9062 concurrent measures of fasting glucose and HbA1c levels. In unadjusted GEE analyses, for a given fasting glucose, HbA1c values were statistically significantly lower in those with (5.72%) vs those without (6.01%) SCT (mean HbA1c difference, −0.29%; 95% CI, −0.35% to −0.23%). Findings were similar in models adjusted for key risk factors and in analyses using 2001 concurrent measures of 2-hour glucose and HbA1c concentration for those with SCT (mean, 5.35%) vs those without SCT (mean, 5.65%) for a mean HbA1c difference of −0.30% (95% CI, −0.39% to −0.21%). The HbA1c difference by SCT was greater at higher fasting (P = .02 for interaction) and 2-hour (P = .03) glucose concentrations. The prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes was statistically significantly lower among participants with SCT when defined using HbA1c values (29.2% vs 48.6% for prediabetes and 3.8% vs 7.3% for diabetes in 572 observations from participants with SCT and 6877 observations from participants without SCT; P<.001 for both comparisons). Conclusions and Relevance Among African Americans from 2 large, well-established cohorts, participants with SCT had lower levels of HbA1c at any given concentration of fasting or 2-hour glucose compared with participants without SCT. These findings suggest that HbA1c may systematically underestimate past glycemia in black patients with SCT and may require further evaluation.

It is made up of 29 coral atolls and offers an abundance of sea life as well as shipwrecks and articles from the World War II era. Its capital, Majuro, hosting the large lagoon, is a hub for business and international affairs. A pertinent question about the Marshall Islands could be: What is the history, culture, economy, and environmental challenges facing the Marshall Islands? With a unique location at the crossroads of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands have a history that dates back thousands of years. The islands were originally settled by migrants from Southeast Asia around 2,000 BC, and the culture they established has influenced the region ever since. The islands were later colonized by a succession of Western powers, including Spain, Germany, Japan, and finally, the United States after World War II. Historically, the islands were known for their matrilineal customs, with land rights and resources being passed down through the mother’s line. These customs still retain a significant presence in Marshallese society. While they engage in Western-style political practices, the Marshallese have managed to blend these practices with their traditional systems of governance. Religion, predominantly Christianity, also plays a role in their cultural practices, contributing to their rich storytelling tradition. The economy of the islands relies heavily on U.S aid, as per the terms of the Compact of Free Association (COFA), under which, the US has military strategic interests in the islands. Despite this, there are opportunities in agriculture, fisheries, and increasingly in tourism, since the Islands offer unique scuba diving experiences. However, with an average elevation of only two meters above sea level, the Marshall Islands face severe environmental challenges. The threat of climate change and resultant sea-level rise are a significant concern. There are also issues related to the lasting impacts of nuclear testing conducted by the U.S. during the 1940s and 1950s, leading to ongoing health issues and environmental damage. In summary, the inquiry into the Marshall Islands' history, culture, economy, and environmental challenges reveal a country at the confluence of traditional and modern practices, striving to maintain its identity while maneuvering through the complexities of geopolitics and grappling with the challenges of climate change and environmental degradation."},{"instruction":"What is the best way to: how do you get picked for jury duty?","output":"Well, little buddy, jury duty is when grown-ups help decide if someone has followed the rules or not in a courtroom.

William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

It involves a beautiful young victim and a cunning psychopathic killer. It's a real-life mystery that's inspired countless moviemakers and writers from \\"Double Indemnity,\\" \\"Chinatown\\" and \\"L.A. Confidential.\\" Even the nickname, \\"Black Dahlia,\\" is straight out of the movies. The Blue Dahlia was a nightclub in a 1946 crime film. Newspapers adapted the title to fit the Short murder case - and the \\"Black Dahlia\\" legend was born. The mystery behind the legend continues to inspire great storytellers. This fall, director Brian De Palma, and a cast that includes Hilary Swank, Scarlett Johansson and Josh Hartnett, once again brings the twisted case of The Black Dahlia to the big screen. \\"The question always - how does something like that, how does that beautiful girl, we see pin-up shots of, become this and who that too her and why. It's one of those mysteries that will go on forever,\\" says De Palma. \\"It's the great L.A. murder,\\" says Ellroy. \\"And L.A. has had some doozies.\\" Correspondent Erin Moriarty reports on a story about love and loneliness, murder and madness, all played out in Los Angeles. Steve Hodel was just five years old when Elizabeth Short was murdered. As a cop, he worked the same Hollywood streets Short once knew. \\"I had lots of murders where you had young runaways, and within weeks they'd have a needle in their arm and they'd be doing tricks on Hollywood Blvd.,\\" says Steve, who investigated 300 murders over more than 17 years. To Hodel, the Black Dahlia case was just another cold case. But after he retired, the case would come back to haunt him. \\"The upper torso was juxtaposed just off to the left, about 12 inches,\\" he says. \\"The killer was sure that it would be found fairly quickly, as it was. Clearly, he wasn't trying to hide it. He wanted the notoriety.\\" And the killer got what he wanted. For weeks, a terrified city watched as the search for the Black Dahlia killer unfolded. There were dozens of false confessions, and hundreds of other suspects questioned and cleared. The killer even wrote letters taunting the police and sent Short's personal address book to a local newspaper. After the biggest manhunt in L.A. history, the murder was officially listed as unsolved. And it's stayed that way for nearly 60 years. Short was a vibrant young woman from the working-class neighborhood of Medford, Mass., outside Boston. She was growing up in a dark time, during the height of the Depression. Post-war Los Angeles was a boomtown, overrun with ex-servicemen, star-struck wannabes and hustlers. It was a place where pretty faces were a dime a dozen and life could be tough. Short became a Hollywood hanger-on, going out on the town each night, usually with a different guy. Her last night alive was Jan. 14, 1947. \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" was playing at Hollywood's Pantages Theater. Around dawn the next day, a mysterious black car was seen in the spot where Short's body was later found. It was a black car very similar to the 1936 Packard owned by Steve Hodel's father, Dr. George Hodel. George Hodel was a brilliant man, with an IQ of 186, and a child musical prodigy. After a stint as a newspaper reporter at 16, he sailed through medical school, studying surgery. He settled in Los Angeles, running the county's venereal disease clinic, where it was rumored that he treated some of L.A.'s top brass. ||||| Human remains found in the foothills above Hollywood may be linked to the decades-old killing of an actress. Patrick Healy reports for the NBC4 News at 6 on Saturday, May 31, 2014. (Published Saturday, May 31, 2014) Remains May Be Linked to Decades-Old Killing of Actress, Retired Detective Says First a cadaver dog, now chemical analysis support the suspicions of a retired police detective that human remains were buried in the foothills above Hollywood decades ago, NBC4 has learned. Analysis of soil taken from a location indicated by the cadaver dog found chemical markers for human decomposition, said the scientist who performed the labwork at the request of the retired detective. It's the theory of former detective that as many as 10 long-unsolved slayings of young women in Los Angeles in the 1940's were committed by a single serial killer. What adds poignance to Hodel's suspicion is his personal connection to the suspect he's identified: the late medical doctor George Hodel -- the retired detective's father. \\"I see him as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\\" said Hodel, alluding to the fictional split personality depicted in one of Hollywood's first horror films. \\"Unfortunately, the monster, Mr. Hyde, was stronger and over-ruled the good.\\" Hodel's suspicions date back more than a decade. After his father's death, going through possessions, Hodel came across evidence that implicated his father in the infamous 1947 dismemberment murder of a young woman named Elizabeth Short, remembered to this day as the Black Dahlia. Writing books and continuing his research, Hodel came to suspect his father had killed repeatedly before fleeing to Asia in the late 1940s. During that decade, the Hodels lived in what is now regarded as a Hollywood landmark, the Sowden House designed by the famed architect Lloyd Wright in the distinctive Mayan block style that was developed by his even more famous father Frank Lloyd Wright. Records long stored in the District Attorney's office confirm that the doctor had come under suspicion in the Dahlia case, and that police had planted a listening bug in the house. Transcripts reveal that detectives heard him discussing the Dahlia at one point. At another time, they heard from the basement what sounded like a woman being attacked. Hodel believes his father committed murders in or near the house, and in some cases buried the remains nearby in unmarked graves. In 2012, Hodel was able to return to the Sowden house when he was invited to participate in a TV program being recorded there. Hodel got permission to bring along another retired cop, former Mammoth Lakes Police Sgt. Paul Dostie, who has worked extensively with Buster, his search dog. Buster indicated a scent of human decomposition at several locations, including in the alley behind the house. But where the scent is picked up does not necessarily mean that is where the chemical remains are located; carried over time by water or gravity, the marker molecules can migrate considerable distances, according to forensic anthropologist Arpad Vass, PhD, a pioneer in chemical analysis of human decomposition. A soil sample was taken from the alley, and late last year Vass used gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify the chemicals in it. \\"The soil came up positive for human remains because there are a number of human specific markers,\\" said Vass from his laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. What is more difficult is narrowing down how long ago death occurred. Vass's estimate: 20-100 years ago. The chemical analysis cannot help determined cause of death, or even whether or not it was homicide, Vass noted. But he said his findings are \\"consistent\\" with Steve Hodel's theory of homicide victims buried in shallow graves 70-80 years ago. \\"We're talking about clearing potentially 10 cases,\\" Hodel said. But who? Definitely not Elizabeth Short, Hodel is quick to say, pointing out that all of her remains were accounted for. But the possibilities include actress Jean Spangler, then 26, her career on the rise in 1949 when she vanished. Nothing more than her purse was found days later in Griffith Park, not far from the Hodel home. A note inside hinted she was going to have an abortion, then illegal. Dr. Hodel was one of the few physicians who then performed abortions in Los Angeles, Steve Hodel found in his research. He also discovered Spangler and his father had a mutual friend. Hodel hopes to search further for the human remains, but has been unable to get permission to go onto the privately owned hillside. After repeated attempts by Hodel the past decade to interest LAPD in following up on his civilian investigation, LAPD passed again. \\"Too old, too cold.\\" was the feedback Hodel said he got. But if it appears the ageless sleuth is running out of leads to pursue--don't count on it. His research has led to three books, Black Dahlia Avenger, Black Dahlia Avenger II, and Most Evil, in which Steve Hodel lays out his case that when his father traveled to northern California in the 1960s he committed the infamous Zodiac murders. Steve Hodel still hopes to find the source of the scent of human decomposition near his childhood Hollywood home. \\"I'm going to keep digging,\\" Hodel vowed--figuratively, if not literally. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The unsolved murder case of Elizabeth Short, known as the Black Dahlia, has haunted Los Angeles for nearly 60 years. Retired police detective Steve Hodel has become convinced that his father, Dr. George Hodel, was the killer behind not only the Black Dahlia murder but also several others in L.A. during the 1940s. After discovering human decomposition chemicals in soil taken from the area near the family home, Hodel continues to search for more evidence to prove his theory, despite the LAPD considering the case to be \\"too old, too cold.\\""},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The first sentence states that the People's Army for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) and Angolan troops took the city on February 1, 1976, during the Cuban civil war. This sentence implies that FAPLA and the Angolan troops participated in the Cuban civil war and captured the city during this conflict. Thus, there could be confusion about the event's location, as it might be understood as occurring in Cuba. 2. The second sentence says that the popular armed forces for the liberation of Angola (FAPLA) and Cuban troops took the city on February 1, 1976, during the Angolan civil war. This sentence is clearer about the event's location and the conflict it was a part of. Here, it is clear that the event took place in Angola and that the Angolan civil war was happening. The involvement of Cuban troops suggests a collaboration or alliance between FAPLA and Cuban forces. To summarize, while both sentences share the information about FAPLA and Cuban troops capturing a city on February 1, 1976, there is a distinction in the conflicts mentioned.

To provide a detailed answer regarding this conclusion, we must break down the process of how to select a pug and give an explanation on whether or not this conclusion can be drawn from the initial statement. The initial statement suggests using breed standards, particularly from the American Kennel Club (AKC), to assess pug puppies during the selection process. These standards can help verify that the puppy is a purebred, giving prospective owners more confidence in their choice. However, the initial statement does not mention anything about the ownership of a puppy or any references to \\"fetch.\\" Let's analyze the information given in the initial statement and see if it connects to the conclusion: 1. It is important to use breed standards to assess a pug: Using these standards, potential owners can determine whether the puppy is a purebred pug or not. This criterion is essential for those looking for a pug with breed-specific traits and characteristics. 2. The American Kennel Club provides breed standards that can be helpful: The AKC is a reputable organization that sets the breed standards for various types of dogs, including pugs. Prospective pug owners can refer to these established standards to guide them in choosing a pug. 3. Some aspects of the breed standard may not apply to puppies: When assessing a pug puppy, not all the AKC breed standards may be suitable due to the age and development stage of the puppy. Therefore, potential owners should focus on those standards that are applicable to puppies while considering the puppy's health and temperament. Now, let's consider the conclusion given: \\"a puppy is owned by fetch.\\" The word 'fetch' could either refer to an action (i.e., the act of retrieving an item), or it could be the name of a person or an entity. In either case, the conclusion does not have any direct connection with the initial statement. The process of using breed standards to select a pug does not provide any information on the ownership of the puppy or any association with \\"fetch.\\" In summary, the conclusion that \\"a puppy is owned by fetch\\" cannot be drawn from the initial statement about using breed standards to select a pug.

Gather ingredients and supplies - You will need fresh peppers, vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and any additional spices or herbs for flavor. You will also need a pot, jars with lids for canning, a canning tool or tongs, and a clean workspace. Step justification: Preparing the necessary ingredients and supplies beforehand ensures a smooth pickling process and minimizes the risk of spoilage or contamination. 2. Clean and prepare the peppers - Rinse the peppers under cold water to remove any dirt, and then cut off the stem ends. Depending on the size and type of the peppers, you can either leave them whole or slice them into rings or desired shapes. Step justification: Cleaning and cutting the peppers helps to preserve their freshness and ensures even pickling. 3. Prepare the pickling brine - In a pot, combine vinegar, water, sugar, and salt. Bring it to a boil, stirring occasionally until sugar and salt are dissolved. Add any additional spices and herbs for flavor. Step justification: The pickling brine is what preserves the peppers and gives them their characteristic tangy taste. Boiling the brine ensures a homogeneous mixture and proper dissolution of the sugar and salt. 4. Fill the jars - While the brine is boiling, place the prepared peppers into clean, sterilized jars. Once the brine is ready, carefully pour it over the peppers in the jars, leaving about 1/2 inch headspace to allow for expansion. Step justification: Carefully filling the jars with peppers and brine ensures proper preservation and prevents overpacking, which can cause breakage of the peppers or the jars during the canning process. 5. Seal the jars - Wipe the rim of each jar with a clean cloth, place a sterilized lid onto each jar, and screw on the rings until finger tight. Step justification: Properly sealing the jars helps prevent microbial contamination and provides an optimal environment for pickling. 6. Process the jars - Place the sealed jars in a water bath canner or large pot with a rack, making sure each jar is covered by at least an inch of water. Bring the water to a boil, and let the jars process (boil) for about 10 minutes. Step justification: This step is crucial for ensuring a proper seal and long-term preservation. Processing the jars in a boiling water bath kills any remaining microorganisms and creates a vacuum seal necessary for safe and effective pickling. 7. Cool and store - After processing, carefully remove the jars using canning tongs and let them cool on a towel or cooling rack for at least 12 hours. Check the seals by pressing the lid-center; if it doesn't move, the jar is sealed. Store the pickled peppers in a cool, dark place for at least 2-4 weeks to allow the flavors to develop. Refrigerate the jars after opening. Step justification: Proper cooling, checking seals, and storing the jars ensures long-term preservation of the pickled peppers and allows the flavors to meld and develop over time. In summary, the entire process of creating pickled peppers, including preparing the ingredients, canning, and allowing for the flavors to develop, takes roughly 2-4 weeks."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you will be given a set of steps that are required to answer a specific question.

At Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This...

He turns his nose up at just about anything. Although he did just spend a week with his grandparents and decided he would eat and make up for lost meals…and make me out to be a liar! Anyway, I keep reminding myself as I find myself challenged at mealtimes, that soon enough, they’ll be eating us out of house and home. So, one of the larger dream kitchen appliances I’d like in our home would be a double oven! I just think it’d come in really handy when trying to keep up with their metabolism down the road! When you’re preparing a lot of food, you’re typically buying a lot of products, and the garbage and recycling bins fill up faster than ever as well. The second dream kitchen appliance I wouldn’t mind having would be the KitchenAid Trash Compactor, reducing our use of garbage bags and trips to the outside dumpster. Plus, I think I’d like not having to smell the garbage all the time! Question: The author wrote this Essay === The answer to the above question is Pick from: A).

Here's a detailed breakdown of what Jordan should have done: 1. Reflect on his actions: Jordan should have taken a moment to analyze his actions that led to the teacher's emotional response. This self-reflection would help him to understand whether his behavior was intentional or unintentional. 2. Empathize with the teacher: After recognizing his actions, Jordan should have put himself in the teacher's shoes and tried to understand the pain and distress he might have caused her. Empathy is crucial in acknowledging one's actions and their impact on others. 3. Apologize to the teacher: Upon realizing the hurtful nature of his actions, Jordan should have taken responsibility for them and sincerely apologized to the teacher. An honest apology has the potential to mend strained relationships and demonstrate maturity and accountability. 4. Listen to the teacher's perspective: After apologizing, Jordan should have given the teacher an opportunity to express her feelings and thoughts on the situation. Engaging in active listening would show respect for her opinion and allow both parties to better understand each other's perspectives. 5. Discuss and learn from the incident: In order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, Jordan should have discussed the incident openly, listened to the teacher's suggestions, and demonstrated his willingness to learn from the situation. 6. Seek guidance from a counselor or school authority: If the issue was still unresolved or had escalated further, Jordan would have been wise to consult with a school counselor, principal, or other appropriate authority figure. This would help facilitate a conversation around the incident and potentially offer guidance or mediation between Jordan and the teacher. 7. Identify ways to make amends: Jordan should have considered possible ways to make amends for his actions, such as writing a heartfelt letter, offering to help the teacher with her tasks, or performing acts of kindness for her and others in the school community. Such actions can show genuine remorse and a willingness to take positive steps toward personal growth. In conclusion, Jordan should have taken the necessary steps to right his wrongs and make amends with the teacher before leaving the room. This would not only demonstrate maturity and responsibility but also help build a healthy, respectful relationship between him and the teacher, which would ultimately contribute to a more positive learning environment."},{"instruction":"Ahern, who was travelling to Tokyo for an EU-Japan summit yesterday, will consult with other EU leaders by telephone later this week in an effort to find an agreed candidate to presidency of the European commission.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Available choices: (A). yes. (B). it is not possible to tell. (C). no. And the answer is:","output":"(C). no. The hypothesis, \\"It's too bad you've never been fishing,\\" is not entailed by the premise, which is asking about the type of bait used for crappie and bass. The premise simply conveys a desire to know the appropriate choice of bait for these two fish species, and does not necessarily suggest that the individual has no prior experience with fishing. Now, to answer the question about bait for crappie and bass, let's dive into the details. Fishing for crappie and bass requires knowledge of their behavior and preferred habitats, as well as understanding the most effective bait types for each species. Although different baits may be used successfully for both fish, there are some baits that tend to perform better for each species. For crappie: Crappie are generally more active and found in larger numbers near underwater structures, such as submerged trees, vegetation, and even sunken artificial habitats. They primarily feed on smaller fish, insects, and crustaceans. Here are some popular bait options for crappie fishing: 1. Live Minnows: Live minnows are one of the most popular and effective baits for crappie, as they are an essential part of their natural diet. Rigging a live minnow beneath a slip bobber or using a jighead can yield excellent results. 2. Jigs: Small jigs in various colors and styles can also be highly effective for crappie. Colors like chartreuse, black, and white tend to work well, but it's essential to experiment with different color patterns and jigging motions to find the most successful combination. 3. Insect imitations: Crappie may also be enticed by artificial lures that imitate insects and small aquatic invertebrates. Soft plastic lures like tube baits, grubs, and shad tails often prove fruitful, as do small spinners and beetle spins. For bass: Bass are aggressive predators that are attracted to a wide variety of bait, depending on their mood and environmental conditions. Commonly found in areas with cover and structure, they prey on smaller fish, crawfish, and insects. Some popular bait choices for bass fishing include: 1. Soft Plastic Lures: Soft plastic lures like worms, craws, and creature baits are among the most versatile and effective baits for bass fishing. Texas-rigged soft plastics work great in heavy cover, while a Carolina-rigged worm can be the go-to setup in open water environments. 2. Crankbaits: Crankbaits mimic the movement and vibration of small fish in the water, attracting bass and provoking strikes. They come in various diving depths and colors, which should be chosen based on the current fishing environment and conditions. 3. Spinnerbaits and chatterbaits: These baits combine an attractive flash from a spinning blade with the added enticement of a soft plastic trailer that wiggles and swims like an injured prey. They work exceptionally well in areas with dense vegetation and underwater structures, where other lures might become snagged. 4. Topwater lures: Topwater lures like poppers, frogs, and walkers create commotion on the water's surface and can incite violent, explosive strikes from bass, especially during early morning and late evening hours. In conclusion, the best bait for crappie and bass will largely depend on the specific environment, the time of day, and the prevalent prey species in the area. Good angling practices dictate that you experiment with different bait options to determine which combination works best in each situation."},{"instruction":"Police barricaded Istanbul's main Taksim Square and used water cannons to disperse crowds on Saturday to prevent demonstrators from entering Gezi Park, the site of protests for more than a month. Interior Minister Muammer Guler said the government won't permit \\"illegal\\" demonstrations in the park. \\"We will not and cannot permit demonstration or marches in those places,\\" the minister said. \\"Without it being a demonstration or a protest march, they can use Gezi Park as they please.

The 6th Administrative Court in Istanbul overruled some parts of the Taksim development project, including plans to rebuild old barracks in Gezi Park. Taksim Solidarity, an umbrella platform of activists and civil society groups, put out a call after ruling for people to gather in Gezi Park, which has not been open to the public since June 16. European Union, Turkey avoid rupture in relations. \\"We are going to our park to deliver the court decision by hand, which cancels the project aimed to disidentify, depopulate and concretize Gezi Park, to the ones who shut the park down to the people,\\" said Taksim Solidarity in a written statement. \\"We are going to our park to open its doors to its real owners, so to everyone again.\\" \\"They are in the smaller streets trying to prevent people from even reaching Istiklal,\\" said Irem Koker, an eyewitness.

One of the men with a machete is seen in the video beating a woman once with the blade and then kicking her in the small of the back. The amateur video also showed several police officers physically trying to separate the two men from the people they were attacking. An eyewitness told CNN he and several other anti-government protesters took shelter in a building in Talimhane when they saw the men shown in the video attacking demonstrators. \\"There were two guys in the middle of the street. We saw them from afar. They have these things that looked like swords, not knives but like rounded swords.

To give the message 'we're out here.' It wasn't like they were hiding the swords.\\" Mutlu said the suspected attackers had been detained by police. \\"The two people with swords and sticks that were part of the events that took place after the illegal protest in Taksim have been detained and are being processed,\\" Mutlu wrote on his official Twitter account. \\"Our security officer was wounded while trying to apprehend the attacker armed with a sword who was seen in videos,\\" Mutlu said.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - The New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston region.

Situated in Berlin during the Weimar Republic in 1931, under the presence of the growing Nazi Party, the film is loosely based on the 1966 Broadway musical Cabaret by Kander and Ebb, which was adapted from the novel The Berlin Stories / Goodbye to Berlin (1939) by Christopher Isherwood and the 1951 play I Am a Camera adapted from the same book. Only a few numbers from the stage score were used for the film; Kander and Ebb wrote new ones to replace those that were discarded. In the traditional manner of musical theater, called an \\"integrated musical\\", every significant character in the stage version sings to express his or her own emotion and to advance the plot. Roger Ebert gave a positive review, saying: \\"This is no ordinary musical. Part of its success comes because it doesn't fall for the old cliche that musicals have to make you happy. Instead of cheapening the movie version by lightening its load of despair, director Bob Fosse has gone right to the bleak heart of the material and stayed there well enough to win an Academy Award for Best Director.\\" Variety says: \\"The film version of the 1966 John Kander-Fred Ebb Broadway musical Cabaret is most unusual: it is literate, bawdy, sophisticated, sensual, cynical, heart-warming, and disturbingly thought-provoking. Liza Minnelli heads a strong cast. Bob Fosse's generally excellent direction recreates the milieu of Germany some 40 years ago.\\" Jamie Russel from BBC.com reviewed: \\"The first musical ever to be given an X certificate, Bob Fosse's 'Cabaret' launched Liza Minnelli into Hollywood superstardom and reinvented the musical for the Age of Aquarius.\\" Pauline Kael wrote a review applauding the film: \\"A great movie musical. Taking its form from political cabaret, it's a satire of temptations. In a prodigious balancing act, Bob Fosse, the choreographer-director, keeps the period--Berlin, 1931--at a cool distance. We see the decadence as garish and sleazy; yet we also see the animal energy in it--everything seems to become sexualized. The movie does not exploit decadence; rather, it gives it its due. With Joel Grey as our devil-doll host--the master of ceremonies--and Liza Minnelli (in her first singing role on the screen) as exuberant, corruptible Sally Bowles, chasing after the life of a headliner no matter what; Minnelli has such gaiety and electricity that she becomes a star before our eyes.\\" In 2013, film critic Peter Bradshaw listed Cabaret at number one on his list of \\"Top 10 musicals\\", describing it as \\"satanically catchy, terrifyingly seductive ... directed and choreographed with electric style by Bob Fosse ...

He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Such a gap to their Catalan cousins has heaped the pressure on Real coach Jose Mourinho, who must now focus on Spain's premier cup competition, the Copa del Rey, and the European Champions League for salvation. All might be forgiven if he was to secure Europe's most prestigious club prize for a third time as coach, after previous triumphs with Portuguese side Porto and Italian giants Inter Milan. At the very least Real's fans will expect him to win the Spain's second biggest domestic trophy, and a 2-0 win in the first leg of their Copa del Rey tie was enough to quieten the protests against him. A strike from Karim Benzema and an AndrÃ©s Guardado own goal sealed victory on a chilly night in Madrid but Real rode their luck on several occasions in front of their vociferous home support. Cristiano Ronaldo, as ever, was at the center of most of Real's attacking thrusts in the early stages, the Portuguese striker firing a free kick narrowly wide of the post in the opening stages. Luka Modric, signed last year from English club Tottenham Hotspur, then spurned a glorious chance to put Real ahead before Valencia's Brazilian striker Jonas twice went close in a matter of minutes. His misses were to prove costly as Benzema then slotted home from Germany international Sami Khedira's pass inside the area on 37 minutes. Real's fans began to get restless around the hour mark as Valencia began to dominate before Jonas shot wide of an open goal from 12 yards after Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas had parried Roberto Soldado's effort into his path. Again, within minutes of a Jonas miss Real scored, this time Valencia defender Guardado putting through his own net from a Fabio Coentrao cross. Ronaldo was then denied his 29th goal of the season by two brilliant saves from Valencia goalkeeper Vicente, who first repelled the striker's point blank shot from ten yards out before flicking a powerful strike round the post less than a minute later. A 2-0 win gives Real a comfortable cushion going into the return leg in Valencia next Wednesday. In the Italian Cup, Inter Milan had to rely on a goal seconds from the end of extra time to beat Bologna 3-2 and progress to the semifinals. Goals from Fredy Guarin and Rodrigo Palacio put Inter in a commanding position but two goals in four minutes from Alessandro Diamanti and Manolo Gabbiadini pushed the match into extra time. But with a penalty shootout looming Andrea Ranocchia's header crushed Bologna and sent Inter through to the next round. In England's premier cup competition, the FA Cup, there were replay wins for Premier League sides Wigan, Queens Park Rangers, Stoke and Fulham, though Sunderland succumbed to second tier Bolton.","output":"Defending champions Real Madrid currently lag behind their arch-rivals, Barcelona, by a massive 18 points in the Spanish League.

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.

Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States.

Does it follow that \\"it has not been a significant source of growth at all.\\"?","output":"The statement that \\"it has not been a significant source of growth at all\\" does not necessarily follow from the given information. To fully assess the claim, we need to examine the context surrounding the subject in question, what \\"it\\" refers to, and the relative importance of its contributions to the overall growth. Based on the information presented, \\"it\\" seems to have played a considerable role in promoting the growth of the subject at hand. The phrase \\"a substantial cause of the tremendous growth\\" implies that the factor in question has had a major impact since its inception, contributing significantly to the scale and momentum of expansion. However, when evaluating the importance of this factor, it is essential to consider other influences that could have also contributed to the growth. There may be multiple factors at play, with \\"it\\" being just one among them. It is possible that other sources or forces have played a larger role or have cooperated with \\"it\\" in driving the growth process. To accurately gauge the significance of \\"it\\" in the overall growth, we can examine several factors: 1. The proportion of growth attributable to \\"it\\": By studying the cause-and-effect relationship between \\"it\\" and the growth seen since its introduction, we can determine the degree to which \\"it\\" has driven expansion. A strong positive correlation might suggest \\"it\\" has been a critical driver of growth. 2. The role of external factors: Assessing other potential factors that may have contributed to the growth will help paint a more complete picture of the situation. By comparing how the impact of \\"it\\" measures up against other contributors, one can determine whether the statement holds true. 3. Timeframe: The timeframe of the observation is essential to note. Considering whether \\"it\\" has maintained its significance in promoting growth from its inception until now, or if its impact waxes and wanes over time, will provide more context for the claim. 4. Measures of growth: Evaluating the metrics used to measure growth - be it revenue, users, market share, or any other indicator - can give insight into the importance of \\"it\\" in the overall expansion process. Understanding the context and benchmarks used to assess growth will help in determining the role of \\"it\\" in the process. In conclusion, the statement that \\"it has not been a significant source of growth at all\\" cannot be fully validated without examining the specific subject or context where \\"it\\" has contributed to growth. It is crucial to analyze the relevant factors, the role of other possible contributors, and the measures of growth to determine the true significance of \\"it\\" in driving expansion. From the information provided, it appears that \\"it\\" has indeed contributed to the substantial growth.

After that, I won’t be posting here, or reading what you post. I will be deleting the apps from my devices. I’ve already quit Facebook-owned Instagram and erased its app. I am doing this - after being on Facebook for nearly 12 years - because my own values and the policies and actions of Facebook have diverged to the point where I’m no longer comfortable here. I know that, by leaving Facebook, and its other services, like Instagram and Messenger, I will be missing updates on the lives of friends who post only on these platforms. I regret that very much. However, I am not going into hiding and would be delighted to remain in touch with friends and acquaintances through other channels. I will remain on Twitter at @waltmossberg, and, if you follow me on Twitter, you can direct-message me there. Those of you who are friends and have my phone number can also still reach me by iMessage, plain text message, or voice. Feel free also to email me at wmossberg@verizon.net or another email if you have it. (Again, I won’t be on Facebook Messenger.) I am hardly the first person to quit Facebook and I am not urging anyone else to do so, or trying to spark some dump-Facebook movement. Nor am I judging anyone who remains, or everyone who works there. I know some Facebook employees, and I like and admire them, personally. This is a decision I am making just for myself. If the company or the service change significantly for the better, in my view, or become effectively regulated, I may resume regular use. But I have no current plans to do that as of now. So, I just wanted you to know I’ll be gone from Facebook soon. Walt ||||| Facebook will be losing yet another prominent user: Walt Mossberg, one of the most respected technology journalists of our era, said that he will delete his account at the end of this year. The former Wall Street Journal, Verge, and Recode writer announced on Facebook his Facebook and Messenger accounts will be deactivated \\"around the end of the year\\" (or in other words, any day now) and he will no longer be posting content on the social network. SEE ALSO: How to Delete Something Permanently From Your Computer \\"I am doing this — after being on Facebook for nearly 12 years — because my own values and the policies and actions of Facebook have diverged to the point where I’m no longer comfortable here,\\" Mossberg said in a Facebook post. Mossberg, who currently has 266,185 followers on Facebook, said he's already quit and deleted the Instagram app, which owned by Facebook. He said leaving Facebook and Messenger is simply finishing his abandonment of the company and its platforms. Mossberg stressed his quitting is not to \\"spark some dump-Facebook movement\\" nor is it an attack on any Facebook employees and their work. Instead, it was a personal decision based on his values. Though he left open the possibility of returning to Facebook in the future if it becomes \\"effectively regulated,\\" he has \\"no current plans to do that as of now.\\" In place of Facebook and its platforms, he says he'll remain active on Twitter and various other platforms such as iMessage, email, and text message. Despite Mossberg explicitly saying he is not calling for everyone to follow his lead and quit Facebook, his disappearance from the platform will be felt, and his followers might reconsider their own values and whether Facebook fits or not. Make no mistake, losing prominent users such as Mossberg leaves a lasting impact on Facebook, which has been losing the hearts and minds of some of its most dedicated users in the wake of scandal after scandal. As a major pioneer of consumer electronics reporting and reviews, Mossberg's decision will send a ripple (however small or large) throughout the technology sphere. He's all-but-directly saying Facebook is a scourge. Every social network has its own problems, but deciding to cut one of them out (especially when you've used it as publishing platform) is a bold step towards reducing its power and reach. Another one bites the dust. Who's next? ||||| Walt Mossberg is far from alone in giving up on Facebook. But as a leading technology journalist who has spent decades chronicling the impact of Silicon Valley’s policies, his exit from the social network speaks louder than most. Mr. Mossberg, a veteran of The Wall Street Journal, The Verge and Recode, said on Monday he would be deactivating his Facebook account, along with the Facebook-owned Messenger and Instagram apps. “I am doing this — after being on Facebook for nearly 12 years — because my own values and the policies and actions of Facebook have diverged to the point where I’m no longer comfortable here,” he wrote on Facebook. While Mr. Mossberg didn’t list any specific complaints on Monday, his history of public writing left little doubt that his ire was aimed largely at the company’s policies and actions on user privacy. He declined to comment when reached by email. ||||| Summary:","output":"Veteran technology journalist Walt Mossberg has announced his decision to deactivate his Facebook account and Facebook Messenger, as well as leaving Instagram, by the end of the year. Mossberg cited the divergence between his personal values and the policies and actions of Facebook as the reason for his departure. He emphasized that his decision was personal, not meant to spark a movement or criticize individual Facebook employees. Mossberg will continue to use Twitter and other platforms to communicate and share content."},{"instruction":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards was Folk's longest field goal?","output":"Title: Unraveling the Feat: An In-depth Look at Nick Folk's Longest Field Goal Introduction Understanding an athlete's potential requires evaluating their performance and achievements.

The shoppers saw that there was a nice luster on the table but not the chair because the","output":"The shoppers saw that there was a nice luster on the table but not the chair because the table had been meticulously cleaned, polished, and maintained, while the chair had not received the same level of attention and care. When the shoppers entered the store, their eyes were immediately drawn to the area where the furniture was displayed. Among the various items, they noticed a table and a chair that seemed to be part of the same set. As they approached the table, they could clearly see that it had been recently cleaned, as evidenced by the absence of dust, dirt, or fingerprints on its surface. Moreover, it appeared that a high-quality polish had been applied to the table, which further enhanced its natural luster and made it even more appealing to potential buyers. In contrast, the chair exhibited signs of neglect and a lack of proper cleaning. The first clue was the presence of a thin layer of dust that covered its surface, which suggested that it hadn't been wiped or dusted for quite some time. Additionally, there were a few smudges and stains on the chair that marred its appearance and detracted from its overall aesthetic appeal. It was obvious that the chair had not been polished or treated with any cleaning solution that could have helped to restore its shine and luster. The difference in cleaning standards applied to the table and the chair might have stemmed from various factors. Perhaps the store personnel were more diligent in their cleaning routines for certain items, prioritizing those that they believed would attract the most attention and generate the most interest from potential customers. Alternatively, it's possible that some confusion or miscommunication had occurred within the store's staff, leading to the oversight in the cleaning of the chair. Whatever the reason might have been, the contrast between the table and the chair served as a vivid reminder to the shoppers of the importance of proper cleaning and maintenance in preserving the beauty and functionality of furniture. In the end, the table's attractive, clean appearance and the glowing luster that it radiated made a strong positive impression on the shoppers, while the neglected state of the chair raised questions about its quality and durability. Consequently, the shoppers were inclined to consider purchasing the well-maintained table but hesitated to invest in the chair, which had not been cleaned and polished to the same high standard."},{"instruction":"What most naturally follows? . a man wearing a black shirt and blue jeans","output":"After receiving a brief description of a man wearing a black shirt and blue jeans, the most natural follow-up step would be to either receive or provide more information about the man or the situation he is in.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.

He discovers that his future brother-in-law, the vicious, homicidal Tony (Nicholas Brown), is about to marry a Mexican woman named Natasha (BÃ¡rbara Mori), whom Jai knows as Linda, the last of the immigrant women he married. On the night before \\"Natasha\\" and Tony's wedding, Linda and Jai spend a romantic but chaste night, humorously agreeing to a \\"divorce\\". A jealous, gun-wielding Tony arrives at her apartment while Jai is there. After he hits her, Linda impulsively knocks him out with a heavy object while he tussles with Jai. Linda and Jai go on the run toward Mexico, with Tony and police in pursuit. They are helped by a friend of Jai, Robin (Anand Tiwari). Robin gives them fake passports and IDs so that they can go wherever they want. In the following week, Jai and Linda get married in Mexico. On the day of their wedding, they come back to their house. There, Robin comes to give them the passports and is unexpectedly shot by Tony and his men. Linda and Jai escape, but Jai is shot in the process. In a car chase, Linda stops the car at a train, puts Jai aboard it, and drives off. Back to the present, Jai meets with Jamaal, one of Bob's employees, and is ambushed. Jamaal is killed but not before telling Jai of Linda's whereabouts. Jai kills off all of Tony's men and then kills Tony by smashing his face into the car door. He is shot then by Gina. He drives off to the location where Jamaal said Linda was last seen. It is shown that after Jai was put aboard the train, Linda was ambushed on a cliff and sent Jai a text message saying \\"I am going...Sorry, Forget me\\". She drives off of the cliff, killing herself by drowning. Jai cries and then smiles, jumping off the cliff as well. Finally,... My question: Who is a dance teacher in Las Vegas, Nevada. The answer to this question is:","output":"Jai, played by Hrithik Roshan, is a dance teacher in Las Vegas, Nevada."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What formation was the youngest of the Supai Group? ? An unconformity of 15 to 20 million years separates the Supai Group from the previously deposited Redwall Formation. Supai Group was deposited in late Mississippian, through the Pennsylvanian and into the early Permian time, some 320 million to 270 million years ago. Both marine and non-marine deposits of mud, silt, sand and calcareous sediments were laid down on a broad coastal plain similar to the Texas Gulf Coast of today. Around this time, the Ancestral Rocky Mountains rose in Colorado and New Mexico and streams brought eroded sediment from them to the Grand Canyon area.Supai Group formations in the western part of the canyon contain limestone, indicative of a warm, shallow sea, while the eastern part was probably a muddy river delta. This formation consists of red siltstones and shale capped by tan-colored sandstone beds that together reach a thickness of 600 to 700 ft (around 200 m). Shale in the early Permian formations in this group were oxidized to a bright red color. Fossils of amphibian footprints, reptiles, and plentiful plant material are found in the eastern part and increasing numbers of marine fossils are found in the western part.Formations of the Supai Group are from oldest to youngest (an unconformity is present at the top of each): Watahomigi (see 5a in figure 1) is a slope-forming gray limestone with some red chert bands, sandstone, and purple siltstone that is 100 to 300 feet (30 to 90 m) thick. Manakacha (see 5b in figure 1) is a cliff- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and red shale that averages 300 feet (90 m) thick in Grand Canyon. Wescogame (see 5c in figure 1) is a ledge- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is 100 to 200 feet (30 to 60 m) thick. Esplanade (see 5d in figure 1) is a ledge- and cliff-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is 200 to 800 feet (60 to 200 m) thick. An unconformity marks the top of the Supai Group. The answer is:","output":"The youngest formation of the Supai Group is the Esplanade Formation (see 5d in figure 1).

Stream of consciousness reasoning: To determine the number of calories an individual should consume daily, we must take into account various factors such as their age, sex, weight, height, and activity level. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories an individual needs to maintain their current weight while at rest. BMR varies based on age, sex, weight, and height. However, since the individual in question is moderately active, we also need to consider the calories they burn during physical activities. The Harris-Benedict Equation is often used to estimate the calorie requirements of individuals based on their BMR and activity level. Activity levels are classified into sedentary, lightly active, moderately active, very active, and extra active. An example calculation might consist of a 25-year-old female who is 5'6\\" tall, weighs 140 lbs, and engages in moderate physical activity. Her BMR, calculated using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, would be approximately 1,445 kcal/day. Based on her activity level, we can multiply her BMR by a factor of 1.55 (moderately active). The result is approximately 2,239 kcal/day as her daily energy needs to maintain her current weight. However, if we were to adjust her activity level and/or goals, we'd get a different daily caloric intake requirement. For example, if she wanted to lose weight at a moderate pace, she could reduce her caloric intake by around 20%. In this case, her daily calorie target would be approximately 1,791 kcal/day (20% reduction from 2,239 kcal/day). In conclusion, although the given answer of 1,200 calories might not be suitable for a moderately active adult to maintain their weight, a more accurate estimation can be determined by considering the individual's specific factors and adjusting their calorie consumption accordingly."},{"instruction":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Two-year-old Angelica and Angelina Sabuco were joined at the chest and abdomen.

From the days of 78 rpm discs, when relatively little modern music was being put on record, Walton was favoured by the record companies. In 1929 the small, new Decca company recorded eleven movements from Façade, with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble, with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton's friend and colleague Constant Lambert. In the 1930s, Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc, both on Decca, the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Viola Concerto with Frederick Riddle and the LSO conducted by the composer. In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older, larger rival, EMI. The EMI producer Walter Legge arranged a series of recordings of Walton's major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence (he used an earthier expression), Walter Legge would record it.Walton himself, although a reluctant conductor, conducted many of the EMI recordings, and some for other labels. He made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, the Façade Suites, the Partita, Belshazzar's Feast, and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and The First of the Few. Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc, including the Cello Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum.Almost all Walton's works have been recorded for commercial release. EMI published a \\"Walton Edition\\" of his major works on CD in the 1990s, and the recording of the Chandos Records \\"Walton Edition\\" of his works was completed in 2010. His best-known works have been recorded by performers from many countries.

Its provincial capital is Halifax. Nova Scotia is Canada's second-smallest province, with an area of , including Cape Breton and another 3,800 coastal islands. As of 2011, the population was 921,727, making Nova Scotia the second most-densely populated province in Canada with almost . - Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election. - The Nova Scotia Legislature, formally, known as the General Assembly, consists of the Crown represented by a Lieutenant Governor and the House of Assembly, is the legislative branch of the provincial government of Nova Scotia, Canada. The assembly is the oldest in Canada, having first sat in 1758, and in 1848 was the site of the first responsible government in the British Empire. - Andrew Younger is a Canadian politician , who was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in the 2009 provincial election . He represents the electoral district of Dartmouth East as an independent . He was previously part of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party caucus and had served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Energy and Minister of the Environment . - Dartmouth East is a provincial electoral district in Nova Scotia, Canada, that elects one member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. The riding is located in the Dartmouth region of the Halifax RM. What is the relationship between 'andrew younger' and 'member of the nova scotia house of assembly'? Answer:","output":"Andrew Younger is a Canadian politician who was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in the 2009 provincial election. He represents the electoral district of Dartmouth East as an independent.

The type of tree you grow should be reliant on the environment where you'll be keeping it. Your region's climate and your home environment should both be taken into account when you're deciding which species of tree to grow. To be on the safe side, select a species that is indigenous to your part of the world. Deciduous species such as Chinese or Japanese elms, magnolias, oaks, and crabapple trees are good selections if you'd like to grow your bonsai outside. Just be sure to pick out a species that can grow to full size in your region. If you prefer coniferous trees, junipers, pines, spruces, or cedars all make excellent choices. If you want to grow a tree indoors (or if you live in a hot climate), consider a tropical species. Jade, snowrose, and olive trees may be grown as bonsais. Planting a bonsai tree from seed is a slow but rewarding process. If you plant a tree, you'll have to allow it time to take root and grow strong before you can begin trimming and training. Depending on the species of tree you grow, this could take up to five years. Many find the extra wait and effort to be worth it since seeds are so inexpensive and the grower is able to control the tree at every stage of growth. To grow a bonsai from seed, take the following steps: Buy a package of bonsai tree seeds. Soak them overnight before planting them in soil with good drainage and the right nutrient composition for your tree species. Plant the tree in a training container (as opposed to a ceramic display container, which is only used once the tree has been trained and reached maturity). Give the planted tree the correct amount of sun, water, and a consistent temperature, again dictated by the specific species of tree. Allow the tree to become sturdy and strong before you begin to train it. This method of acquiring a bonsai tree is highly valued, since caring for a bonsai tree you find in the wild requires a lot of skill and knowledge. If collecting a tree that has had its start in nature appeals to you, consider the following factors: Select a tree with a sturdy trunk, but one that is still quite young. Older trees won't adapt well to being placed in a container. Choose a tree with roots that spread evenly in every direction, rather than growing laterally or entangled with the roots of other trees. Dig around the tree and extract a large amount of soil along with the roots. This will prevent the tree from dying of shock when it is moved to a container. Plant the tree in a large training container. Care for it according to the needs of the particular species. Wait about a year for the roots to get used to the container before you begin training it. This is the easiest way to begin the art of bonsai, but it is also the most expensive. Bonsai trees that have been grown from seed and partially trained have already received a lot of time and care, so they are usually quite pricey. Look online and in local nurseries and plant shops for a bonsai tree to bring home with you. If you buy a partially-trained bonsai from a shop, talk with the person who trained it about its specific needs. When you bring the bonsai home, give it a few weeks to adjust to the new setting before you begin working with it.","output":"Choose a tree species suitable for your environment and grow a bonsai from seed, find one in the wild, or buy a partially-trained one, considering factors such as climate, tree attributes, and caretaking steps specific to the tree species."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"The museum was filled with inaccurate biographical details and poorly-shot photographs.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The museum had lots of photos that were out of focus.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"The museum was filled with inaccurate biographical details and poorly-shot photographs\\" is true, it provides us with a reasonable basis to examine the hypothesis \\"The museum had lots of photos that were out of focus.\\" To analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let's break down the components of the premise: 1. Inaccurate biographical details: This suggests that the information provided about the subjects displayed in the museum is incorrect or unreliable. However, this element of the premise does not directly relate to the quality of the photographs. 2. Poorly-shot photographs: This suggests that the photographs displayed in the museum are of low quality or exhibit poor technical execution. This component of the premise does indeed relate to the hypothesis, as photographs that are poorly shot can also be considered out of focus. Now let's consider the hypothesis: \\"The museum had lots of photos that were out of focus.\\" This statement implies that the photographs within the museum exhibit a lack of clarity, sharpness, and well-defined details—a common characteristic of poorly-shot photographs. Even though the hypothesis does not specifically mention \\"poorly-shot photographs,\\" the correlation between out-of-focus photographs and poorly-shot photographs is quite strong. Out-of-focus photographs can be considered as one of the aspects contributing to the larger category of poorly-shot photographs. Thus, it can be inferred that a museum with poorly-shot photographs may display a significant number of out-of-focus photos. It is important to note that although out-of-focus images are likely to be present in a museum with poorly-shot photographs, other technical issues might also be prevalent, for instance, incorrect exposure, poor composition, or ineffective lighting, among others. As such, the hypothesis could be true to some extent (in the presence of out-of-focus photographs), but it may not encompass the entire range of issues associated with poorly-shot photographs. In conclusion, if the premise \\"The museum was filled with inaccurate biographical details and poorly-shot photographs\\" is true, it is reasonable to believe that the museum had a significant number of out-of-focus photos, as these would be consistent with the poorly-shot photographs description. However, it is also important to recognize that other technical issues might be present, which would contribute to the broader category of poorly-shot photographs."},{"instruction":"Question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

I remember the occasion when Mother sent me to the main road, about twenty yards away from the farmhouse, to invite a passing group of seasonal work-seekers home for a meal. She instructed me to take a container along and collect dry cow dung for making a fire. I was then to prepare the meal for the group of work-seekers. The thought of making an open fire outside at midday, cooking in a large three-legged pot in that high heat, was enough to upset even an angel.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Coalition Deaths Mount in Afghanistan After Tragic Crash Kills US Servicemen Introduction: The deadly crash of a U.S. military helicopter in Southern Afghanistan on Monday, resulting in the loss of several American lives, further underscores the challenging conditions and dangers faced by Coalition forces in the region. With no enemy activity reported at the time of the incident, the crash marks a somber milestone in the ongoing conflict, bringing the total number of Coalition deaths this year to 18. Background: The region of Southern Afghanistan has long been a precarious and dangerous environment for the U.S. military, as well as for other military forces participating in the ongoing operation. Coalition forces stationed in the area have continued their efforts to maintain peace and security, collaborating with local Afghan forces to counter the insurgent threats posed by various armed groups. The Military Investigation: U.S. military officials confirmed that those killed in Monday's crash were, indeed, American servicemen, while also stating that there was no reported enemy activity in the area at the time of the incident. This preliminary finding suggests that factors unrelated to combat might have contributed to the tragic event. Authorities will likely carry out a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the accident, focusing on factors such as mechanical failure, potential pilot error, or environmental challenges. The Cost of Conflict: With the latest event bringing the tally of Coalition deaths in Afghanistan in 2013 to 18, the human cost of the ongoing mission becomes all the more apparent. This figure underscores the importance of continuing support for the families of fallen servicemen and women and highlights the ongoing risks faced by thousands of military personnel stationed in Afghanistan. Moving Forward: While details of the crash continue to surface, efforts to establish long-term stability in Afghanistan will require continued partnership between coalition forces and local Afghan security units. As the military works to identify and address any potential issues that could have contributed to the crash, many hope that incidents like this can be prevented in the future, thereby better safeguarding the lives of the brave men and women working to promote peace in Afghanistan. Conclusion: As a stark reminder of the dangers associated with military service in Afghanistan, the tragic loss of several American servicemen in this week's crash will surely be mourned by their families, communities, and fellow service members. While the cause of the accident remains to be determined, the sacrifices made by these individuals will not be forgotten, and their dedicated efforts towards a more stable Afghanistan will undoubtedly serve as an inspiration for those who continue the mission in these challenging circumstances."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"A man wearing black walking past an alleyway between two buildings.\\" is it true that \\"The man is walking between the bank and the store.\\"?

It gained popularity in Korea because 40-bit encryption was not considered strong enough, so the Korea Information Security Agency developed its own standard. However, this decision has historically limited the competition of web browsers in Korea, as no major SSL libraries or web browsers supported the SEED algorithm, requiring users to use an ActiveX control in Internet Explorer for secure web sites. - In botany, a drupe (or stone fruit) is an indehiscent fruit in which an outer fleshy part (exocarp, or skin; and mesocarp, or flesh) surrounds a shell (the pit, stone, or pyrene) of hardened endocarp with a seed (kernel) inside. These fruits usually develop from a single carpel, and mostly from flowers with superior ovaries (polypyrenous drupes are exceptions). The definitive characteristic of a drupe is that the hard, \\"lignified\\" stone (or pit) is derived from the ovary wall of the flowerin an aggregate fruit composed of small, individual drupes (such as a raspberry), each individual is termed a drupelet and may together form a botanic berry. - Pan de coco , literally \`\` coconut bread '' in Spanish , is a rich sweet roll with a coconut filling . - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - The Arecaceae are a botanical family of perennial climbers, shrubs, acaules and trees commonly known as palm trees (owing to historical usage, the family is alternatively called Palmae). They are flowering plants, a family in the monocot order Arecales. Currently 181 genera with around 2600 species are known, most of them restricted to tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate climates. Most palms are distinguished by their large, compound, evergreen leaves, known as fronds, arranged at the top of an unbranched stem. However, palms exhibit an enormous diversity in physical characteristics and inhabit nearly every type of habitat within their range, from rainforests to deserts. - The coconut tree (\\"Cocos nucifera\\") is a member of the family Arecaceae (palm family) and the only species of the genus \\"Cocos\\". The term coconut can refer to the whole coconut palm or the seed, or the fruit, which, botanically, is a drupe, not a nut. The spelling cocoanut is an archaic form of the word. The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word \\"coco\\" meaning \\"head\\" or \\"skull\\", from the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features. What is the relationship between 'pan de coco' and 'cocos nucifera'? The answer is:","output":"The relationship between 'pan de coco' and 'cocos nucifera' is that 'pan de coco' is a sweet bread roll with a coconut filling, and 'cocos nucifera' is the coconut tree, which is a member of the family Arecaceae (palm family) and the only species of the genus \\"Cocos.\\" The coconut from the 'cocos nucifera' tree is used as the filling in 'pan de coco.'"},{"instruction":"Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to grow vegetables in small gardens Pick vegetables that you like.

Wonder no longer. It's a 7-inch Tegra 3 tablet running Android Jelly Bean, and it's set to hit Australia in July. Update: Turns out that this leak was spot on. The Google Nexus 7 built by Asus is a reality, with all the specifications listed here revealed days before this morning's I/O keynote by Gizmodo Australia. Check out the Nexus 7 and read how it all unfolded in our live blog. Gizmodo Australia has today viewed a training document detailing exactly what's going to be in the new tablet and how much it's going to cost. As rumoured, Google's going to announce a 7-inch, Nexus-branded tablet called the Nexus 7. According to the leak, it's built by Asus, with a 1.3Ghz quad-core Tegra 3 processor, GeForce 12-core GPU and 1GB of RAM with two different storage variants: 8GB and 16GB. The Nexus tablet will also feature NFC and run Google Wallet (probably only in the US) and Android Beam. The screen is an IPS display with a 178-degree viewing angle, running a resolution of 1280x800. The device will also sport a 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera. The battery will also give you nine hours worth of operation. The 8GB model will set you back US199 and the 16GB will cost US249. No word in the document on local prices. The leaked document also says that the device will be the first to run Jelly Bean, the new version of Android. Details are scarce on Jelly Bean, but the slides tell us that Google will handle operating system updates from now on, which could address the fragmentation problem. We aren't sure if this statement means that Google will handle all handset updates from Jelly Bean onwards, or if it just means it will handle it for the Nexus 7 going forward. Based on the various arrangements with other manufacturers and telcos around the world, it's likely to be the latter. We'll know more come Google I/O. Update: The document says that the Nexus 7 will run Android Jelly Bean, but makes no mention of the version number. We understand that the device will be version stamped with Android 4.1, rather than leaping ahead a generation and stamping it as 5.0. Wired had suggested after spotting a leaked benchmark that this would be the case. Rumours about Google working on a Nexus-branded tablet with Asus have been swirling for a while. Even as far back as May, a report emerged of a super cheap Tegra 3-powered device was coming at the Google I/O developer event, which is now only days away. The first clue was when Asus demonstrated the awesome cheap and wonderfully cheerful Eee Pad MeMO 370T at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, before delaying the unit indefinitely. Since then, rumours about a home-grown tablet from Google have been few and far between, but this is the first time we've seen anything official regarding specs. Apple has already played its announcement cards around iOS 6, Microsoft has announced Surface and Windows Phone 8, and Google risks being left behind without its own bespoke tablet product. June is one hell of a month to be following what's new in tech. Priced at sub-US200, the Google's Nexus 7 will become Amazon's biggest problem post-launch, threatening the market share of the hugely successful Kindle Fire. The Fire runs a highly modified version of the Android operating system and prevents users from wandering outside the customised Amazon environment. The Nexus brand, however, has always been associated with the purest form of the Android operating system Google has to offer, meaning that it's likely going to be a better experience. Google is also banking on the fact that the screen is better than the Fire's, with a higher resolution and 10-point touch capability. Of course, this could all prove to be an elaborate fake. We've seen them before and we'll see them as long as there's a rabid tech-loving public that will queue up around the block for value this good. We'll bring you the news as we hear it about this tablet, and if it really is the Nexus 7, I'm looking forward to this year's Google I/O. Follow Gizmodo Australia on Twitter for further updates. ||||| Computerworld - A 199 Nexus 7 tablet from Google would raise the stakes for Amazon's Kindle Fire and Barnes & Noble's Nook tablet, which sell at a similar price and screen size. But since the 7-in. touchscreen device is reportedly a quad-core tablet with other costly hardware, the Nexus 7 might also in some ways compete with the popular Apple iPad or perhaps the Microsoft Surface tablets unveiled last week. The iPad starts at 499; pricing for the Surface has not yet been announced. To offer high-end features at a low cost with the Nexus 7, Google seems to be acknowledging that the Android strategy of having third-party companies make tablets hasn't worked. And that means Google must take aggressive pricing steps to make up the difference. \\"If Google wants to jump-start the Android tablet market, which has been weak to date, then a low-priced, high-quality device could do that,\\" said Jack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates. \\"Google certainly has an incentive to make the Android tablet a competitive product in the market, and maybe driven more by wanting to capture a bigger share of the pie, than by supporting its OEMs (Original Equipment Makers).\\" Google could be subsidizing the Nexus 7 to the tune of hundreds of dollars per tablet, some analysts said. Even so, \\"getting revenues is the name of the game for Google, and right now the OEMs are driving very little revenue to them on Android-based tablets,\\" Gold said. The big payback to Google from selling a 199 tablet would come from the sales of apps and the ads that Google sells for its search tool, analysts noted. \\"Considering that the tablet ecosystem war is getting heated now with Microsoft having a bigger role, Google might feel the need for a more aggressive [pricing] strategy,\\" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner. She said that 40 million iPad sales in 2011 at a cost of 499 or more show there's room for Android sales, especially at lower prices. \\"You would think that 40 million would not seem impossible for the combination of all the vendors supporting Android,\\" she said. IDC said iPads accounted for 59% of tablet sales globally in 2011. Among Android tablets, Samsung had 6.3% of the market, and Asus took 2.5%. Amazon had 6.9% of the market with its Android variant and Barnes & Noble had 4.9%. \\"Google has to be more than a little frustrated that the first mainstream hit Android tablet is the Kindle Fire,\\" said Tom Mainelli, an analyst at IDC. \\"Google is desperate to get some market traction for Android tablets and the Google ecosystem that supports them.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"Google has announced a new tablet called the Nexus 7. It is a small tablet, with a 7-inch screen, and it is made by a company called Asus. The Nexus 7 will have a special computer chip called Tegra 3 and will run on a new system called Android Jelly Bean. This tablet will come in two different storage sizes: 8GB and 16GB. It will also have a camera on the front for video calls. The Nexus 7 will cost 199 for the 8GB version and 249 for the 16GB version.

The business grew quickly and interest spread in high fidelity sound and the do-it-yourself market for pickups, turntables, amplifier kits, loudspeaker enclosure plans, and AM/FM radio tuners. The LP record for longer works, 45 rpm for pop music, and FM radio became high fidelity program sources in demand. Radio listeners heard recordings broadcast and this in turn generated more record sales. The industry flourished. What aided in records sales in the 1950s?","output":"In the 1950s, record sales were helped by a few things. First, the invention of the Columbia LP, which allowed more music to fit on a single record. This made it easier for different companies to make long playing records. Second, people became interested in high quality sound, so they started buying more records with better audio. They also started building their own music systems with pickups, turntables, and speakers. Lastly, when people heard music on the radio, they liked it and wanted to buy those records too.

Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - Major is a military rank of commissioned officer status, with corresponding ranks existing in many military forces throughout the world.

A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America.

His intelligent and original physiognomy deserves to be taken in profile or head-on. The head is strong; the deep forehead is that of a thinker; the mouth large and smiling, the nose regular; the years have whitened the beard and hair ... the gaze fine, a little mocking. His stooped walk, his puritan comportment, give him the look of an Anglican minister or a rabbi – for which he has the abilities. Alkan was not always remote or aloof. Chopin describes, in a letter to friend, visiting the theatre with Alkan in 1847 to see the comedian Arnal: \\"[Arnal] tells the audience how he was desperate to pee in a train, but couldn't get to a toilet before they stopped at Orléans. There wasn't a single vulgar word in what he said, but everyone understood and split their sides laughing.\\" Hugh Macdonald notes that Alkan \\"particularly enjoyed the patronage of Russian aristocratic ladies, 'des dames très parfumées et froufroutantes [highly perfumed and frilled ladies]', as Isidore Philipp described them.\\"Alkan's aversion to socialising and publicity, especially following 1850, appeared to be self-willed. Liszt is reported to have commented to the Danish pianist Frits Hartvigson that \\"Alkan possessed the finest technique he had ever known, but preferred the life of a recluse.\\" Stephanie McCallum has suggested that Alkan may have suffered from Asperger syndrome, schizophrenia or obsessive–compulsive disorder.Alkan's later correspondence contains many despairing comments. In a letter of about 1861 he wrote to Hiller: I'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous ... nothing worthwhile, good or useful to do ... no one to devote myself to. My situation makes me horridly sad and wretched. Even musical production has lost its attraction for me for I can't see the point or goal.\\", what would be the answer ?

Piece A she simply puts on her desk to use later, and Piece B she slowly passes through the coil of wire. and a hint : Our knowledge of electromagnets developed from a series of observations. In 1820, Hans Oersted discovered that a current-carrying wire produced a magnetic field. Later in the same year, André-Marie Ampere discovered that a coil of wire acted like a permanent magnet and François Arago found that an iron bar could be magnetized by putting it inside of a coil of current-carrying wire. Finally, William Sturgeon found that leaving the iron bar inside the coil greatly increased the magnetic field. Please answer this question : Which piece of iron is more magnetized? Answer:","output":"Piece B is more magnetized. This is because it was passed through the coil of wire with electricity running through it. Based on the historical knowledge provided, when a current-carrying wire is coiled, it acts like a permanent magnet, and if an iron piece is placed inside or passed through that coil, it gets magnetized. This phenomenon was discovered by François Arago and built upon by William Sturgeon, who found that having the iron bar inside the coil increases the magnetic field. In this situation, Kelsey passed Piece B through the coil of wire, which caused it to be magnetized, whereas Piece A was simply placed on her desk without any interaction with the magnetic field, so it remains less magnetized."},{"instruction":"Premise: A young man takes an airborne leap while snowboarding.

In the first sentence, \\"The rate of production at the factory is skyrocketing,\\" the word \\"rate\\" refers to the speed or efficiency at which something is being produced. In this context, \\"rate\\" denotes a measurable metric of performance. 2. In the second sentence, \\"He works at a great rate,\\" the word \\"rate\\" can be understood to mean the speed, pace, or efficiency at which someone works. Although the meaning is related to the first sentence, it is more subjective, as \\"great rate\\" could mean different things to different people. The context possibly implies that the person works at a quick, efficient pace, positively impacting their productivity. Conclusion: While the word \\"rate\\" serves a similar purpose in both sentences, it is not exactly identical in meaning.

Shaving will quickly remove hair from your stomach, though it may require more frequent upkeep than other methods, depending on the texture and amount of hair. Only shave your stomach hair when your skin is wet, which can help soften the follicles, making removal easier. Only shave your stomach hair in the direction in which the hair grows. This can lessen irritation and the likelihood of cutting yourself. Use a clean razor with sharp blade to help prevent infection and likelihood of cutting yourself. Consider using an electric razor or clipper if your stomach hair is especially thick and copious. If you don’t have a large amount of hair on your stomach, you can simply pluck it either with tweezers or have someone pluck the hair by threading. These methods pluck the hair below the surface at the follicle and thus only require upkeep whenever new hair grows. You can pluck stomach hairs with tweezers or make an appointment at a local salon or spa that offers hair removal services. Threading, which is an ancient form of hair removal, rotates a looped piece of thread across the skin to pluck hairs. Inquire with local salon or spa if they offer threading services. Depending on where you live, it may be difficult to find a trained threader. Be aware that plucking and threading can be painful and irritate skin, though threading may be a better option for sensitive skin. Like plucking, waxing and sugaring remove hair at the follicle, which can hinder hair growth for longer than shaving. Waxing and sugaring can be very effective if a large portion of your stomach has hair and may also reduce overall growth if done over a longer period of time. Waxing involves applying a thin layer of warm, melted or cold wax to your skin and then pulling it off in the opposite direction of the hair growth. This uproots hair at the follicle. Like waxing, sugaring entails the application of a thin layer of heated sugar mixture that is then lifted off your skin to remove the hair. Sugaring may be a better option for more sensitive skin. Choose to wax or sugar yourself or have a professional remove stomach hair using these methods. Trim long or thick stomach hair before waxing or sugaring for better results and less pain. You can purchase home waxing and sugaring kits at many pharmacies. Most salons and spas will offer waxing and sugaring services, which can be expensive, but effective. Be aware that waxing and sugaring can be very painful, especially during initial treatments and on very sensitive stomach skin. In most cases, you’ll need to undergo treatments every 4-6 weeks to remove your stomach hair. Do or have a small skin test with a wax or sugar mixture to ensure that you don’t have an allergic reaction to it. In addition, you should never use wax or sugar on broken or inflamed skin because it can exacerbate irritation. Depilatories are chemical formulations that break down the protein structure of hair and dissolve it into a jellylike mass. This can be a quick and painless way to remove stomach hair, especially if it is thick and spread across a wide area. Depilatories come in various forms including gels, creams, lotions, aerosols, and roll-ons. Because you are putting a chemical on your skin, it is important to first do a patch test to see if your skin reacts. You also shouldn’t use a depilatory on broken or inflamed skin. Apply the depilatory to the stomach hair you want to remove. Leave on the product for the length of time the packaging recommends and then wipe or rinse it off, along with the hair mass. If your skin burns at any time, remove the product immediately. Depilatory creams keep hair growth at bay for anywhere from 1 day to 10 days. Summary:","output":"To remove stomach hair, you can shave, pluck, wax, sugar, or use depilatories. Shaving is quick but requires frequent upkeep. Wet your skin, shave in the direction of hair growth, and use a clean, sharp razor. Plucking or threading can be done at home or a salon, but may cause pain and irritation. Waxing and sugaring involve applying a mixture to the skin and removing it, uprooting hair at the follicle. These methods can be painful, but result in longer-lasting hair removal. Depilatory creams are a painless option for removing hair by dissolving it, but be cautious of skin reactions. Always perform a patch test for new products and avoid using them on broken or inflamed skin."},{"instruction":"Produce a detailed sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Olive Grove, eatType = pub, food = Japanese, priceRange = less than £20, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes","output":"The Olive Grove, a family-friendly riverside pub, offers a diverse range of scrumptious Japanese dishes at an affordable price range of less than £20 per person, making it a delightful dining option for those seeking to explore exquisite culinary experiences while enjoying the serene view of the waterfront."},{"instruction":"Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the band that has received six APRA Awards ? from the following article ? In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony. Answer:","output":"The answer to the question is: Silverchair is the name of the band that has received six APRA Awards. Here is how I determined the answer: Step 1: Identify the main subject of the article. In this case, the article discusses a band and its creative process, focusing on a specific member, Johns. Step 2: Look for the band's name in the article. The name \\"Silverchair\\" is mentioned in the text, specifically in reference to Gillies, who is a part of the band. Step 3: Confirm that the band's name, Silverchair, is the one that has received six APRA Awards. The article states, \\"The band have received six APRA Awards...\\" Answer: Silverchair is the name of the band that has received six APRA Awards."},{"instruction":"If \\"Two soccer players are vying for the ball.\\", does it logically follow that \\"Two soccer players are playing in a stadium\\"?","output":"To determine if it logically follows that \\"Two soccer players are playing in a stadium,\\" let's analyze the given statement step by step: Step 1: Understand the given statement The statement is, \\"Two soccer players are vying for the ball.\\" This means that two soccer players are competing to gain possession of the ball.

It includes principles behind law that make the law. Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as jurists or legal theorists (including legal philosophers and social theorists of law), hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, of legal reasoning, legal systems, and of legal institutions. Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems in two rough groups: - The Quran (; ', literally meaning \\"the recitation\\"; also romanized Qur'an or Koran\\"') is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (\\"Allah\\"). It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature. The Quran is divided into chapters (\\"surah\\" in Arabic), which are then divided into verses (\\"ayah\\"). - Fiqh is Islamic jurisprudence. While \\"Sharia\\" is believed by Muslims to represent divine law as revealed in the Quran and the \\"Sunnah\\" (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), \\"fiqh\\" is the human understanding of the \\"Sharia\\"\\"sharia\\" expanded and developed by interpretation (\\"ijtihad\\") of the Quran and \\"Sunnah\\" by Islamic jurists (\\"Ulama\\") and implemented by the rulings (\\"Fatwa\\") of jurists on questions presented to them. - Sabzevar County is a county in Razavi Khorasan Province in Iran. The capital of the county is Sabzevar. At the 2006 census, the county's population (including portions of the county later split from it to form Joghatai County, Jowayin County, Khoshab County, and Davarzan County) was 429,187, in 116,891 families; excluding those portions, the population was 273,898 in 75,668 families.

They are the guardians of legal and religious tradition in Islam. Often they are \\"Imams of important mosques, judges, teachers in the religious faculties of universities\\". The term may also include the body of Muslim Islamic scholars trained in the whole body of Islamic law and in other Islamic disciplines; but it may also be used to include the village mullahs and imams on the lowest rungs of the ladder of Islamic scholarship, inasmuch as they correspond most closely to the class of the scribes or rabbis in Judaism. - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders. - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia.

Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - The Arab world ('; formally: '), also known as the Arab nation (\\"\\"), consists of the 22 Arabic-speaking countries of the Arab League. These Arab states occupy an area stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Arabian Sea in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean in the southeast. The contemporary Arab world has a combined population of around 422 million people, over half of whom are under 25 years of age. - Muhammad (c. 570 CE 8 June 632 CE) is the central figure of Islam and widely regarded as its founder by non-Muslims. He is known as the \\"Holy Prophet\\" to Muslims, almost all of whom consider him to be the last prophet sent by God to mankind to restore Islam, believed by Muslims to be the unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets.

It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity.

Written primarily by George Mason, the resolutions rejected the British Parliament's claim of supreme authority over the American colonies. More than thirty counties in Virginia passed similar resolutions in 1774, \\"but the Fairfax Resolves were the most detailed, the most influential, and the most radical.\\" - The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as \\"habeas corpus\\". Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles. The political myth of Magna Carta and its protection of ancient personal liberties persisted after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies and the formation of the American Constitution in 1787, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States. Research by Victorian historians showed that the original 1215 charter had concerned the medieval relationship between the monarch and the barons, rather than the rights of ordinary people, but the charter remained a powerful, iconic document, even after almost all of its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries. - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America. - The Mason family of Virginia is a historically significant American political family of English origin, whose prominent members are known for their accomplishments in politics, business, and the military. The progenitor of the Mason family, George Mason I (5 June 16291686), arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on the ship \\"Assurance\\" in 1652. Mason was a Cavalier member of the Parliament of England during the reign of Charles I of England. George Mason I's great-grandson was George Mason IV (11 December 17257 October 1792), an American patriot, statesman, and delegate from Virginia to the U.S. Constitutional Convention. Along with James Madison, George Mason IV is known as the \\"Father of the Bill of Rights.\\" For these reasons, Mason is considered one of the \\"Founding Fathers\\" of the United States and raised the Mason family to national political prominence. - The Bill of Rights is the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the oftentimes bitter 178788 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights 1689, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215). - George Mason I (5 June 1629 1686) was the American progenitor of the prominent American landholding and political Mason family. Mason was the great-grandfather of George Mason IV, a Founding Father of the United States. - George Mason ( sometimes referred to as George Mason IV ) ( December 11 , 1725 -- October 7 , 1792 ) was a Virginia planter , politician , and a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787 , one of three men who refused to sign . His writings , including substantial portions of the Fairfax Resolves of 1774 , the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 , and his Objections to this Constitution of Government ( 1787 ) in opposition to ratification of the constitution , have been a significant influence on political thought and events . The Virginia Declaration of Rights served as a basis for the United States Bill of Rights , of which he has been deemed the father . Mason was born in 1725 , most likely in present - day Fairfax County , Virginia . Mason 's father died when he was young , and his mother managed the family estates until he came of age . He married in 1750 , built Gunston Hall , and lived the life of a country squire , supervising his lands , family and slaves . Mason briefly served in the House of Burgesses and involved himself in community affairs , sometimes serving with his neighbor , George Washington . As tensions between Britain and the American colonies grew , Mason came to support the colonial side , and used his knowledge and experience to help the revolutionary cause , finding ways to work around the Stamp Act of 1765 and serving in the rebel Virginia Conventions of 1775 and 1776 . Mason prepared the first draft of the Declaration of Rights in 1776 , and his words formed much of the text adopted by the final Virginia Convention . He also wrote a constitution for the state ; others who sought to have the convention adopt their ideas , like Thomas Jefferson , found Mason 's version could not be stopped . During the war , he was a member of the powerful lower house of the Virginia General Assembly , the House of Delegates , but to the irritation of Washington and others , refused to serve in the Continental Congress in Philadelphia , citing health and family commitments . Named one... - The Colony of Virginia (also known frequently as the Virginia Colony, the Province of Virginia, and occasionally as the Dominion and Colony of Virginia or His Majesty's Most Ancient Colloney and Dominion of Virginia) was the first permanently settled English colony in North America. Newfoundland, with seasonal settlements, had been established as a colony by Royal Charter in 1583. American archaeologist William Kelso says Virginia \\"is where the British Empire began ... this was the first colony in the British Empire.\\" The colony existed briefly during the 16th century, and then continuously from 1607 until the American Revolution (as a British colony after 1707). The name Virginia was first applied by Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth I in 1584. After the English Civil War in the mid 17th century, the Virginia Colony was nicknamed \\"The Old Dominion\\" by King Charles II for its perceived loyalty to the English monarchy during the era of the Commonwealth of England. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The Virginia Declaration of Rights is a document drafted in 1776 to proclaim the inherent rights of men, including the right to reform or abolish \\"inadequate\\" government. It influenced a number of later documents, including the United States Declaration of Independence (1776) and the United States Bill of Rights (1789). - The Bill of Rights is an Act of the Parliament of England that deals with constitutional matters and sets out certain basic civil rights. Passed on 16 December 1689, it is a restatement in statutory form of the Declaration of Rights presented by the Convention Parliament to William and Mary in February 1689, inviting them to become joint sovereigns of England. The Bill of Rights lays down limits on the powers of the monarch and sets out the rights of Parliament, including the requirement for regular parliaments, free elections, and freedom of speech in Parliament. It sets out certain rights of individuals including the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment and reestablished the liberty of Protestants to have arms for their defence within the rule of law. Furthermore, the Bill of Rights described and condemned several misdeeds of James II of England. - The Declaration of Independence is the statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress meeting at the Pennsylvania State House (Independence Hall) in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies, then at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain, regarded themselves as thirteen newly independent sovereign states, and no longer under British rule. Instead they formed a new nationthe United States of America. John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence, which was passed on July 2 with no opposing vote cast. A committee of five had already drafted the formal declaration, to be ready when Congress voted on independence. The term \\"Declaration of Independence\\" is not used in the document itself.

The 31-year-old's new deal means both he and Hamilton are under contract until the end of the 2018 season. Rosberg leads the 2016 championship by one point from Hamilton going into Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix. The pair are dominating F1, having won nine of the opening 10 races, but their relationship is a fractious one, punctuated by a number of on-track clashes. Rosberg said the new contract was a \\"special moment for me\\", adding: \\"I look forward to the future.\\" In a statement, Mercedes said: \\"Nico has been a core member of the Silver Arrows since the team returned to the sport in 2010 and has played a crucial role in the team's success in that time.\\" Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff told BBC Sport: \\"Contract negotiations are never a formality because it is important for the driver and the team. It took a couple of months and we signed it last night. \\"I am in for long-term stability especially with the regulations change. I am a faithful person and if it functions well with your wife you need to stay with your wife.\\" Wolff also said he had no concerns about Rosberg and Hamilton's contracts expiring at the same time. \\"It means they will try to outperform each other and you have to think to the younger generation,\\" he said. \\"For me, there is more opportunity than risk in having both run out at the same time.\\" BBC Sport's chief F1 writer Andrew Benson: Rosberg's new deal is no surprise given it has been telegraphed by both team and driver for some time. He is also leading the world championship - and Mercedes could not afford to let a man who might win it leave at the end of the season. The former Williams driver, who has 19 F1 wins in his career, has had a sometimes difficult relationship with Briton Hamilton, but it is a relationship Mercedes feel they can control. The driver line-up is perfect for them. In Hamilton, they have arguably the fastest driver in F1. In Rosberg, they have a man who can win when Hamilton hits trouble and who is good enough to beat him on merit from time to time. Retaining both drivers gives the team stability ahead of 2017, when a new set of regulations will dramatically change the cars. It's the obvious choice. Rosberg's deal means all three top teams have confirmed driver line-ups for 2017. Red Bull are retaining Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen, while Ferrari have confirmed Kimi Raikkonen as partner for Sebastian Vettel. The only active world champion without a drive at this stage is Britain's Jenson Button, whose McLaren contract expires at the end of this season. McLaren are likely to promote their Belgian reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne to partner double world champion Fernando Alonso, although chairman Ron Dennis told BBC Sport two weeks ago they would not decide until September. Button also has interest from Williams, who are likely to drop Brazilian veteran Felipe Massa. Finn Valtteri Bottas is under option and is likely to be retained.

Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them. Question: How structured was Jenny's life in school? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"Jenny's life in school was highly structured.

Who plays Rachel in Friends","output":"Jennifer Aniston plays the character of Rachel Green in the television sitcom Friends. She is one of the six main characters of the show, which aired from 1994 until 2004. Jennifer Aniston was born on February 11, 1969, in Sherman Oaks, California. She is the daughter of Greek American actor John Aniston and English actress Nancy Dow. Prior to her role in Friends, Aniston started her acting career in several off-Broadway productions, such as For Dear Life and Dancing on Checker's Grave. She made her television debut with a guest appearance in the show Molly in 1990 and later acted in several other TV series and movies, including Ferris Bueller, The Edge, and Leprechaun. Aniston's portrayal of Rachel Green, a somewhat naive but fashionable woman who goes through a significant transformation throughout Friends, proved to be a career-defining role. The character was originally a rich girl who finds herself cut off from her family's wealth and subsequently tries to make her own way in life. Throughout the show's ten seasons, Rachel's love interests, friendships, career, and personal growth were central storylines. Her performance in Friends earned Aniston numerous awards and nominations, including a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 2002 and a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series in 2003. Aniston also won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series along with the rest of the Friends cast in 1996, 2000, and 2001.

Here's how we fit the story to the scenarios: Scenario 1: Individual's belief matches reality. Scenario 2: Individual's belief does not match reality. Scenario 3: False belief about another individual's beliefs. - The blue_envelope initially contains the pineapple (step 8). - Emily moves the pineapple from the blue_envelope to the red_box (step 10). - Avery enters the bedroom only after Emily moves the pineapple to the red_box (step 12). So Avery is unaware of Emily's action. - Emily sees the pineapple in the red_box when she re-enters the bedroom (step 19). - Avery moves the pineapple from the red_box back to the blue_envelope (step 21). Avery knows Emily wants the pineapple, but he doesn't know that Emily already saw the pineapple in the red_box. Answer: Avery thinks that Emily searches for the pineapple in the blue_envelope. This is because he is unaware that Emily already knows about the pineapple being moved to the red_box (scenario 3)."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: Great juicer, if you would like pieces of vegetables blow all over your entire kitchen from the air vent of the machine.

It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back.

Take the world’s greatest playwright, William Shakespeare. Centuries after he made his name, he is being blamed for bringing misery to millions. Not, as some might expect, from being forced to study his works at school, but for suffering stigma over unsightly skin. In what is a departure from the numerous studies looking at everything from leprosy to skin cancer, medical experts are claiming that Shakespeare’s success has resulted in a painful legacy for people will skin disease. The playwright is the subject of new research being revealed to hundreds of doctors during the annual conference of the British Association of Dermatologists. The rash of Shakespearean insults based on people’s appearance, whether it is King Lear branding his daughter Goneril “an embossed carbuncle” or a prostitute calling a soldier a “scurvy companion” in Henry IV part II, is cited as a cause of the continuing persecution of people for the way they look. In a paper entitled \\"Is Shakespeare to blame for the negative connotations of skin disease?\\", British researchers from the universities of Nottingham, Leicester and Derby claim that Shakespeare reflected the Elizabethan obsession with flawless pale skin, and while he “may not have accepted Elizabethan society’s negativity towards skin disease, it can be argued that his success has led to its perpetuation”. Dr Catriona Wootton, a dermatologist at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, and co-author of the study, said: \\"Elizabethan London was a melting pot for diseases such as plague, syphilis and smallpox. Many of the diseases of the time involved lesions or sores on the skin, so skin imperfections were seen as a warning sign for contagious disease.” Shakespeare used these “negative undertones to his advantage, employing physical idiosyncrasies in his characters to signify foibles in their behaviour,” she added. A spokesperson for the British Association of Dermatologists said: “Much of the Elizabethan stigma over disfiguring skin disease still persists today. Even now, many examples exist in films and literature where visible disfigurements are used to represent villainy or malice. Nobody is suggesting that we edit Shakespeare but maybe we should ensure that new films and books don't reinforce this stereotype.\\" But fans of the playwright are rallying to his defence. Stuart Hampton-Reeves, head of the British Shakespeare Association, told The Independent: “Shakespeare was a product of his era so we cannot expect him to confirm to modern attitudes and it is far-fetched to blame modern day prejudices on Shakespeare's works.” And Professor Michael Dobson, the director of Birmingham University’s Shakespeare Institute, said: “Has any writer in history ever suggested that the symptoms of skin disease are attractive? And have audiences for the last 400 years really been coming out of theatres saying ‘Ah yes – I’d nearly forgotten – pox is to be avoided. What a genius Shakespeare was!’ Next week: has the fairy tale of Snow White been creating a misleadingly favourable impression of dwarfism?” Pox, carbuncles and plague: Shakespeare's lack of skin care Some of Shakespeare’s most memorable lines are insults over people’s appearance. Take King Lear for instance, when the beleaguered monarch berates his daughter Goneril: “Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle”. From phrases like “scurvy knave” used in Romeo and Juliet, to “a pox upon him” in All's Well That Ends Well and “foul moles and eye-offending marks” in King John, skin problems are referenced throughout Shakespeare’s plays. In Henry IV part I, a man with a red nose is dubbed “an everlasting bonfire-light” and “knight of the burning lamp”. And in Coriolanus, Marcius (Coriolanus) curses his enemies: “Boils and plagues Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd.” Herpes is alluded to in A Winter’s Tale: “If I prove honey mouthed let my tongue blister”. While in A Midsummer's Night Dream, a blessing to young couples includes the line: “Never mole, hare-lip nor scar... shall upon their children be”. ||||| Shakespeare may be partly to blame for the social stigma associated with disfiguring skin conditions, say experts. They point to memorable insults in his plays that refer to skin blemishes and scarring, reflecting an Elizabethan obsession with flawless pale complexions. One of the most graphic occurs when King Lear launches into his scheming daughter Goneril, declaring: ''Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle''. Other examples include use of the phases ''a pox upon him'' in All's Well That Ends Well and ''scurvy knave'' in Romeo and Juliet, while in Henry IV part one a man's red nose is described as ''an everlasting bonfire light''. Marcius Coriolanus wishes ''boils and plagues'' upon his enemies, and a young couple in A Midsummer's Night Dream are exhorted to have children with ''never mole, hare lip nor scar..'' Dermatologist Dr Catriona Wootton, from Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, who took part in a language analysis of Shakespeare's plays, said: ''Rat-infested and with open sewers, overcrowding and sexual promiscuity, Elizabethan London was a melting pot for diseases such as plague, syphilis and smallpox. ''Many of the diseases of the time involved lesions or sores on the skin, so skin imperfections were seen as a warning sign for contagious disease. This was not limited to signs of infection, but to any blemishes or moles, which were considered ugly and signs of witchcraft or devilry. ''Shakespeare uses these negative undertones to his advantage, employing physical idiosyncrasies in his characters to signify foibles in their behaviour.'' The researchers argue that the Bard's colourful language has helped to perpetuate negative attitudes towards imperfect skin. Nina Goad, from the British Association of Dermatologists, said: ''It is interesting to note that much of the Elizabethan stigma over disfiguring skin disease still persists today. Over the last few decades dermatologists have tried to address the effect this can have on patients. However, even now, many examples exist in films and literature where visible disfigurements are used to represent villainy or malice. ''This is particularly concerning when such films are aimed at children, who learn that beautiful, flawless people are kind and trustworthy, and scarred or blemished people are to be feared. ''Nobody is suggesting that we edit Shakespeare, but maybe we should ensure that new films and books don't reinforce this stereotype. Many skin patients require psychological support to deal with the visual aspect of their disease.'' The findings were presented at the British Association of Dermatologists' annual conference in Glasgow. ends ||||| A new study by British dermatologists draws a connection between the bad attitude shown towards skin conditions in Shakespeare's works and the way we think of it today. Do we have a negative view of acne because of the writings of Shakespeare? A study by dermatologists in the UK recently examined whether our culture views skin blemishes negatively because of the amount of negative writings in Shakespeare’s plays about skin conditions. “While Shakespeare may not have accepted Elizabethan society’s negativity towards skin disease, it can be argued that his success has led to its perpetuation,” the study reads. The dermatologists note that many of the Bard’s works include people insulting others by mentioning skin conditions or by trying to curse someone with a skin affliction. A character says he wishes “a pox upon” another character in “All’s Well That Ends Well,” while in the text of “King John,” one character says that if another was “patch’d with foul moles and eye-offending marks, then I should not love thee, nor thou become thy great birth, nor deserve a crown.” However, they write that the playwright does say in “Hamlet” that those with skin conditions are not evil because of them, writing, “that for some vicious mole of nature in them, as in their birth – wherein they are not guilty, since nature cannot choose hisorigin – their virtues else, be they as pure as grace, as inﬁnite as man may undergo, shall in general censure take corruption from that particular fault.” Fear of those with skin conditions arose from the dangers of diseases like the plague, write the dermatologists. “Tell-tale cutaneous signs heightened the fear of contagion,” they wrote. According to the Telegraph, British Association of Dermatologists member Nina Goad urged that the attitude not be passed down to future generations. “Even now, many examples exist in films and literature where visible disfigurements are used to represent villainy or malice,” she said. “This is particularly concerning when such films are aimed at children, who learn that beautiful, flawless people are kind and trustworthy, and scarred or blemished people are to be feared. Nobody is suggesting that we edit Shakespeare, but maybe we should ensure that new films and books don't reinforce this stereotype.” However, some are doubtful of the dermatologists’ connection between Shakespeare and fear of skin afflictions. Guardian writer Alison Flood wrote that she found the conclusion “a stretch.” “It sort of assumes we might not have noticed that skin diseases aren't exactly the most pleasant thing in the world, if it wasn't for Mercutio gasping ‘A plague on both your houses,’” she wrote. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A study by British researchers suggests that William Shakespeare's plays have contributed to the social stigma associated with disfiguring skin conditions.

Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

Capitalize this past sentence correctly.","output":"\\"Heat a serving of apple juice with the spices. Leave to brew.\\" This sentence should start with a capital letter at the beginning of each sentence and the personal pronoun 'I', if used, should be capitalized. Here, there are two sentences: \\"Heat a serving of apple juice with the spices.\\" and \\"Leave to brew.\\" Each sentence should start with a capital 'H' and 'L' respectively. It's also essential to have a full stop (a period) at the end of each sentence as it indicates a completed thought or statement. This shows that each sentence is grammatically correct, and sentences should be capitalized correctly to follow the standard rules of English language and grammar. Additionally, paying attention to these small details, like capitalization, can make your writing clearer and easier to read. It can help to distinguish between different sentences and the start of new thoughts. Plus, it just makes your writing look neater and more professional. Therefore, ensuring correct capitalization is important for maintaining the integrity and clarity of the written content. Even though the content itself does not change, proper capitalization enhances reader comprehension and creates a more refined appearance to your writing. Note: Individual spices, if mentioned by name, may require capitalization if they are brand names or have a particular designation. Otherwise, general terms for spices do not need to be capitalized. In this sentence, no specific spice is mentioned, so no additional capitalizations are needed."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a text of article and corresponding title of an article.

Question: Which of the islands that the cyclone passed over or near has a higher population? Passage:During April 5, 2017, the Fiji Meteorological Service started to monitor Tropical Disturbance 20F that had developed about to the northwest of the Fijian dependency of Rotuma. The system lied within an area of favourable conditions for further development with low to moderate vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures of about . Over the next couple of days, the system moved south-westwards and gradually developed further, before it was classified as a tropical depression by the FMS during April 7. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) subsequently issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance, as atmospheric convection consolidated around the system's elongated low level circulation center. During that day, the system was steered south-westwards towards Vanuatu and New Caledonia, by northeasterly winds located to the northwest of a subtropical ridge of high pressure. The system subsequently passed near or over the islands of Maewo and Ambae, before the JTWC initiated advisories on the depression and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 16P early on April 8. The system subsequently passed near or over Malakula, before the FMS reported that it had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone, on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Cook.

If you have an empty basin that can hold 260 gallons of water. The basin leaks water at 4 gallons per second. how long would it take to fill the basin with water from the waterfall in seconds? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"To solve this problem, first, we need to find the net rate at which the basin fills with water by considering both the inflow from the waterfall and the outflow due to the leak. The inflow of water from the waterfall is 24 gallons per second, while the outflow due to the leak is 4 gallons per second. To find the net rate at which the basin fills with water, we need to subtract the outflow from the inflow: Net fill rate = Inflow - Outflow Net fill rate = 24 gallons per second - 4 gallons per second Net fill rate = 20 gallons per second Now that we know the net fill rate, we can determine how long it takes to fill the 260-gallon basin. To do this, we divide the basin's capacity by the net fill rate: Time to fill the basin = Basin capacity / Net fill rate Time to fill the basin = 260 gallons / 20 gallons per second Time to fill the basin = 13 seconds So, it would take 13 seconds for the waterfall to fill the 260-gallon basin considering the leak."},{"instruction":"This is an email Jack, Did you send over your comments?

He founded the pioneering band Death in 1983. Schuldiner is often referred to as \\"The Godfather of death metal\\", and his obituary in the January 5, 2002 issue of UK's Kerrang! magazine said that \\"Chuck Schuldiner was one of the most significant figures in the history of metal.\\" Schuldiner was born on May 13, 1967, on Long Island, New York to a Jewish father of Austrian descent and a mother from the American South, a convert to Judaism. Both of his parents were teachers. In 1968, his family moved to Florida. Schuldiner was the youngest of three children: he had an older brother named Frank and an older sister named Bethann. He started playing guitar at the age of 9; his 16-year-old brother had died and his parents bought him a guitar, thinking it would help with his grief. He took classical lessons for less than a year in which his teacher taught him \\"Mary had a Little Lamb\\", which he did not like very much, and almost stopped completely, until his parents saw an electric guitar at a yard sale and bought it for him. The young Schuldiner immediately took to the instrument. After getting amps, he never stopped playing, writing and teaching himself. Schuldiner was known to spend the weekend in the garage or his room playing his guitar, but was limited to three hours on weekdays when school was in session. Schuldiner first played in public in his early teens. Schuldiner was originally inspired by Metallica, Iron Maiden, Kiss and classical jazz, among others. He was particularly interested in the metal movement known as NWOBHM - New Wave of British Heavy Metal - and cited bands of that genre among his favorites. He frequently cited French band Sortilege as his personal favorite metal group. Slayer, Celtic Frost, Possessed, Mercyful Fate/King Diamond and Metallica were later influences he would apply more to his own band. Later in his career, Schuldiner frequently cited progressive metal bands such as Watchtower, Coroner and Queensryche as influences. The official Schuldiner website, Empty Words, quotes Schuldiner's mother making the claim that he enjoyed all forms of music except country and rap. He also enjoyed jazz and classical music in addition to metal and British alternative acts such as Lush. Schuldiner performed well in school before becoming bored with education, and eventually dropped out. He later regretted this decision. He has stated that if he had not become a musician, he would have liked to have become a veterinarian or a cook.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was he raised in NY or did they move somewhere else","output":"Chuck Schuldiner was born in Long Island, New York, but when he was a little kid, around 1 year old, his family moved to Florida."},{"instruction":"How many employees infosys have in USA?

Enthusiasm from the reviewer: The review demonstrates a high level of enthusiasm in the author's capitalized writing style and use of exclamation marks. This indicates that they had an enjoyable experience with the game, which might intrigue potential buyers. 2. Hours of gameplay: The reviewer mentions that the game offers \\"hours of fun,\\" suggesting that it has longevity and engaging content, which is generally a positive quality for entertainment products. 3.

Different players have different tastes and might not share the same level of enthusiasm for the particular game. 2. Limited information: The reviewer does not provide specific details about the game, such as its title, developer, or the type of game it is (e.g., first or third-person shooter). This may lead to potential confusion or misunderstandings about the product. 3.

Eliot started his career as the editor of The Criterion in 1922. Thomas Stearns Eliot, an American-British poet, essayist, playwright, and literary critic, is considered one of the most influential poets of the 20th century. Born on September 26, 1888, in St. Louis, Missouri, Eliot moved to England in 1914, where he would spend the majority of his life. In 1915, Eliot published \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,\\" which marked a significant turning point in the literary landscape and catapulted him to fame. With his distinctive style marked by the use of fragmentation, allusion, and a combination of high culture and popular culture references, Eliot contributed greatly to the development of modernist poetry. In 1922, T.S. Eliot founded The Criterion, a literary magazine, which provided a platform for modernist writers from England, Europe, and the United States to showcase their work. As editor, Eliot sought to establish a forum for intellectual exchange and dialogue, challenging the conventions of literature and fostering the development of innovative ideas. The magazine garnered a strong reputation, despite its relatively small circulation, and soon became one of the most influential literary publications in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s. Under Eliot's editorial guidance, The Criterion published works by several notable writers, such as Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, D.H. Lawrence, and Aldous Huxley. The magazine also provided Eliot a platform to publish his own work, which, at the time, included the groundbreaking poem \\"The Waste Land\\" in 1922, a contentious yet pivotal piece of modernist literature. Eliot faced some challenges in maintaining the journal's independence as he sought financial support to keep the publication going. Despite the financial struggles, The Criterion retained its editorial vision and continued publishing important literary works until its final issue in January 1939. T.S. Eliot's career as a poet, essayist, editor, and critical thinker saw him gain numerous accolades, including the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948 for his extensive influence on the world of poetry. Apart from his work with The Criterion and his famed poems like \\"The Waste Land\\" and \\"Four Quartets,\\" Eliot also wrote essays on various literary subjects and authored influential plays like \\"Murder in the Cathedral\\" and \\"The Cocktail Party.\\" His extensive contributions to literature and his diverse body of work continue to be celebrated, analyzed, and admired."},{"instruction":"From the following options, what is the question \\"Why did David Koresh ask the FBI for a word processor ?\\" asking about?

Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs. In 2010, Kelly became the highest ranking U.S. military officer to lose a child in combat operations in Southwest Asia. His youngest son, 1st Lieutenant Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in action in Afghanistan on Nov. 9, 2010. The younger Kelly was a Marine and was on his third combat tour, but on his first combat tour as a Marine Corps infantry officer. Since his son's death, Kelly has talked in stark terms about the... Question: Who is Robert Michael Kelly? Options: A. He's a lieutenant who was killed in Afghanistan on his third combat tour B. not enough information C. Member of the Obama administration D. He was in military jail was Guantanamo Bay in Cuba === The correct answer is A:","output":"Robert Michael Kelly was a lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps who was tragically killed in action in Afghanistan during his third combat tour. Born to one of the U.S. military's longest-serving commanders, retired Marine General John Kelly, Robert Michael Kelly embarked on his first combat tour as a Marine Corps infantry officer before his untimely death on November 9, 2010. As the son of an esteemed military figure and the highest-ranking U.S. military officer to lose a child in southwest Asia combat operations, his heartbreaking story highlights the sacrifices that individuals and their families make in serving their country. Although there isn't much information available about Robert Michael Kelly's personal life, his legacy lives on through his father, General John Kelly. The general has spoken in stark terms about the reality of combat and the devastating impact it can have on families. This perspective undoubtedly has influenced his approach to military strategy and, later, his role in the Trump administration as the leader of the Department of Homeland Security. General Kelly's vast military experience, combined with his firsthand understanding of the sacrifices made by those who serve, have helped shape his policies and priorities in leading the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In summary, Robert Michael Kelly was a lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps who was killed in action while serving in Afghanistan on his third combat tour. He was the son of retired Marine General John Kelly, and his tragic story serves as a reminder of the personal sacrifices made by military personnel and their families."},{"instruction":"This is the content of an email: Good afternoon, I am circulating a draft of the long term agreement for your review.

He unties a shoe in his lap, carefully loosening the laces with a precision that comes from years of experience. The room around him is quiet and dimly lit, with only a faint muzzle of light filtering in through the slightly ajar curtains. The walls are adorned with family portraits and well-weathered books line the shelves, giving off a warm, nostalgic atmosphere. As the man continues to work on the shoe, his mind wanders back to his childhood, where he spent countless hours outside, running through the fields and exploring the woods that surrounded his childhood home. The untied shoe in his hands now acts as a metaphorical gateway, transporting him to those moments of freedom and joy that often seem so distant in his current life. His fingers glide effortlessly through the shoelaces, each movement accompanied by the memory of a laughter-filled sprint through the grass or a triumphant race to the end of the block. As the final loop comes undone, he lifts the shoe from his lap and inspects it closely, searching for any wear or tear along the edges. The shoe, itself, has seen better days; it has carried him through countless adventures and witnessed the same joys and sorrows. With a deep, cleansing breath, the man places the shoe on the floor beside its well-matched counterpart and marvels at how such a simple object can hold so much weight in the tapestry of his life. The shoe is more than just a tool or accessory, it is a symbol of his journey, an emblem of his story that longs to be shared with others. His gaze moves from the shoe to his old bike leaning against the far wall, collecting dust and memories in equal proportion. The once-shiny metal frame now bears witness to the passage of time with its chipped paint and rusted spots; the tires, deflated and worn, quietly await their chance to roll along the sun-kissed pavement once more. The man stands up, feeling a sudden surge of determination. Reaching for the laces of his shoes, he begins to lace them up. With every pull, he feels a renewed sense of purpose, a drive to rekindle the adventures of his youth and to make new memories that will stand the test of time. As the last lace is tucked neatly into place, he looks towards the bedroom door, already imagining the wind in his hair and the sun on his face as he embarks on his next journey. The brisk, invigorating vitality of youth now radiating within him, the man opens the door and steps out, ready to once again chase his dreams and embrace the boundless possibilities that await him."},{"instruction":"Q:Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

The reviewer appreciates certain elements of the episode, such as Ruth Gordon's performance, the music, and the moodiness. However, they criticize a significant plot hole, which they believe undermines Columbo's supposed hidden genius.

Despite this flaw, they still seem to enjoy certain aspects of the episode, making the sentiment not entirely negative but rather a mix of appreciation and critique."},{"instruction":"Given the background: Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. and the situation: Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. Answer the following question: Which researcher studied less about abrasion? The answer to this question is:","output":"Manny studied less about abrasion."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Finnish: The issue raised by the honourable Member is undoubtedly of considerable importance, not only to the individual named in her question but also in so far as it is likely to have a direct impact on other citizens of the Union in a similar position.","output":"Step 1: Identify the main components of the sentence. - The issue raised by the honourable Member - is undoubtedly of considerable importance - not only to the individual named in her question - but also in so far as - it is likely to have a direct impact on other citizens of the Union - in a similar position Step 2: Translate each component of the sentence to Finnish. - Kunnian arvoisan jäsenen esiin tuoma kysymys - on epäilemättä suurella merkityksellä - ei ainoastaan hänen kysymyksessään mainitulle yksilölle - vaan myös sikäli kuin - sen todennäköisesti vaikuttavan suoraan muihin liiton kansalaisiin - samankaltaisessa asemassa Step 3: Combine the translated components to form the Finnish sentence.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. Question: \\"Where did Mohamed Atta reside while in Germany?\\" Answer: \\"He stayed with his father\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, this answer is not correct. While in Germany, Mohamed Atta initially resided with a German family he had met in Cairo.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Don't Change the Subject Context: The movie begins with frank, humorous interviews of two men who set out to kill themselves and then moves into a Day Of The Dead celebration where the guests celebrate the lives of those whom they have lost. Director Stutz questions his family about his mother's suicide in 1979 and how little they've actually discussed it, visiting his mother's grave site with his sister and listening to old tapes of their mother. He talks to several survivors and experts before commissioning several artists to come up with works about suicide: A band (The Bigfellas) agrees to make a song about suicide \\"that you can dance to\\"; an illustrator (Patrick Horvath) is to make short animated films (which run through the documentary as interstitials); a choreographer (Danielle Peig) chooses to create a dance piece based on two autopsy reports; and a standup comedian (Duncan Trussell) compiles material for his act about suicide with the help of several top comedy writers. Meanwhile, Stutz continues to interview and engage his family about his mother's death, eventually staging his mother's suicide (where he discovered her unconscious at the age of 12) on screen with members of the \\"avant-garde circus\\" troupe, The Lucent Dossier Experience. As some of the interviews take a turn from the dark to the more cathartic, the tone of the movie brightens at the end during the performances of the artistic material. The interview subjects give positive, inspiring messages to the audience about things they can actively do to help prevent suicides and connect more deeply with those they love.

Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined. and a hint : Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Punisher Context: When Bobby Saint and Mickey Duka meet with European arms dealer Otto Krieg at the Tampa, Florida seaport, the FBI intervenes and Saint is killed while Duka is jailed. \\"Krieg\\", supposedly killed in the shootout, is actually undercover FBI agent and former U.S. Army Delta Force operator Frank Castle. Shortly thereafter, he retires from the FBI and attends a family reunion at his father's oceanside home in Aguadilla Bay, Puerto Rico. Tampa crime boss Howard Saint is enraged by the death of his son, and with right-hand man Quentin Glass bribes the FBI for confidential information about \\"Krieg\\". Saint orders Castle murdered, and Saint's wife, Livia, demands Castle's entire family be killed as well to \\"settle the score.\\" At the reunion, gunmen including Glass and John Saint, kill most of the extended family.

Abigail Page is a brash and flighty public relations woman. Page is determined to secure Willoughby's participation in a prestigious fishing tournament, only to discover that Willoughby is a phonyâhe's never fished in his life. By threatening to reveal his secret, Abigail forces Roger to fake his way through the tournament. Willoughby proves himself to be supremely inept: he cannot fish, cannot set up a tent, cannot run or even board a motorboat. He cannot even swim, as he demonstrates by toppling or plunging straight to the lakebed each time he ventures to go fishing. In the vein of the screwball genre, the dialog is fast and overlapping, the humor broad and slapstick, multiple levels of deception abound, and a decidedly adversarial relationship constantly teeters on the edge of romance. \\"It'll be all over in a moment!\\" Faux fisherman Roger Willoughby (Rock Hudson) suffers at the hands of publicist Abigail Page (Paula Prentiss) in Howard Hawk's Man's Favorite Sport?

The film begins with the opening credits of a typical Star Wars fanfilm entitled \\"Bond of the Force\\". Gregory plays Jacen Solo, and Jennifer plays the offscreen voice of Jaina Solo. Jacen is on a forest planet searching for Anakin Solo, but only encountering a Sith Lord named Darth Katai, played by Zarth. The two begin to duel, and it is an intense battle...until Greg misses his cue, incurring the wrath of writer-director Tom \\"Servo\\" Harrison. Tom gets into a fight with his friends, and they walk out on him. After a monologue based on High Fidelity, with Star Wars in the place of rock music, Tom reflects back a few months to the genesis of the fanfilm project. Tom, Greg, Jenny, and Zarth are seen hanging out at Excalibur Games, a hobby shop, playing the Star Wars pants game. Tom is revealed to be an employee at the store, working for store credit while he has his money saved up for film school. He claims the only downside to the job is the trekkies—specifically, two irate, Star Wars-hating ones named James and Stewart. The two enter the store, arguing over a discrepancy between the film Star Trek Generations and the Technical Manual. While waiting for Tom to get their new Star Trek cards, Stewart accidentally spills soda on a set of comics that Greg's boss ordered. Tom demands they pay for the damaged goods, and the Trekkies overpay him before leaving the store in a rush. Tom realizes that they can sell the undamaged books to Greg's boss for full price and pocket the money from the Trekkies. At Greg's suggestion, Tom combines the money with his remaining store credit and buys model lightsabers, which prompts the idea in his mind of making a Star Wars fanfilm.","output":"In the given article, the duel on a forest planet in the Star Wars fanfilm \\"Bond of the Force\\" is between two characters – Jacen Solo, played by Gregory, and Darth Katai, played by Zarth. Therefore, the full names of the two people who begin the duel are: 1. Gregory as Jacen Solo 2. Zarth as Darth Katai The film sets the stage for an intense battle between the two characters, with Jacen Solo representing the Light Side of the Force and Darth Katai representing the Dark Side. However, the duel is interrupted when Gregory misses his cue, leading to a conflict among the friends behind the film's production. This event becomes a turning point in the story, as it leads the writer-director Tom \\"Servo\\" Harrison to reflect on the genesis of the fanfilm project and the various events and experiences shared by the characters involved in its creation."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Street art can be found on buildings, street signs and even dustbins from Tokyo to Paris to New York City. This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture. It is supported by websites, artist groups, books and magazines. Question: According to the writer, the artists love street art because _ . - they enjoy travelling around the city - they want to express their feelings freely - they enjoy learning different cultures - they want to let more people know them A:","output":"According to the writer, the artists love street art because they want to express their feelings freely. The text specifically states \\"What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits\\". This implies that artists appreciate the unbounded liberty street art provides for showcasing their thoughts, emotions, perspectives, and creativity without any major restrictions. While other possible options like travel around the city, learning different cultures or gaining public recognition through their art might be part of some artists' experiences, the text clearly emphasizes the primary reason as the freedom of self-expression."},{"instruction":"Context: On 23 June 1596, an Ottoman Army marched from the city of Istanbul. Commanded by Sultan Mehmed III, the army marched through Edirne, Filibe , Sofia and Niš to arrive at Belgrade on 9 August. On 20 August, the army crossed the River Sava by bridge and entered the Austrian territory of Siren. A war council was called at Slankamen Castle, and it was decided that they would begin a siege on the Hungarian fort of Eger . The fort controlled the communication routes between Habsburg Austria and Transylvania, all of whom were in revolt against the Ottoman suzerainty. However, news soon arrived that the Austrians had besieged and succeeded in taking over the Castle of Hatvan and had killed all the Ottomans housed there, including the women and children. The Ottoman Army started a siege on the fort of Eger on 21 September 1596, and by 12 October the castle had capitulated. As a retaliation to the Hatvan castle massacre, the defenders of this castle were all executed. Not long after, Ottoman command received the report that a mixed army of Austrians and Transylvanians were advancing towards the Ottoman expeditionary force. A war council was conducted under Grand Vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha. It was decided that the Ottoman Army should march out of the Erlau castle so as to meet the Austrians at a suitable battle terrain. The Sultan thought that the Ottoman army should disengage and return to Istanbul; it was with great difficulty that he was persuaded to engage the enemy forces. The most realistic troop strength figures seem to be 40,000-50,000 for the Christian and 80,000-100,000 for the Muslim army. The Christian army had 10,000 Austrians, 4,000 Germans, 3,000 reiters, 13,000 Hungarian light cavalry and 10,000 Transylvanians, for a total of 40,000 men.

Context: Apologies again that it’s been a while since I last posted. You may recall that I’d been helping out a local charity with their website? Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians., can you guess it ?

For example: \\"Excuse me but I was next in line and I'm in just as much of a hurry as the person who pushed in.\\" Avoid whispering, mumbling, or speaking too quickly. The tone of your voice and the speed of your delivery are an important part of clarifying what you want and how confident you're feeling. Naturally, the manner in which you defend yourself will depend on the situation and if someone is volatile, always put your safety first. You should never resort to outright aggression in the process of standing up for yourself. Being aggressive, or even violent, is counter-productive and will not win you any friends. Acting aggressively -- verbally or otherwise -- is like acting out your pain in full technicolor. It's not a constructive way to get what you want and will simply turn people against you. You are far more likely to achieve a positive result if you approach any issues as calmly and objectively as possible. You can still stand your ground and be firm and assertive without having to raise your voice or get angry. Be wary of taking passive aggressive responses toward people and situations. Passive aggressive responses are ones in which you begrudgingly do things against your will and end up filled with resentment and anger, hating people who \\"make\\" you feel this way, feeling depressed and helpless. This negatively affects your relationships and can take a huge toll on your physical and emotional health. Most of all, a passive-aggressive approach to life will never enable you to stand up for yourself. Another way of standing up for yourself is to take the negatives thrown at you and transform them into good things. In the process of turning attacks inside out to find the good, you'll often find that feelings of jealousy or insecurity are at the root of the attack. For example: If someone claims you're bossy, rather than letting it cause you to shrink some more, take this as evidence that you're a natural leader, able to manage people and projects well, and a proactive change agent. If someone claims you're shy, take it as a compliment that means you're not ready to jump on the latest bandwagon but like to reflect over the consequences first and then make up your mind. If someone says you're too sensitive or emotional, let this be a sign that you've got a big heart and aren't afraid to let everyone see it. Or maybe someone suggested you're not career-minded enough – for you, that confirms you're living a stress-free life that will help you to live longer. No matter how hard you try to increase your confidence, there will be days when you feel that you're backsliding. Rather than seeing this as a defeat in your attempt to learn to stand up for yourself, see it for what it is – a day or so where things went temporarily off-track before you feel better and bounce back. Some tricks to help the bounce-back process include: Fake it till you make it. Even if you don't feel confident, act as if you do. Be consistent in your approach. People will grow to expect that the person you are now is a person who stands up for himself. Expect some people to find your more assertive stance challenging. It can take time to reshape the patterns you've formerly established with people who used to walk all over you. In some cases, you'll find you no longer want to be a part of their lives; take it as it comes.

The sightings follow a series of drone spottings at French atomic plants last year and, more recently over the presidential palace and a bay in Brittany that houses nuclear submarines. Authorities have been left scratching their heads as they remain unable to catch any of the operators or determine whether the flyovers are the work of pranksters, tourists or something more malicious. Flying drones over the French capital is banned by law, and the latest sightings come at a time of heightened vigilance following last month's jihadist attacks. A police source told AFP that witnesses and security forces reported at least five sightings overnight Tuesday to Wednesday over central Paris -- that may have been the same drone or several. The tiny aircraft were spotted near the US embassy, not far from the Invalides military museum, the Eiffel Tower and several major thoroughfares leading in and out of the French capital, the source added. Police had already been trying to find out who was behind the appearance of an estimated five separate drone flights over similar areas of Paris the previous night. - Probe underway - View gallery France has launched a one-million-euro programme aimed at detecting and intercepting pilotless drone … \\"People should not be worried but vigilant, it's an issue which is taken very seriously,\\" government spokesman Stephane Le Foll told reporters, adding a probe was under way to find the operators. He said drone flyovers had taken place in other countries such as Germany, where a small unmanned aircraft operated by activists denouncing police surveillance landed just several metres away from Chancellor Angela Merkel during a 2013 campaign event. And last month, a small drone crash-landed on the grounds of the White House, prompting a security lockdown. French authorities were first alerted to mystery drone flyovers in October, when state-run power company EDF filed a complaint with police after detecting the small aerial vehicles zipping over seven atomic plants. The sightings continued into November, and altogether some 20 flyovers took place over nuclear plants. Their operators were never found. In October, a 24-year-old Israeli tourist spent a night in jail and was slapped with a 400-euro (450) fine for flying a drone above the Notre Dame cathedral. Then on January 20, a pilotless aircraft briefly went over the presidential palace in Paris, not long after jihadist attacks that left 17 people dead and put the country on high alert. And at the end of January, small drones were also spotted near a bay in Brittany that houses four nuclear submarines -- one of the most protected sites in the country. - 'Eye on the sky' - With many more police and troops out on the streets of Paris following the shootings, drone sightings may be more likely. \\"Many sensitive sites are protected and from now on we are asking law enforcement to have an eye on the sky as well,\\" said a police source. French law prohibits small civilian drones from sensitive areas such as nuclear facilities, which are protected by a no-fly zone that spans a 2.5-kilometre (1.6-mile) radius and a height of 1,000 metres. Faced with the difficulty of intercepting drones and their operators, France has launched a one-million-euro programme aimed at developing ways of detecting them. The pilotless aircraft come in all shapes and sizes, and have a variety of uses, from military applications to surveillance, filmmaking, sports, disaster relief and scientific research. The most basic unmanned aircraft are radio-controlled by someone nearby, but other more sophisticated models can be pre-programmed and the operator can be miles away. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Some of the latest sightings were again around the Invalides military museum Drones have appeared over landmarks in central Paris for the second night running and police are no closer to knowing who is operating them. There were five sightings between 23:00 on Tuesday and 02:00 (01:00 GMT) on Wednesday, French media report. Up to three drones were seen near the Invalides military museum, Place de la Concorde and two of the old city gates. Flying drones over Paris at night is illegal and daytime flights require authorisation from the city. Five drones were seen the previous night in similar areas, including the Eiffel Tower and above the US embassy, close to Place de la Concorde. However, some of the latest drone flights have been captured on film and will be analysed by a 10-strong team of investigators set up after the first incidents. The new sightings were also on the fringes of central Paris, at the key transport gates of Porte de Clignancourt in the north and Porte de Saint-Cloud in the south-west. \\"There's no need to worry, but we should be vigilant. It's a subject being taken very seriously,\\" said government spokesman Stephane Le Foll. Part of the problem was that they were so easy to operate, he said, but everything was being done to catch those involved. Small drones are inexpensive but their appearance in recent months over sensitive locations has worried French authorities. It is against the law for any aircraft to fly lower than 6,000m (19,700ft) over central Paris. Flying any aircraft under that ceiling - including drones, police helicopters and air ambulances - requires permission from city authorities. Flying a drone at night is banned completely. Analysis: Hugh Schofield, Paris correspondent The security threat from these drones is minimal. Bird's-eye images of Paris landmarks are available online in far higher quality than anything these devices could produce. And small, shop-bought drones are not strong enough to deliver a significant payload of explosives. The more likely risk from these drones is that one might get out of control and crash on to a street, injuring a pedestrian or causing a car accident. That is the main reason why flying drones is banned over populated areas of France. The police cannot afford to ignore these overflights however. They are probably the work of drone enthusiasts giving the authorities the run-around, but not certainly. It could also be an organised group - eco-warriors or jihadists, for example - testing out how the security forces respond to drones. Security at key sites in Paris was tightened last month after the murders of 17 people by Islamist gunmen and French officials say that was the main reason the drones were spotted. Last month a drone was seen over the Elysee Palace, home of President Francois Hollande. In October, a 24-year-old Israeli tourist was fined €400 (£293; 453) and spent a night in jail after flying a drone over the city's historic Hotel Dieu hospital and a police station. Drones were also spotted flying over at least 13 nuclear power plants in France between October 2014 and January 2015. Those flights were thought to be the work of environmental activists but no group claimed responsibility. The latest incidents involve a group that is not lacking in money, according to aviation security specialist Christophe Naudin. Those behind them were seeking to \\"defy the power of the state\\", he told RTL radio, and trying to damage the French sense of security. Drones present a problem for authorities in built-up areas, in that shooting them down could endanger the public. It is possible to jam GPS or radio signals guiding them. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Drones were spotted flying over Paris for the second night in a row, and police are still unsure who is operating them.

Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

(but no U.S.) troops--that is, left them at the mercy of Serb paramilitaries, who systematically set about driving them from their homes and killing them.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The UN's Safe Haven policy did little to help Bosnian civilians.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, it can be argued that the UN's Safe Haven policy did little to help, and may have even harmed, Bosnian civilians during the Bosnian War. However, to confirm the hypothesis \\"The UN's Safe Haven policy did little to help Bosnian civilians.\\", it is crucial to examine the surrounding historical context, the intent behind the policy, its implementation, and its outcomes. The Bosnian War (1992-1995) resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia and the struggle for independence among its constituent republics. The war was characterized by widespread violence and ethnic cleansing, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which had a highly diverse population consisting of Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), Serbs, and Croats. The conflict saw the Bosnian Serb forces, backed by the Yugoslav People's Army, engage in numerous atrocities against Bosniak civilians, including mass killings, rapes, and forced displacement. In response, the United Nations established the \\"Safe Areas\\" in April 1993 through Resolution 819, focused on six Bosnian towns: Srebrenica, Žepa, Goražde, Bihać, Tuzla, and Sarajevo. The policy aimed to protect Bosnian civilians from harm by providing refuge and humanitarian aid under the presumed protection of UN peacekeeping forces. However, the UN was criticized for not adequately supporting or reinforcing these so-called \\"Safe Areas.\\" The premise suggests that the Safe Havens policy was considered disastrous for several reasons: 1. Insufficient protection: The number of UN troops deployed to protect these designated areas was grossly inadequate in countering the threat posed by well-armed Serb paramilitaries. In many cases, the already small number of UN peacekeeping forces had been non-interventionist and were unable to provide meaningful protection to the civilians within their areas. 2. Lack of US troops: It is noted that there were no U.S. troops among the UN peacekeeping forces guarding the Safe Areas, which might have impacted the authority and effectiveness of their defense. 3. Vulnerable civilians: The policy placed masses of unarmed Bosnian civilians under the protection of insufficient UN forces, effectively putting them at the mercy of Serb paramilitaries. Consequently, many Bosnian civilians were subjected to forced displacement from their homes, torture, and murder. 4. Serb paramilitaries' actions: The Serb forces had exploited the inadequacies of the Safe Haven policy to drive Bosnian civilians out of their homes and carry out systematic killings, as the UN forces were unable to prevent these actions. One significant example of the policy's failure is the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, when more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were killed by Bosnian Serb forces who overran the \\"Safe Area,\\" which was guarded by a meager, ineffective Dutchbat contingent of UN peacekeeping forces. This event is now recognized as an act of genocide. In conclusion, the UN's Safe Haven policy, as implemented, did little to help and might have even exacerbated the suffering of Bosnian civilians. The hypothesis that \\"The UN's Safe Haven policy did little to help Bosnian civilians.\\" is supported by evidence of the policy's failure to: provide adequate protection, allocate sufficient resources and personnel, and ultimately prevent atrocities from occurring within its Safe Areas. This further highlights the need for robust international mechanisms to prevent and mitigate such humanitarian crises in the future."},{"instruction":"Would Kylee Jenner ask for no cream in her coffee?

Lord Hall of Birkenhead, the BBC’s director-general, said the new Internet-based service will allow U.S. audiences to access BBC programs that aren’t already screened on TV channels or available on existing streaming services. The new service is one of several initiatives the broadcaster is planning in order to raise more revenue internationally at a time when its public funding in Britain is under intense pressure. “We need to raise commercial income to supplement the license fee so we can invest as much as possible in content for U.K. audiences,” Lord Hall told the bi-annual Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge. The BBC gave few specific details about the initiative, but it is understood that it will not directly replicate the iPlayer, its hugely popular U.K. streaming service. Instead, the BBC is developing a new interface using a mix of its own and third-party technology. It will not, initially at least, include the most sought-after new BBC shows, such as Doctor Who and Sherlock, which are already tied up in lucrative rights deals with BBC America, the cable channel it co-owns with AMC, or other networks. However, the BBC’s catalogue includes thousands of hours of other shows that never reach the airwaves in the U.S., along with a sizeable back catalogue. However, the BBC hopes that its unique brand, reputation for making high-quality programs, and a vast library of content will give it a distinctive selling point for American subscribers. The corporation is trying to drive additional income with its public funding, amounting to about £3.7 billion a year, under pressure at home. The government is undertaking a ten-year review of the BBC’s funding, scope and purpose and critics argue that it should be scaled back. Lord Hall said the BBC is also planning to bolster its internal production division to generate more commercial income. At present, the corporation’s own in-house production teams make just over half of the programs that it screens on its TV channels. It has promised to commission more from external producers, but also wants approval from regulators for its internal production department to begin making shows for other networks. Internal production will be hived off into a new commercially-driven BBC Studios, which will have revenues initially of £400 million a year. The BBC wants to grow that significantly by chasing commissions from foreign TV networks and online platforms, to compete with the Hollywood studios. ||||| CAMBRIDGE, England (Reuters) - Britain’s BBC will launch an online subscription service in the United States next year, boosting revenues for the public broadcaster and allowing viewers to watch shows on demand. Barriers near to the main entrance of the BBC headquarters and studios in Portland Place, London, Britain, July 16, 2015. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls “We’re launching a new OTT (over-the-top) video service in America offering BBC fans programmes they wouldn’t otherwise get, showcasing British actors, our programme-makers and celebrating our culture,” the BBC’s Director General Tony Hall said at the industry’s RTS Convention in Cambridge. Some of the most-popular BBC content, such as “Doctor Who” and “Top Gear”, is already available on its BBC America digital network, a joint venture with AMC Networks. The BBC did not name any shows that would be on the new service. It did not say what the service would be called. The announcement comes as the BBC faces an uncertain future under a Conservative government which has embarked on the biggest review of the broadcaster in at least a decade, questioning its purpose, funding, size, Internet activities and even entertainment output. To that end, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale has raised the possibility of selling off BBC Worldwide, the BBC’s commercial arm that sells its programmes around the world. The 92-year-old corporation, whose television, radio and online services reach 97 percent of Britons, is fighting back by showing it can innovate in a multi-platform age. The online service, known in industry jargon as over-the-top, will come nine years after the iPlayer used by Britons, one of the earliest and most successful on-demand services. It will boost the broadcaster’s income and underline BBC Worldwide’s importance, Hall said. “While every major global player is creating a more integrated system, it would make no sense for us to go the other way and break up a system that is delivering returns that are essential to support public service programmes,” he said. Hall said the new service, and partnerships in countries such as India, would increase commercial returns from Worldwide to the BBC to 1.2 billion pounds (1.86 billion) over the next five years – more than 15 percent higher than the returns of the previous five years. The returns from BBC Worldwide supplement the BBC’s income from the licence fee that is paid by television-owning households in Britain, with the exception of people aged over 75. Its operating costs hit 4.9 billion pounds in the 2014/15 financial year, with staff numbers totalling 18,974, which is seen by some commercial rivals as a luxury at a time of volatile advertising markets and rapid industry change. ||||| It’s always been a tricky task to watch some of Britain’s best television unless it got picked up by Masterpiece Theater.

Some of its most popular shows like Doctor Who and Sherlock, which already air in this country, won’t be included, but there’s plenty more to watch: Few networks around the world can boast the kind of back catalogue the BBC has. The move is actually a revenue grab for the government-supported network, which is largely funded by public license fees paid by British viewers. Much like PBS in America, the BBC has seen its budget cut since the 2008 recession and is looking to raise money (roughly £3.7 billion) outside of the country, since it is mandated to air ad-free in the U.K. Though few details are available, the BBC will probably be offering a monthly subscription service, similar to the recently launched HBO Live and CBS Express streaming sites, which seek to appeal to younger “cord-cutting” TV watchers. The archives the BBC (affectionately called “The Beeb” in the U.K.) could offer up are staggering to contemplate. The network has offered original TV programming since 1929, starting only three years after the invention of the television, and it’s impossible to summarize its greatest hits. Yes, there’s many a famed costume drama in its vaults, along with legendary sitcoms and sketch shows. There are some of the earliest and most influential pieces of science fiction, and gritty real-life dramas. Highlights might include Andrew Davies’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, or Monty Python’s Flying Circus, or Ricky Gervais’s The Office, or the 12 glorious episodes of Fawlty Towers, or the epic masterpiece of social storytelling that is Peter Flannery’s Our Friends in the North. But the real allure of subscribing would be a barrel you could never scrape the bottom of no matter how hard you tried. That’d probably be worth a few bucks a month, especially in the coming days of à la carte television subscriptions, where viewers will pick and choose the networks they want to subscribe to online, rather than pay for a massive bundle of cable channels. In terms of sheer history, the BBC is unparalleled. Tapping its archives could offer extraordinary benefit for both the network and its many global fans. |||||","output":"The BBC plans to launch a Netflix-style video subscription service for American audiences next year in a bid to raise more revenue internationally at a time when its public funding in Britain is under pressure. The new initiative will allow US audiences to access BBC programmes that are not already screened on TV channels or available on existing streaming services. While few specific details have been given about the initiative, its understood the BBC is developing a new interface using a mix of its own and third party technology."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you will be presented with a question, a word, and a POS tag.

Article: The New York Times announced Wednesday that it intended to charge frequent readers for access to its website, a step being debated across the industry that nearly every major newspaper has so far feared to take. Starting in early 2011, visitors to NYTimes.com will get a certain number of articles free every month before being asked to pay a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access. Subscribers to the newspaper's print edition will receive full access to the site. But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand. Still, publishers fear that money from digital subscriptions would not make up for the resulting loss of audience and advertising income. NYTimes.com is by far the most popular newspaper site in the country, with more than 17 million readers a month in the United States, according to Nielsen Online, and analysts say it is the leader in advertising income, as well. That may make it better positioned than other general-interest papers to charge--and also gives The Times more to lose if the move produces an opposed result. The Times Company has been studying the matter for almost a year, searching for common ground between pro-and-anti pay campaigns--a debate mirrored in dozens of media-watching blogs-- and the system will not go into effect until January 2011. Executives said they were not bothered by the possibility of absorbing barbs for moving cautiously. \\"There's no prize for getting it quick,\\" said Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive. \\"There's more of a prize for getting it right.\\" Question: What is the main idea about the passage?

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent. We had ‘Unexpected Song’ played as she walked down the aisle at the church; the lyrics really summed up how we felt about each other and how we had gotten together… Unexpected Song Michael Crawford YouTube.

It is clear from your story that both you and your ex-wife had a deep bond, one based on trust, openness, and love, albeit in a different form than a traditional romantic relationship. Living an authentic life is essential to one's happiness and well-being, and it is understandable that you reached a point where you couldn't go on living the lie. It's important to remember, though, that life is a journey of growth and self-awareness, and sometimes we must go through difficult experiences to truly understand ourselves. It sounds like you ultimately came to terms with your sexual orientation and accepted that you are gay. This acceptance is a critical step in living a true and genuine life and finding happiness within yourself. It is also likely that you have experienced some degree of regret over marrying your ex-wife, given the knowledge you now have about yourself. However, it is important to focus on the positives that emerged from that relationship, such as your strong friendship and love for one another and, of course, the beautiful daughter you share. As for where your life took you after the story ended, it's difficult to say without more information. However, some possible outcomes could include: 1. Regretting getting married, but learning from the experience and growing as a person. Recognizing the importance of living authentically and finding happiness in that knowledge. 2. Attempting to reconcile with your ex-wife, but ultimately deciding that maintaining a strong friendship and co-parenting relationship is the best path for both of you. This could lead to both of you finding fulfillment and love in new relationships that align with your true selves. 3. Accepting that you are gay and beginning to explore what that means for your life. This could involve meeting new friends and potential romantic partners within the LGBTQ+ community, deepening your self-awareness, and learning to embrace your true identity. No matter the outcome, it seems evident that your story is one of growth, acceptance, and learning to navigate the complexities of life and relationships. It's essential to remember that we all make mistakes, but it is how we learn from those mistakes and grow as individuals that truly defines who we are. Remember, you are not alone in your journey, and there is support available, whether that be through LGBTQ+ organizations, counseling services, or other resources. By focusing on your journey towards self-acceptance and love, you will continue to find happiness and fulfillment in your life and grow as a person."},{"instruction":"in the case that your wcm file doesn't open, it is highly likely that you do not have the correct software application installed on your pc to view or edit wcm file extensions.

This involves not only acquiring the necessary skills such as flying and foraging for food but also acquiring the knowledge of its surroundings and learning how to evade predators and hazards. Upon successfully learning to fly and find food, the bird has now completed its fledgling stage. It is no longer dependent on its parents for protection and sustenance. At this stage, the bird starts to explore its environment, discovering its territory, and forming a mental map of where to find food, water, and safe resting spots. Another essential aspect of this final step is the bird's ability to communicate with other birds of its species. This interaction will enable the bird to learn the social nuances of its species, including mating calls, warning signals, and location-specific information. Socialization and communication are crucial aspects of the bird's integration into its broader bird community. As the bird continues to grow and mature, it will also develop its reproductive system and will eventually be able to reproduce and create offspring of its own. This reproductive milestone represents the full transition into adulthood and signifies that the bird is now fully capable of contributing to the continuation of its species. Furthermore, the bird will also learn to adapt to changing seasons, habitat conditions, and potentially migration patterns, depending on the species. The ability to survive in various conditions and adapt to an ever-evolving environment is a clear indication of the bird's completion of its early life stages and its entry into adulthood. In summary, the final step of the described process comprises the bird becoming a fully independent, self-sufficient, and adaptable creature, capable of surviving in its habitat, contributing to the community of its species, and ensuring the continuation of its lineage through reproduction. This stage marks the culmination of all the bird's early life experiences and the development of essential survival skills."},{"instruction":"Select your answer from the options.

Step 3: Compare both sentences - Both sentences convey the idea that Moses learns his true origins. - In Sentence 1, he does so upon bumping into his sister and brother, while in Sentence 2, he does so upon meeting his brother and sister. Step 4: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first - Both sentences provide the same information about Moses learning his true origins, and the circumstance under which it happens (meeting/bumping into his siblings). Conclusion: Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence because it provides the same core information about Moses learning his true origins upon encountering his siblings."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following movie reviews: 1.

Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The transition between the end of the Eocene and the beginning of the Oligocene is marked by large-scale extinction and floral and faunal turnover (although minor in comparison to the largest mass extinctions). Most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature. They included the last of the ancient cetaceans, the Archaeoceti. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - Megadontosuchus is a genus of tomistomine crocodylian from the middle Eocene of Italy . Fossils have been found from Monte Duello in the province of Verona . The genus is currently monotypic , with the type and only species being M. arduini . The species was originally named in 1880 , although it was assigned to the genus Crocodilius ( now spelled Crocodylus ) . The genus was first erected by paleontologist Charles C. Mook in 1955 along with the tomistomine genus Kentisuchus , which was also first classified as Crocodilius . No holotype for Megadontosuchus was designated in 1880 , and a lectotype was n't proposed until 2007 . Megadontosuchus differs from other tomistomines in that it has a more robust rostrum , very large teeth ( hence the generic name meaning big - toothed crocodile ) , and large supratemporal fenestrae on the skull table . - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain. - Crocodylus is one of three genera from the subfamily Crocodylinae of the family Crocodylidae. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Kentisuchus is an extinct genus of tomistomine crocodylian. It is considered one of the most basal members of the subfamily. Fossils have been found from England and France that date back to the early Eocene. The genus has also been recorded from Ukraine, but it unclear whether specimens from Ukraine are referable to \\"Kentisuchus\\". - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011. - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world. - The Crocodylidae family of crocodylians includes the true crocodiles which are the members of the subfamily Crocodylinae and the \\"Tomistoma\\" genus. Currently, the family includes two subfamilies, Crocodylinae and Tomistominae, with the latter being a subject of controversy whether it is a crocodile or belongs to the family Gavialidae. Further genetic analysis has to be done to come to a final conclusion. - A holotype is a single physical example (or illustration) of an organism, known to have been used when the species (or lower-ranked taxon) was formally described. It is either the single such physical example (or illustration) or one of several such, but explicitly designated as the holotype. Under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), a holotype is one of several kinds of name-bearing types. In the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and ICZN the definitions of types are similar in intent but not identical in terminology or underlying concept. What object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'megadontosuchus'?

The polluted land,which is mostly in economically developed areas,accounts for one-tenth of the country's total arable land,according to an incomplete survey by the State Environmental Protection Administration,China's top environment watchdog. Pollution on cultivated land threatens the environment,food safety and the sustainable development of agriculture,the administration said. Because of continual,too much use of chemical fertilizer, pesticide and agricultural plastic sheeting, as well as irrigation using polluted water, a large amount of contaminants remain in the cultivated land. The contaminants affect the soil's ecological structure and function,leading to decreased soil productivity, lower crop yield ,and lower quality of agricultural products- It also leads to worse water quality in rural areas. Less than 9 per cent of drinkable water passed checks for bacteria in243 rural water supply stations across the county. Another survey, which took samples of drinking water and groundwater an 69 small towns. in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province of North,China, showed that more than half of the water contains too much nitrate ,which may cause diabetes and damage the kidney.

They follow the same path but Mike rides his bike twice as fast as Sue. After ten minutes, who will have covered less distance? (A) Mike (B) Sue. What is the most sensical answer between \\"Mike\\" and \\"Sue\\"? Answer:","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"Mike\\" and \\"Sue\\" is (B) Sue. To better understand this, let's elaborate on the situation and analyze the details: Mike and Sue decide to go for a bike ride around the park. They follow the same path, but Mike rides his bike at twice the speed that Sue does. This means that for any given duration of time, Mike will cover twice as much distance as Sue. Let's use a hypothetical example for better visualization: Suppose Sue is riding her bike at a speed of 5 mph (miles per hour), this means that Mike is riding his bike at a speed of 10 mph, as he is riding twice as fast as Sue. Now, the short story states that they ride their bikes for a total of 10 minutes. To find the distance each of them covered during these 10 minutes, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed × Time Since we know their speeds (5 mph for Sue and 10 mph for Mike) and the time (10 minutes), we can calculate the distance covered by each rider. First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours, because the speeds are given in miles per hour. 10 minutes = 10/60 hours = 1/6 hour Now, we will calculate the distance covered by each rider: 1. Sue's distance = (Sue's speed) × (Time) = (5 mph) × (1/6 hour) = 5/6 miles 2. Mike's distance = (Mike's speed) × (Time) = (10 mph) × (1/6 hour) = 10/6 miles = 5/3 miles Comparing both distances, we can see that Sue has covered 5/6 miles, while Mike has covered 5/3 miles. Since 5/6 miles is less than 5/3 miles, Sue has covered less distance during the ten-minute bike ride around the park. Hence, the most sensical answer is (B) Sue."},{"instruction":"1.

I remember the occasion when Mother sent me to the main road, about twenty yards away from the farmhouse, to invite a passing group of seasonal work-seekers home for a meal. She instructed me to take a container along and collect dry cow dung for making a fire. I was then to prepare the meal for the group of work-seekers. The thought of making an open fire outside at midday, cooking in a large three-legged pot in that high heat, was enough to upset even an angel. I did not manage to hide my feelings from my mother, and after serving the group, she called me to the balcony, where she usually sat to attend to her sewing .

Plot title: Tobruk Movie plot: In September 1942, Rommel's Africa Korps is only 90 miles (144Â km) from the Suez Canal, but running dangerously low on fuel. The British approve a plan to destroy German fuel bunkers at Tobruk in an attempt to cripple Rommel's attack. The author of the plan, Canadian born Major Donald Craig (Rock Hudson) had been captured by Vichy French forces. As his expertise is considered essential to the success of the raid, Craig is rescued by Captain Kurt Bergman (George Peppard) of the Special Identification Group (SIG) and some of his men, German Jews serving with the British. They then join up with commandos of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG), under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Harker (Nigel Green), at Kufra in south-eastern Libya. Colonel Harker explains they have eight days to get to Tobruk and destroy the fuel depot and German field guns protecting the harbour, before a scheduled amphibious landing and a bombing raid on the city by the RAF. They are to drive there through enemy territory posing as POWs escorted by the SIG pretending to be guards. Once they reach Tobruk they would then link up with a full Naval and RAF assault on the city and their primary objective, Rommel's underground fuel bunkers. Craig is highly skeptical of the operation, claiming that \\"Staff has a genius for sitting on its brains and coming up with perfect hindsight\\", stating that when he originally submitted the plan they could have blown up the fuel bunkers with only a handful of men before questioning how they were supposed to get through well established German defences now. While warning Craig not to let personal differences of opinion interfere with the operation, Colonel Harker also reveals that he was the genius with perfect hindsight who convinced Staff to approve Craig's original plan which would now be \\"maximum effort, land, sea and air\\".

Of the students that play a brass instrument, a fifth of them play the saxophone. Of the students that play the saxophone, a third of them play the alto saxophone. How many students play the alto saxophone?","output":"Step 1: Determine the number of students in the marching band. To find the number of students in the marching band, we can multiply the total number of students in the senior class by the fraction that represents the marching band. 600 students * (1/5) = 120 students in the marching band. Step 2: Find the number of students that play a brass instrument. To find the number of students that play a brass instrument, we can multiply the number of students in the marching band by the fraction that represents the brass instrument players. 120 students in the marching band * (1/2) = 60 students play a brass instrument. Step 3: Determine the number of students that play the saxophone. To find out the number of students that play the saxophone, we can multiply the number of students that play a brass instrument by the fraction that represents the saxophone players. 60 students play a brass instrument * (1/5) = 12 students play the saxophone. Step 4: Find the number of students that play the alto saxophone. To find the number of students that play the alto saxophone, we can multiply the number of students that play the saxophone by the fraction that represents the alto saxophone players. 12 students play the saxophone * (1/3) = 4 students play the alto saxophone.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When pondering the concept of time travel and altering past events, one might instinctively look to popular science fiction movies and books for answers. However, it is crucial to look at the scientific and philosophical aspects of this inquiry. According to the general theory of relativity developed by Einstein, time is intertwined with space, forming a continuum known as spacetime. The concept of time travel does seem theoretically possible by exploiting the spacetime curvature, for instance, by using a phenomenon called closed timelike curves. However, establishing such loops remains a challenging task and has not yet been achieved. More importantly, the idea of changing past events raises concerns about the potential paradoxes that might emerge. The most famous among these is the 'grandfather paradox', wherein a time traveler goes back in time and prevents their own grandfather from meeting their grandmother. Consequently, the time traveler would cease to exist, which then begs the questions: How could they have gone back in time in the first place? And who was responsible for preventing the grandfather from meeting the grandmother? Several theories have been proposed to address such paradoxes, including the 'many-worlds' interpretation, which postulates that multiple parallel universes exist, and new ones are created with every decision made. In this case, if a time traveler went back in time and affected past events, they would merely shift to another timeline existing in a parallel universe. Thus, the past in their original timeline remains unchanged, thereby eliminating the paradox. Despite these theories, the scientific consensus is that time travel into the past is not feasible with our current understanding of the universe. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"Is it possible to travel back in time and change the past?\\" is no."},{"instruction":"A strong supporter of the \\"Italian road to socialism\\", he was close to Enrico Berlinguer, and gained a position in the party secretariat.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Natta supported Italian Socialism.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Alessandro Natta, a key figure in Italian politics, supported Italian Socialism based on the information provided. As a strong supporter of the \\"Italian road to socialism,\\" Natta's political ideology and actions aligned with the core principles and objectives of socialism in the context of Italy during the 20th century. As a close ally of Enrico Berlinguer, who was the Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) from 1972 to 1984, and an influential figure in shaping the direction of socialism in Italy, Natta played a significant role within the party and its secretariat. Some of his key actions, such as his 1969 report that led to the expulsion of the Manifesto group (a radical faction within the PCI) and his subsequent election as party secretary following Berlinguer's death in 1984, further solidified his commitment to Italian Socialism. The \\"Italian road to socialism\\" aimed to achieve a socialist society in Italy, adapted to the country's unique political, cultural, and social context. This involved the development of socialist ideas and policies that focused on social reform, wealth redistribution, social justice, and workers' rights in a manner specifically tailored to the Italian context.

The Horn of Africa denotes the region containing the countries of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. - Zokors are Asiatic burrowing rodents resembling mole-rats. They include two genera, \\"Myospalax\\" and \\"Eospalax\\". Zokors are native to much of China, Kazakhstan, and Siberian Russia. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - The Muridae, or murids, are the largest family of rodents and of mammals, containing over 700 species found naturally throughout Eurasia, Africa, and Australia. - The Muroidea are a large superfamily of rodents, including mice, rats, voles, hamsters, gerbils, and many other relatives. They occupy a vast variety of habitats on every continent except Antarctica. Some authorities have placed all members of this group into a single family, Muridae, due to difficulties in determining how the subfamilies are related to one another. The following taxonomy is based on recent well-supported molecular phylogenies. - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\".

Fulfilling our desire to watch a couple get engaged on television after only weeks of knowing each other? Yes. Shocking? Not at all. Predictable? Very much so. If you haven't seen Monday's finale, stop reading now to avoid spoilers. was left with two men: . The episode started with a dramatic introduction of JoJo and her predicament. She strolled up and down the beaches of Thailand to explain that when she's with Robby, she thinks of Jordan, and vice versa – all over the course of approximately 12 outfit changes. Then it was time for JoJo to meet up with her family, and everyone watching silently rejoiced because JoJo's mom, Soraya, was finally back on TV. We'd been dreaming of this day ever since she \\"I think I love both of them. I haven't told either one of them that yet – neither of them know how I feel.\\" JoJo's mom knows what's up. The first guy to meet JoJo's family was Jordan, who was introduced to the legendary Soraya, dad Joseph, JoJo's two brothers and her sister. This whole meeting started off kind of how you might imagine it would be if you engineered a guy in a lab to create the ideal specimen to bring home to Mom and Dad. Jordan even brought everyone in the family a \\"silly hat\\" because one of his family traditions is to \\"embarrass each other\\" and then they all tried on the hats and had a grand old time. Things got serious, however, when Soraya took Jordan aside. It was rather difficult to understand what she was trying to say most of the time but she basically made it clear she felt Jordan might be a playboy. \\"You're an attention-catcher. You catch a lot of attention of a female.\\" Jordan, for his part, held his own as best as he could – even when Soraya put him on the spot and commanded him to give his word that he would never break JoJo's heart. Soraya is kind of like Cersei from but really foreign, and it's fantastic. Jordan sat down with JoJo's dad, Joseph. The two had a fairly decent chat – except Jordan made the huge mistake of not explicitly asking for Joseph's blessing and his daughter's hand in marriage. (A formality we learn JoJo made extremely clear was very important to her.) Right off the bat it was obvious that JoJo's entire family was vibing on Robby – perhaps more than they were with Jordan. Robby had definitely been rehearsing for this meeting his entire life and pulled out all the stops. When confronted by Soraya with the same tough questions she had for Jordan, Robby went above and beyond to make it clear he was 100 percent ready to propose. There's just no way he didn't have that speech prepared for weeks. Meanwhile Soraya kept talking about princesses and queens and how she wanted Robby to make JoJo a \\"queen of his heart.\\" The Cersei comparison never felt more appropriate. Then Robby took Soraya and Joseph aside and formally asked them for JoJo's hand in marriage by making Even though most of America shudders when Robby calls JoJo \\"Joelle,\\" JoJo's parents were completely transfixed – to the point where they both actually cried. Robby, take a bow. Anyway, then Robby left and JoJo was left alone with her family to discuss the two men, at which point they all basically admitted they were totally #TeamRobby. JoJo was very distraught by this information – and when she found out that Jordan asked for her parents' blessing, she was shocked. She eventually called them out for being so pro-Robby, at which point they all tried to backtrack, but it was still really obvious how they felt and JoJo cried a lot. For their last day together before the final rose ceremony, JoJo and Robby went to the beach. JoJo and Robby made out on the beach, JoJo and Robby made out in the ocean, JoJo and Robby made out underwater – you get the picture. Then they talked about what their future together would look like, and Robby launched into a creepy-detailed fantasy story, something about how they were in the living room with their dog and accidentally burned their meat loaf and the kids were upstairs etc. You lost us at \\"meat loaf,\\" Robby. For the evening portion of their date, JoJo came over to Robby's hotel room and Robby went on about how much he loved her, which appears to be their main topic of conversation. Robby even brought out a bunch of pictures of the two of them and JoJo loved every second of this very public display of adoration. The man knows what he's doing, we'll give him that. Next, JoJo spent the day with Jordan on a boat. They went kayaking through some grottos and then settled down on a beautiful, tucked away little beach because Jordan always gets the best dates. Of course, JoJo was still reeling over the fact that Jordan hadn't asked for her parents' blessing – so she called him out about it and demanded to know why. Jordan basically didn't have an answer for her and after some fumbling over his words – and constant interruptions from a clearly irritated JoJo, he said it had to do with the fact he wasn't sure if JoJo was going to pick him in the end. \\"I don't know if it's me,\\" he told her. \\"There are two of us left.\\" JoJo wasn't having any of this and the more upset she got, the more flustered Jordan became – like, he saying the wrong things, forcing JoJo to wonder whether he was actually ready to commit. The conversation carried on into the evening portion of their date, where JoJo jumped right back into the fact that she just couldn't believe Jordan messed this one up so royally by not asking for her parents' blessing. Jordan said a few more of the wrong things (like using the word \\"if\\" when referring to himself getting down on one knee), but he seemed to manage to semi-reassure her that he was committed, 100 percent, and didn't want to lose her. \\"I know you love me.\\" The next day it was finally time for JoJo to make her decision – but first, each man had to pick out a Robby went first and said a whole bunch of nauseating things (i.e. \\"My heart is exploding with love out of my chest\\") and then he wrote her a long love letter because Robby just really wants to be Noah Calhoun from Jordan also picked out a ring – but more importantly, he needed to do damage control for his major screw-up and call JoJo's parents. Soraya and Joseph both gave them their blessing to propose to JoJo, and Jordan wrote JoJo a note to let her know that he wasn't a complete lost cause. As she was getting ready, JoJo received the guys' letters and she basically just lost it. Like, she could not stop crying. \\"I don't feel right. I don't like that,\\" she said between sobs after reading Jordan's letter. \\"It's like, everything I want. I needed to hear this. I needed to know that my family was able to give their blessing. I believe in him.\\" Then she read Robby's note and started crying all over again. \\"These are the things I want to hear before I get engaged to someone,\\" she said. \\"This is the kind of love that I want to have. I can't keep going back and forth. I can't keep doing this to myself. I feel like I'm like, having a panic attack.\\" Finally, the moment we'd all been waiting for arrived: JoJo stood on a gorgeous beach, waiting for her runner-up to arrive so she could break up with him â¦ and out came Robby. \\"This is crazy, it's a good crazy,\\" Robby said, taking her hands. \\"It's the kind of crazy that kept me searching for this forever love that I found in you. â¦ My heart yearns for you, and I undoubtedly and wholeheartedly am in love with you. It's a love that you only hear about in fairy tales and stories. I want to be with you forever. I will love you forever. â¦ I promise to love you 'til the day I die.\\" At this point, JoJo started tearing up and interrupted him. \\"I can't let you get down on one knee,\\" she said. \\"I can't let you do that because I don't want to take that moment from you.\\" \\"What is it?\\" Robby asked. (HOW HAVE YOU NOT CAUGHT ON YET, ROBBY?) \\"Robby, I woke up this morning wanting it to be you,\\" JoJo said. \\"Every day I've been wanting it to be you. I fell in love with you, but for some reason my heart is somewhere else. You have made me feel the type of love that I've always dreamt of feeling. The type of love that I honestly didn't believe existed.\\" \\"I don't know. It's not the love, that's the thing,\\" JoJo replied. \\"I know that you will love me until the day that you die, and you deserve the type of love that you have given me. Robby, I didn't want this. You don't get how badly I wanted it to be you.\\" As for Robby's reaction? For someone who had been telling JoJo how in love with her he was for the last 4 weeks, he seemed weirdly pretty chill with all of this. \\"All I want is for you to be happy,\\" he said. \\"Hopefully in the end you are.\\" She walked him back to the car and it was so awkward. Why were they still holding hands? JoJo could not stop crying. Robby basically didn't shed a single tear, but he kept wiping his face with a handkerchief. It's probably humid in Thailand. Then Robby got in the car and gave his runner-up exit interview – only problem was he mumbled the whole thing into his damn handkerchief and we have no idea what he was saying. After saying goodbye to Robby, JoJo said the only thing getting her through it was the thought of seeing Jordan. He walked up to meet her on the beach – at the exact same spot she had dumped Robby just moments before – and the two embraced. \\"I love you so much,\\" Jordan started. \\"I fell in love first with just us, the person I could be right away with you. How comfortable, and confident, and how you challenged me, continued to challenge me to be the best version of myself and I love that. You made me believe that love doesn't need to have scripts, there's not one way to draw it up. There are moments like this where I'm holding your hands and I'm looking in your eyes and I know.\\" \\"I'm so unbelievably in love with you,\\" he continued. \\"You're my best friend. You're my soul mate. I'm going to keep you safe. I'm going to protect you. I'm going to wake up every morning and choose you over and over and over again 'til you tell me I can't.\\" At this point JoJo interrupted him – but only to finally say those three little words back for the very first time. \\"Jordan, I love you so much,\\" she said. \\"I've been waiting to tell you that I love you. I love you so much. I didn't want you to get down on one knee until I told you that.\\" JoJo Fletcher and Jordan Rodgers on the cover of PEOPLE Then, finally, it happened: \\"I love you so much. I want to spend the rest of my life with you,\\" Jordan said, getting down on one knee. \\"Joelle Hannah Fletcher, will you marry me?\\" JoJo said yes, and he placed the ring on finger, both of their hands shaking with emotion. \\"This is the best day of my life,\\" JoJo told the cameras. \\"Our life,\\" Jordan added. \\"It's us now.

As he walks towards the source of the sound, the next subway car, he slips and falls in a large pool of blood. He then peers through the window to the next car and sees a figure chopping up a bloody corpse. Leon (Bradley Cooper) is a vegan amateur photographer who wants to find unique spots of the L.A. cityscape to shoot and, at the advice of his contractor Susan (Brooke Shields), heads into the city's subway system at night. He is criticized constantly by other photographers for fleeing danger before shooting a full reel. One night, in a decision to break this trend, he saves a woman from a gang that is abusing her. The next day, he discovers this girl has gone missing. Leon is intrigued by the mystery, and begins to investigate newsreels about similar disappearances. His investigation leads him to a butcher named Mahogany (Vinnie Jones), whom he suspects has been killing subway passengers for the past three years. Leon attempts to turn some of the photos he has taken of Mahogany in to the police, but they refuse to believe him and, instead, cast suspicion on his own motives in photographing the victims. Leon's involvement quickly turns into a dark obsession, upsetting his waitress girlfriend Maya (Leslie Bibb), who is as disbelieving of his story as the police chief. Leon takes matters into his own hands, entering the subway train at midnight, only to witness a shocking bloodbath, as the butcher kills several passengers, then hangs them on meat hooks. Passing out on the subway floor, he awakes the next morning in a slaughterhouse with strange markings carved into his chest.

Joe Barton (R-TX) has been mostly lampooned for apologizing to BP for the White House’s alleged “shakedown” of the company to create a 20 billion escrow fund, some conservatives have been willing to defend the congressman. Today, Kentucky Republican Senate nominee Rand Paul — the tea party darling who has himself faced criticism for defending BP — offered his sympathies to Barton, saying he knows “what it is like to be piled on.” While Paul stopped short of endorsing Barton’s point of view, he suggested that the criticism of Barton was “over the top,” and said that Barton “should be given the chance to explain himself”: “I don’t know about that,” Paul said, when asked about Barton’s statement during an appearance on WVLK-AM radio on Friday. “I don’t want to pile on him. … I know what that feels like. What I will say is I have never liked the tone of the president when he said things or his administration says things like he is going to put the boot on the throat of BP.” [...] “I’m not really in a position to know about what they should do to [Barton] personally. I do know what it is like to be piled on,” he said. “I do know that people sometimes can go over the top and I think he should be given the chance to explain himself.“ Paul joins a host of conservative pundits who have come to Barton’s defense, praising his “courage” and “legitimate point[s].” Meanwhile, the right-wing media’s fearless leader, radio host Rush Limbaugh, threw his weight behind Barton yesterday as well. As the Washington Post’s Dave Weigel noted, “Discussing Barton’s comments, Limbaugh repeatedly called the fund a ’shakedown,’ [and] worried that it was a plot by Obama to ‘redistribute that money to ACORN.’” Limbaugh said the “shakedown” showed the Obama “regime” was behaving like “a branch of organized crime”: LIMBAUGH: Joe Barton apologized to BP executives on behalf of himself, the American people, for the shakedown. … The United States government may as well be a branch of organized crime the way that it is being conducted and the way it’s doing business, and the way it’s looking out for itself and no one else. … Organized crime. It’s the closest thing I can think to analogize what’s happening here. And even these guys that are being shaken down, they’re paying protection money, and it isn’t enough. It isn’t enough. Though Barton eventually apologized for his apology, Paul and a large swath of the right’s punditry appear set on defending Barton’s outrageous position. Responding to callers who challenged him for “defending BP,” Limbaugh explained that he was “trying to defend the US Constitution, the American way of life, American exceptionalism, [and] what it was that made this country great.” Many Gulf residents would likely disagree that apologizing to the company that ruined their economy and ecology made this country great. ||||| Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) is under fire from the White House and the Beltway media for his statement to BP today: “I’m only speaking for myself. I’m not speaking for anyone else, but I apologize. I do not want to live in a county where anytime a citizen or a corporation does something that is legitimately wrong, [it is] subject to some sort of political pressure that, again, in my words, amounts to a shakedown.” Barton should have been apologizing to the American people, not BP, but other than that he is 100% correct. What happened in the White House yesterday was a “shakedown” of Godfather-like proportions. Lets review: 1) BP agreed to pay 20 billion over four years to an “independent” party; 2) BP immediately identified 20 billion in U.S. assets that could be liquidated should BP not be able to pay on time; 3) BP received no assurances that the ultimate economic damages would not be higher; 4) BP is still liable for all individual and state claims in court; 5) The fund is completely separate from any environmental damages, which the Obama administration says could top 30 billion; 6) BP paid another 100 million for workers made unemployed by President Obama’s indefinite ban on offshore oil drilling; 7) BP received no assurance that the White House would not ask for more money if the ban becomes permanent. All of this was “negotiated” while Attorney General Eric Holder, who has already threatened BP with criminal prosecution, stood in the corner. And what did BP get in return? A single statement from the President saying he did not want to drive BP into bankruptcy. Of course he doesn’t. The mob can’t collect from a bankrupt business. Clinton administration Deputy Attorney General turned BP lawyer Jamie Gorelick let slip what the game is really all about: “We know what it looks like when a company is driven into bankruptcy. The claims that come first are the creditors, then the employees, then the environmental claims, and then the likes of shrimpers. This would not be a good result for anyone.” Well, not anyone who expects the law to be followed. Yesterday’s White House victim was not BP. It was the rule of law. Just as the Obama administration junked the bankruptcy code last year to protect their union allies, they are doing the exact same thing this time for their environmental ones. |||||","output":"Republican Congressman Joe Barton faced backlash for apologizing to BP in response to the White House's alleged \\"shakedown\\" of the company, which had established a 20 billion escrow fund. Despite the criticism, some conservatives have defended Barton, emphasizing the importance of understanding the situation better before engaging in criticism. Kentucky Republican Senate nominee Rand Paul expressed his sympathy for Barton and called for public restraint on judgment. Similarly, radio host Rush Limbaugh supported Barton by criticizing President Obama's administration for behaving like a branch of organized crime and intensifying pressure on BP.

Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet (French: [ʒyl emil fʁedeʁik masnɛ]; 12 May 1842 – 13 August 1912) was a French composer of the Romantic era best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty. The two most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892). He also composed oratorios, ballets, orchestral works, incidental music, piano pieces, songs and other music. While still a schoolboy, Massenet was admitted to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became best known for his operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Like many prominent French composers of the period, Massenet became a professor at the Conservatoire. He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas. Among his students were Gustave Charpentier, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn and Gabriel Pierné. By the time of his death, Massenet was regarded by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted...

So how can we know what food is healthy? Unluckily, a lot of food that looks good may have pollution. Where is the pollution from? It has something to do with how people produce food: growing it on the farm, processing it in factories, and making it ready for you to eat. Here's what happens: Most farmers use chemicals to stop their crops from getting sick. Many of these chemicals remain in the food that you eat. Some people believe this may cause cancer. These chemicals may also pollute water and air, and kill animals and even people by accident. Most drinks are just flavored water . Every drink coming in plastic bottles which you then throw away means a waste. Sugary drinks make you fat. In the factories, much of what you eat and drink gets messed. Often things are put into food to make it delicious and look good but they might be harmful to people. And some food like meat often gets polluted by bacteria.

Options: - ungulate - bomber - body armor - tank - hat Let's think step by step:","output":"1. Ungulate: An ungulate is a type of mammal with hooves, such as a deer or a horse. Wearing an ungulate would not provide any protection from a cannon, so this option can be eliminated. 2. Bomber: A bomber refers to a military aircraft designed to drop bombs. Wearing a bomber is not applicable in this case, and it does not provide any protection against a cannon. Therefore, this option can be eliminated. 3. Body armor: Body armor provides some level of protection against projectiles, but traditional body armor used by soldiers or law enforcement officers is not designed to withstand the force of a cannonball or the shrapnel from an exploding shell. While it may offer limited protection, it would not be the most effective choice. 4. Tank: A tank is a heavily armored military vehicle designed for front-line combat, with strong protection against enemy fire, including cannons.

However, I can attempt to hypothesize on possible reasons based on provided information. 1. First, I would look into whether there's any pattern to the occurrence? Is this happening only on specific apps like Foxtel and Plex, or is it being experienced on all platforms? 2. If it's specific to certain apps, the problem could stem from those apps themselves. They might have implemented a new advertising policy that isn't working as intended, or there could be a bug or fault with how the TV and app interact, causing ads to play incorrectly. 3. If it's happening across all platforms, it could be a broader software issue with the Samsung Smart TVs. The software responsible for displaying ads could be malfunctioning and triggering the display of ads at inappropriate times. 4. Considering Samsung's reaction - that they're making it their 'top priority' to investigate, it's feasible to consider that this might be due to a software update that didn't go as planned or introduced unexpected bugs. 5. It could also be a problem with third-party ad networks. If Samsung's smart TVs are using ad networks to display ads, there could be a problem at the server-side causing ads to play when they should not.

What does a dead body smell like after it's started to decompose? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Decomposition: How long does it take for a dead body to start smelling? Decomposition is a complex process that varies depending on several factors, including the environment, temperature, humidity, and the presence of insects, bacteria, and other organisms. It's essential to understand that the timeline for decomposition is not constant, and it may vary significantly from case to case. However, one can provide a general overview and estimate when discussing when a dead body might start smelling. In ideal conditions, a dead body will start decomposing relatively quickly after the time of death. As the body stops circulating blood and bacteria starts breaking down the tissues, producing various chemicals and gases as byproducts, such as putrescine, cadaverine, and indole, which contribute to the characteristic smell of a decomposing body. Internal organs usually start breaking down after 24-48 hours, producing a foul odor as they begin to decay. The process accelerates after the first three days, particularly if the body is exposed to a warm and humid environment. This is when the first signs of external decomposition begin to appear, and the smell becomes much more noticeable. This timeframe may be prolonged in colder environments, as the decomposition process is much slower in cooler temperatures. Additionally, a body is more likely to start smelling when left exposed to air, compared to one that's been wrapped or covered. What does a dead body smell like after it's started to decompose? A decomposing dead body emits a strong, unpleasant odor that is often described as a mix of rotting meat, feces, and a pungent, sweet-moldy smell. This distinctive and unbearable smell is due to the action of bacteria and the release of various decomposing byproducts. The primary chemicals responsible for the odor are cadaverine, putrescine, and skatole, which are the result of amino acid degradation. As decomposition progresses, more chemicals and gases like hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methane, and volatile organic compounds may contribute to the smell. It is important to understand that the entire decomposition process is dynamic, meaning that the specific smell may change over time as the body goes through different phases of decay. Do those questions have the same meaning? No, those two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question asks how long it takes for a dead body to start smelling, focusing on the timeframe of when the decomposition process will produce an odor. The second question, however, is describing what a dead body smells like after it has started decomposing, focusing on the characteristics and description of the smell itself. While both questions are related to the decomposition process and the resulting odor, they address different aspects of the topic and seek different types of information."},{"instruction":"Within the city of Detroit, there are over a dozen major hospitals which include the Detroit Medical Center (DMC), Henry Ford Health System, St. John Health System, and the John D.

Streets in Belgrade, the capital, have all reverted to their original pre–World War II and pre-communist names as well. In 2004, Antun Augustinčić's statue of Broz in his birthplace of Kumrovec was decapitated in an explosion. It was subsequently repaired. Twice in 2008, protests took place in Zagreb's Marshal Tito Square, organized by a group called Circle for the Square (Krug za Trg), with an aim to force the city government to rename it to its previous name, while a counter-protest by Citizens' Initiative Against Ustašism (Građanska inicijativa protiv ustaštva) accused the \\"Circle for the Square\\" of historical revisionism and neo-fascism.

Let it dry between coats. Wipe it off.\\"","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Revamping Your Couch with a Fresh Coat of Paint Introduction There comes a time when homeowners and renters alike realize that their couch may no longer be a fashion statement or a reflection of their ideal living space. Instead of immediately replacing the furniture, a more affordable and creative solution is to breathe new life into it by giving it a fresh coat of paint. In this article, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process of painting your couch, ensuring a vibrant transformation that will surely complement your home décor. Step 1: Prepare the couch Before applying any paint, it is essential to adequately prepare the couch to ensure that the paint adheres well and that the end result is seamless. Begin by clearing away dust, dirt, and debris with a vacuum or a soft brush. Remove any cushions or additional parts that can be detached, and cover any hardware or non-fabric portions with painter's tape to prevent accidental painting. If your couch has upholstery, it's recommended to use a fabric medium mixed with acrylic paint to achieve the desired color and consistent finish. However, if your couch has a leather or vinyl surface, a specially-formulated leather paint is best. Step 2: Apply the paint Whether using a brush or a paint sprayer, it's crucial to apply the paint in thin, even coats. Start by applying a thin coat of paint to the fabric or leather, working your way from the top down to the bottom. Be sure to apply the paint evenly and cover all areas of the couch, following any seams or lines in the fabric. For cushions and other detachables, paint them separately to ensure comprehensive coverage. If using fabric medium and acrylic paint, mix them according to the manufacturer's instructions before applying it to your couch. It usually requires a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a more flexible and longer-lasting finish. Step 3: Let it dry between coats It's essential to allow each coat of paint to dry completely before applying additional layers. This will not only allow the paint to adhere properly but will also prevent it from clumping or wrinkling. Depending on factors like the type of paint used, the thickness of each coat, and the room's temperature and humidity, drying times may vary between a few hours to overnight. Always consult the paint manufacturer's guidelines for recommended drying times. Step 4: Wipe off excess paint Once your paint has dried, it is a good idea to wipe off any excess paint to reveal a clean, finished look. Use a damp cloth or a non-abrasive sponge to gently remove any paint splatters or buildup that may have occurred during the application process. Ensure that you don't use harsh chemicals or excessive pressure when wiping the couch, as this may damage the paint or the fabric beneath. Step 5: Final touches After the paint has dried and the excess removed, reassemble your couch by attaching the cushions and other detachable parts. Carefully remove the painter's tape from the hardware and non-fabric areas. For added protection and longevity, consider sealing the paint job with a clear sealant specifically designed for the type of paint used. Conclusion With the right preparation, materials, and execution, painting your couch can be a successful and rewarding DIY project. By following these steps, you'll transform your couch into a stunning centerpiece that complements your living space, bringing both visual appeal and renewed comfort. So, before considering a replacement, choose to revamp your couch, and showcase your creativity in a unique and cost-effective manner."},{"instruction":"Q: I heard that Tracy got changed by the event in her life.

It is crucial to understand that language proficiency is shaped by various factors, and it might not be easy to pinpoint the exact cause in this particular situation. However, the following possibilities might help provide some insights into the matter: 1. Lack of exposure to English: One of the main reasons people struggle with learning a new language is insufficient exposure. If this person lived in an Arabic-speaking country or community and primarily interacted with Arabic-speaking friends and family, he may not have had many opportunities to practice English. 2. Inadequate education or training: It is possible that he did not receive quality English education in his formal schooling, or he might have missed out on important lessons. Poor teaching methods and lack of resources can also contribute to weak language skills. 3. Limited motivation or interest: Many people learn languages more effectively when driven by personal motivation, such as career enhancement, travel plans, or appreciation for the language's culture, which can positively affect their progress. In this case, it could be that the person doesn't have a strong personal interest in learning English, which affects his language proficiency. 4. Fear of making mistakes: It is not uncommon for language learners to feel apprehensive about using the language they are learning for fear of making mistakes or being misunderstood. They may choose to communicate only with people who speak their native language, which can further hinder their progress in the language they are learning. 5. Learning disabilities or challenges: Some individuals may face cognitive or learning difficulties, which might present additional challenges when it comes to acquiring language skills. For example, dyslexia can make it harder to read and understand texts, affecting language acquisition. 6. Inefficient learning strategies or techniques: An individual's choice of learning methods can significantly influence their language proficiency. If a person relies solely on passive learning strategies, such as only reading textbooks or listening to audio recordings, he may not develop the practical skills necessary for conversing in that language. In conclusion, various factors can contribute to a person's poor English skills, ranging from limited exposure and inadequate education to personal motivation and inherent learning challenges. It might be difficult to identify the specific cause without additional context on the individual's life experiences and background, but these general factors could be some of the possible reasons."},{"instruction":"The Cardinals hosted a close contest with the Kansas City Chiefs. The game was the first at the newly christened University of Phoenix Stadium, which signed its naming rights deal with the Cardinals two days after Arizona's last home game vs. St. Louis. The Cards started off hot as Matt Leinart, making his first NFL start, threw two touchdowns in the first quarter to his two top targets, Anquan Boldin and Larry Fitzgerald. The Chiefs responded early in the second quarter with a 45-yard field goal by kicker Lawrence Tynes, and a touchdown pass from quarterback Damon Huard to running back Larry Johnson. Cards kicker Neil Rackers added a 41-yard field at the end of the first half. Another Rackers field goal, this time from 45 yards, accounted for the only score in the third quarter.

Additionally, Ava uses the descriptor \\"SEXY @**\\" within quotes as if to imply that others have referred to her using that term, which could indicate that she might be receiving unwanted attention or objectification. Her decision to include this term in quotes also showcases a dissociation from the label, further supporting the negative sentiment. It is important to note that sentiments can be context-specific and subjective, therefore others might interpret this tweet differently. However, based on the aforementioned factors and choosing between the options of negative and positive, it can be concluded that the sentiment expressed in this tweet is primarily negative."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @erolalkan We got thrown out of pub. Say goodbye to Richard for me. And his Bubblegum Army. Possible answers: (A). negative (B). positive","output":"Based on the context provided in the tweet and the available options, we can analyze this tweet's sentiment as follows: Characteristics that may lead to a negative sentiment: 1. The mention of getting \\"thrown out of pub\\" implies an undesirable and possibly embarrassing experience, which could be viewed as a negative event. 2. The individual is unable to say goodbye to Richard directly; instead, they must send a message via social media. This can indicate that they may have been removed from their friend's company abruptly, which could lead to feelings of disappointment or sadness. 3. The mention of the \\"Bubblegum Army\\" could be interpreted as a sarcastic or mocking remark about the group of friends, depending on the relationship between the individuals involved. Characteristics that may lead to a positive sentiment: 1. The tweet's tone could be interpreted as light-hearted or humorous since it is being shared on social media. The use of \\"thrown out\\" and the reference to the \\"Bubblegum Army\\" could be seen as playful, suggesting that the individual is not taking the situation too seriously and chooses to make light of it. 2. Asking the recipient to say goodbye to Richard and his group of friends may indicate that there is a certain level of camaraderie and bonding within this group. Considering the different aspects of this tweet, it appears that the negative elements (being thrown out of the pub and the inability to say goodbye directly) outweigh the positive aspects (potentially light-hearted tone). Therefore, I would select option (A) negative as the sentiment of this tweet. This assessment ultimately lends itself to the conclusion that the tweet's overall sentiment leans more towards negativity."},{"instruction":"What a disappointment!

The word \\"super\\" is used as an adjective to express enthusiasm, commendation, or satisfaction, which signifies that the reviewer enjoyed the movie and had a favorable impression of it. Therefore, the correct answer would be option (B). Positive. To further elaborate, when a reviewer uses the term \\"super\\" to describe their experience with a movie, they are likely highlighting the exceptional qualities of the film. These qualities might include top-notch acting, a captivating and enthralling storyline, skillful use of cinematography, or other elements that make a movie memorable and enjoyable for audiences. Additionally, a positive review can also contribute to higher box office revenue, increased word-of-mouth marketing, and better overall reception for a movie. In contrast, a negative review would focus on the shortcomings and flaws present in a film, which would leave the reviewer dissatisfied and disappointed. In conclusion, based on the information given, we can determine that the movie was seen positively by the reviewer as they have used the term \\"super\\" to express their pleasant and favorable experience.

For my friends and simpaticos in the immigration reform community, enough to go ballistic at the mere mention of the phrase: \\"illegal immigrant.\\" First, there's enough to be afraid of in this world -- from big government to monsters under the bed. We shouldn't be afraid of words. And when it comes time to declare a word or phrase offensive, we should be careful to do so judiciously and not go overboard. That's my advice to my very good friend and business partner, Charles Garcia, for whom I have great affection and tremendous respect. He's my brother from another mother. That's true even on the rare occasion when he's wrong. And that's the case this week now that Charlie has written, in a thought-provoking column for CNN.com, that the phrase \\"illegal immigrant\\" is \\"biased\\" and \\"racially offensive.\\" He also implied that it's a \\"slur\\" and -- borrowing language from George Orwell -- a \\"worn-out and useless phrase.\\" Actually, it's none of the above. The phrase is accurate. It's the shoe that fits. It's reality. And, as is often the case with reality, it's hard for some people to accept. What do you think about the term? Share your view with CNN iReport. Apparently, that includes people like Justice Sonia Sotomayor who, in her first opinion on the Supreme Court -- in a 2009 case called Mohawk Industries v. Carpenter, which involved a business accused of employing illegal immigrants -- used the term \\"undocumented immigrant.\\" According to The New York Times, this was the first time that a Supreme Court justice had used that phrase. Other justices had previously gone with \\"illegal immigrant.\\" Undocumented immigrant? Really? That's politically correct, but it's also absurd. Most of these people have plenty of documents. A woman who makes a living cleaning homes in my neighborhood once explained to me that she had a drawer full of fake green cards and IDs saying she was -- pick one -- a native-born U.S. citizen, legal resident or exchange student. Many illegal immigrants have Matricula ID cards issued by Mexican consulates, foreign passports, drivers licenses in some states and phony Social Security cards where all nine digits are \\"0's.\\" Garcia: Why \\"illegal immigrant\\" is a slur. This isn't about documents. It has been my experience that many of those who have trouble with the phrase \\"illegal immigrant\\" are really troubled by something deeper -- the fact that, at the end of the day, by supporting a pathway to earned legal status, they're defending a group of people who engaged in unlawful activity. For some folks, this is messy business. So they try to sanitize it by changing the language. As a columnist, I don't mind messy. I have never used \\"illegal aliens,\\" and I never will. And I don't use \\"illegal\\" as a noun. But, like many other journalists, including those at CNN, I do use \\"illegal immigrant.\\" And I refuse to accept that doing so is tantamount to a hate crime. I don't want to demean anyone. But, as someone who makes his living with words, I'd also prefer not to degrade the English language. Besides, in more than 20 years of writing about illegal immigrants -- oops, there, I said it again -- I've been accused of defending lawbreakers thousands of times. I plead guilty as charged. I don't condone illegal immigration, but I do often defend illegal immigrants who are unfairly exploited, picked on and blamed for everything from crime to pollution to the quality of public schools. As Charlie correctly points out in the part of the column with which I agree, a lot of that nonsense comes from the Republican Party and shameful politicians who think that raising our blood pressure over illegal immigration is a shortcut to helping them raise their poll numbers and raise funds from contributors. I've spanked many of these officials before, and I look forward to the next opportunity. For the record, I'm not against high blood pressure. I've been known to raise it myself. I think that, if people are upset that our immigration system is broken, they have a right to be angry. But I also think they should direct their anger at government and politicians, and not at the immigrants themselves. I also think that illegal immigrants are more of a positive than a negative. They make a contribution to the U.S. economy, do jobs Americans won't do, replenish the American spirit with hope and optimism and often raise good kids with a work ethic and strong traditional values that put the native-born to shame. They're not a liability. They're an asset. Naturalized citizens explain why they're American by choice. But, c'mon. These people are not saints. With the exception of DREAM Act kids involuntarily brought here by their parents, these people did something wrong. Illegal immigrants either overstayed a visa or crossed a border without authorization. That was wrong. Then many of them doubled down on the misdeed by using fake documents to procure employment or not paying income taxes on money earned, even though the federal government has set up an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number that allows illegal immigrants to pay taxes. If that sounds harsh, blame my upbringing. I'm the grandson of a Mexican immigrant who came to the United States legally during the Mexican Revolution and my father spent 36 years as a cop. It's in my DNA to not make excuses for wrongdoing. My friends in the immigration reform community need to get over their uneasiness and stop sugar coating who these people are and what they've done to get here. We can't fix the problem of illegal immigration until we deal with it honesty and candidly. As Charlie mentioned, Justice Anthony Kennedy has an interesting take on illegal immigration, which he incorporated into the majority opinion in the recent Supreme Court decision striking down most of the Arizona immigration law. Kennedy wrote: \\"As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States.\\" True. But \\"present\\" doesn't just happen. The estimated 10 million illegal immigrants who are unlawfully in the United States didn't just appear one day like the genie out of Aladdin's lamp. Like the old saying goes: \\"If you see a turtle resting on a fence post, you can be sure someone put it there. It didn't get there by itself.\\" At some point in time, again with the exception of DREAM'ers, someone did something bad. That doesn't make them bad people. But they broke the law. We're not talking about criminal law, and so they're not \\"criminals.\\" Immigration law is based in civil law, and that's why those who break it get deported and not imprisoned. But these people are still lawbreakers, and -- by definition -- illegal immigrants. Sorry, Charlie. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","output":"In this thought-provoking article, the author argues against the claim that the phrase \\"illegal immigrant\\" is biased and racially offensive. The author states that the term is accurate, and it addresses the reality of people who have engaged in unlawful activities to enter or stay in a country. They also mention that many of those who oppose the term try to sanitize the situation by changing the language. The article highlights that immigration laws are based in civil law, which is why those who break it can be deported rather than imprisoned. The author argues for an honest and candid discussion about illegal immigration to fix the problem, rather than avoiding the issue due to political correctness or fears of appearing offensive.

Per an order handed down by the US District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, the 100-year-old Cleveland School District must adhere to a Justice Department plan and join together its two high schools (one made up of all black students save one), as well as merge its middle school (where all but two of its students are black) and junior high, reports the AP. The head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division says continuing to delay desegregation efforts there more than 60 years after the Supreme Court's Brown v.

The 100-year-old Cleveland School District must now comply with a Justice Department plan, which will see the two high schools, one of which is attended by all black students except one, combined. In addition, the district's middle school, where all but two students are black, must merge with the junior high. This decision comes after three previous attempts to desegregate the Mississippi Delta district. The head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has argued that continuing to delay the desegregation effort over 60 years after the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision is both \\"unacceptable and unconstitutional.\\" A district lawyer said school board members were discussing their next steps, and added that the district would prefer to keep open enrollment while appealing the decision.

This input revealed that black children in Cleveland perceived that white children attended better schools. By implementing this plan, the federal court aims to bridge the racial divide and ensure that all students in the district have equal access to quality education. The case highlights the ongoing struggle to desegregate schools in the United States, over six decades after the Supreme Court declared that racially segregated schools violated the Constitution. While significant progress has been made, there are still many areas where segregation persists, particularly in smaller towns and rural communities.

Premise: \\"A young man sitting behind a table with a microphone in front of him.\\" This tells us that there is a young man, he is sitting behind a table, and there is a microphone in front of him. Hypothesis: \\"A man is in a chair.\\" This states that there is a man sitting in a chair. Now, let's see if the premise tells us whether the hypothesis is true: 1. The premise states there's a young man, which we can assume to be a man. So there's a match in identifying the subject. 2. The premise mentions that the young man is sitting, and the hypothesis states that the man is sitting in a chair. Although the premise doesn't explicitly mention a chair, it's reasonable to assume that he is most likely sitting on a chair while positioned behind a table. Considering these points, we can conclude that the premise provides enough information to suggest that the hypothesis is likely true. However, it's essential to note that the chair's presence isn't directly mentioned in the premise, making it an inference rather than a definitive confirmation."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"In the given process, if more light energy is absorbed by the chlorophyll in a plant, it will directly impact the production of sugar, as light energy is a crucial factor in the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process through which plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. The process can be summarized through the following chemical equation: 6CO2 (carbon dioxide) + 6H2O (water) + light energy -> C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2 (oxygen) Here, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, the green pigment present in the chloroplasts of plant cells. This energy is then utilized to perform various steps involved in photosynthesis, including the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Considering the described process, it is evident that an increase in the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll directly impacts a step of the process, i.e., the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose. As a result, more sugar will be produced in the plant. When more light energy is absorbed, the rate at which the plant is able to carry out photosynthesis increases, thereby accelerating the utilization of carbon dioxide and the production of glucose. This additional glucose can then be used by the plant to fuel various cellular processes, growth, and reproduction. Additionally, the extra glucose can also be stored by the plant in the form of starch for use during periods of low light or when the plant's energy demands are higher. In conclusion, an increase in the amount of light energy absorbed by chlorophyll directly impacts a step of the process (conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose), leading to enhanced production of sugar in the plant."},{"instruction":"Felix, Huddersfield train station's cat, started her 5k run on Friday morning although station staff say she has been taking breaks by \\"lying down in the corridor\\".

Since Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips to make dough for cookies and there are 81 chocolate chips in a bag, he uses 81 chocolate chips for the cookie dough in total. Step 2: Calculate the total number of chocolate chips in all three batches. Since the dough makes three batches of cookies, we need to divide the total number of chocolate chips (81) by the number of batches (3) to find the number of chocolate chips in a single batch. 81 chocolate chips ÷ 3 batches = 27 chocolate chips per batch. Step 3: Determine the number of cookies in a batch. Each cookie has nine chocolate chips in it, so we need to divide the total number of chocolate chips in a batch (27) by the number of chocolate chips per cookie (9). 27 chocolate chips per batch ÷ 9 chocolate chips per cookie = 3 cookies.

As an artist, Francis Bacon was a late starter. He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s, when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs. He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest. He began to paint images based on the Crucifixion in 1933, when his then-patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject. These abstract figurations contain formal elements typical of their time, including diaphanous forms, flat backgrounds, and surrealist props such as flowers and umbrellas. The art critic Wieland Schmied noted that while the early works are \\"aesthetically pleasing\\", they lack \\"a sense of urgency or inner necessity; they are beautiful, but lifeless\\". The sentiment is echoed by Hugh Davies, who wrote that Bacon's 1933 paintings \\"suggest an artist concentrating more on formal than on expressive concerns\\". Bacon admitted that his early works were not successful; they were merely decorative and lacking in substance. He was often harshly self-critical during this period, and would abandon or destroy canvasses before they were completed. He abandoned the Crucifixion theme, then largely withdrew from painting in frustration, instead immersing himself in love affairs, drinking and gambling.When he returned to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, \\"I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.

Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801.

He is very happy because he will be able to afford the car of his dreams, a superb car worth 18000 €. He goes to the dealership and tries the car. He decides to take it, but instead of paying for everything right away, he chooses to pay in several installments. He pays 3,000 euros to be able to leave with the car and the seller offers to let him pay the rest in 6 monthly installments. How much does Mr. Lalande have to pay every month?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"First, we need to find out how much Mr. Lalande still owes after his initial payment of 3,000 euros. 1. Calculate the remaining balance: Remaining balance = Total cost of the car - Initial payment Remaining balance = 18,000 euros - 3,000 euros Remaining balance = 15,000 euros Now, Mr. Lalande needs to pay the remaining balance in 6 monthly installments. 2. Calculate the monthly payment: Monthly payment = Remaining balance / Number of installments Monthly payment = 15,000 euros / 6 Monthly payment = 2,500 euros So, Mr. Lalande has to pay 2,500 euros every month for 6 months to fully pay for the car."},{"instruction":"HORRENDOUS!

Leif Erikson Day commemorates his achievements and serves as a tribute to his exploratory spirit. Leif Erikson was born around 970 A.D. in Iceland and was the son of Erik the Red, the founder of Greenland's first Norse settlement. Erikson was believed to have grown up in Greenland, and it is likely that his curiosity about the lands lying to the West was influenced by his father's earlier explorations. While many people associate the discovery of America with Christopher Columbus, there is substantial evidence that points to Leif Erikson and his fellow Norsemen landing on the continent almost five centuries earlier. Around the year 1000 A.D., Leif Erikson embarked on a voyage based on stories he had heard from a merchant sailor named Bjarni Herjolfsson, who claimed to have spotted new lands far to the west. Sailing westward from Greenland, Erikson and his men first arrived at a rocky, barren land they named Helluland, which is believed to be modern-day Baffin Island in Canada. Next, they sailed southward to a heavily forested and more hospitable land, which they called Markland, possibly referring to the Labrador coast of Canada. Finally, continuing along the coast, they reached a place with a mild climate and fertile lands teeming with salmon and grapes, which they named Vinland. It is now widely believed that Vinland corresponds to the northern tip of Newfoundland, Canada. The Norse expedition established a temporary settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows, a site that has been extensively excavated and preserved as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Though the Norse settlements in North America didn't last long due to various factors, including conflicts with indigenous peoples and limited support from Greenland and Iceland, Leif Erikson's journey to North America marked a significant moment in the history of exploration. The Norse sagas, or stories, documenting his adventures were passed down orally before they were eventually written down in the 13th and 14th centuries, several hundred years after Erikson's time. In the United States, Leif Erikson Day was first observed on October 9th, 1929, after an initial push by Rasmus B. Anderson, a Norwegian-American teacher, and diplomat, who sought to establish the day to honor Erikson's accomplishments. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson officially established October 9th as Leif Erikson Day through a congressional resolution, and it has since been celebrated annually with proclamations from U.S. presidents and activities that aim to raise awareness about the explorer and his contributions to the history of exploration."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"La alusión tefachim diez a la letra \\"Yud\\" - la más pequeña de las letras hebreas, y la carta que alude a la Mundo por Venir.\\" from Spanish to English.","output":"Step 1: Identify the structure and grammar of the sentence in Spanish.

Personal development: The practice of spiritual science often encourages self-discovery and personal growth. It can promote deep introspection and self-awareness, leading to a better understanding of oneself and one's motivations. Additionally, it may aid in the cultivation of virtues such as compassion, humility, and gratitude, fostering a more balanced and fulfilling life. 3. Coping with life's challenges: By establishing a strong foundation in both rational and spiritual perspectives, individuals who pursue spiritual science may find they are better equipped to deal with life's challenges and hardships. This dual perspective provides a unique set of tools for managing stress, anxiety, grief, and other emotional challenges, as well as enhancing resilience and adaptability. 4. Connection with others: Exploring spiritual science can foster a sense of belonging and interconnectedness with others, breaking down the barriers between different cultures, traditions, and belief systems. This connection can lead to increased empathy and understanding, resulting in stronger relationships and a more harmonious global community. Benefits of spiritual science: 1. Enhanced well-being: A holistic understanding of human nature can contribute to improved mental, emotional, and physical well-being. By acknowledging the importance of spirituality in personal growth and healing, individuals may experience greater fulfillment, happiness, and inner peace. 2. Expanding viewpoints: Studying spiritual science provides an opportunity to learn from the wisdom and insights of various religious, spiritual, and philosophical traditions. This exposure broadens one's understanding and appreciation of diverse perspectives and may help challenge preconceived notions or biases—ultimately leading to personal growth and enrichment. 3. Greater mindfulness and awareness: Practitioners of spiritual science often engage in meditation, mindfulness practices, and other spiritual exercises, which can lead to increased self-awareness, concentration, and mental clarity. These skills are instrumental in reducing stress, managing emotions, and fostering a greater sense of overall well-being. 4.

Then somewhat unexpectedly in 1948, during a visit to Canada, Taoiseach John A. Costello announced that Ireland was to be declared a republic. The subsequent Irish legislation, the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, provided for the abolition of the last remaining functions of the King in relation to Ireland and provided that the President of Ireland would exercise these functions in the King's place. When the Act came into force on 18 April 1949, it effectively ended Ireland's status as a British dominion.

Among the allegations in that section: That Rivera was named the defendant in a 1994 domestic abuse case (something he and the victim both say isn’t true), that he got into a car crash with a truck carrying fliers about that case, and that state law enforcement agencies are investigating 500,000 that a dog track paid to Rivera's mother after he lobbied for it as a state legislator. Wikipedia quickly restored the section, which was well-sourced. Veiga deleted them again, but it was again quickly restored. The page has now been locked, with the controversy section intact—complete with a line about Veiga’s attempts to edit it.","output":"Title: David Rivera's Controversial Wikipedia Edits: A Battle Over Truth and Reputation Introduction: David Rivera, a politician with a history of controversies, has recently faced even more scrutiny after his press secretary attempted to edit his Wikipedia page. This effort to erase negative information and promote positive legislative accomplishments has sparked a discussion about public image and truth, as well as the role of aides in managing their boss's reputation on online platforms. The Editing Battle: Last month, as Rivera dealt with controversy after controversy, his press secretary, Leslie Veiga, decided to take matters into her own hands. Using the Wikipedia username \\"Lmveiga,\\" she made multiple edits to her boss's page, removing the entire controversies section and replacing it with legislative accomplishments copied directly from Rivera's campaign website. However, Wikipedia editors were quick to notice the changes and restored the deleted controversies section, which was well-sourced with verified information. Veiga persisted, attempting to delete the negative information again but was thwarted, as Wikipedia editors restored the section once more. The Controversies: Some of the allegations that Veiga tried to remove from Rivera's Wikipedia page include a 1994 domestic abuse case naming Rivera as the defendant, a car crash involving a truck carrying fliers about that case, and an investigation into a 500,000 payment made by a dog track to Rivera's mother after he lobbied for it as a state legislator. Both Rivera and the alleged abuse victim have denied the incident, but the remaining controversies continue to cast a shadow over his political career. Protecting Public Image: The efforts of Mr. Rivera's press secretary to alter his Wikipedia page raise questions about the responsibilities of aides in managing their boss's online reputation. While it is understandable that they would want to put forth a positive image of their employer, they must also adhere to ethical standards and not manipulate crucial information to mislead the public. Locking the Page: Following the back-and-forth edits, Wikipedia decided to lock Rivera's page, ensuring that no further changes could be made for the time being. The controversy surrounding the editing remains intact, along with a line explicitly mentioning Veiga's attempts to alter the page's content. Conclusion: The issue of public figures trying to erase or alter unfavorable information about themselves on the internet has been a topic of debate for years. In this age of digital transparency, reputation management is crucial, but so is ensuring that accurate information is available to the public. As seen in this case, the attempt to change David Rivera's story ultimately attracted more attention to his controversies and highlighted the importance of fact-checking and protecting the integrity of online platforms such as Wikipedia."},{"instruction":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -30*p + 13*p + 19*p + 30 = 0 for p.","output":"Okay, little buddy!

So, let's add -30*p, 13*p, and 19*p together. -30*p + 13*p + 19*p = (-30 + 13 + 19) * p = 2 * p Now the equation looks like this: 2*p + 30 = 0 Next, let's move the 30 to the other side of the equal sign by subtracting it. We will do the subtraction like this: 2*p - 30 = 0 Now, we have 2*p = -30 To find the value of \\"p\\", we need to divide both sides of the equation by \\"2\\".

Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment. McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive.

Step by step answer:","output":"Yes, we can determine that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Here's the step-by-step process to understand this: Step 1: Identify the key phrases in the premise The premise describes a \\"blond man in a printed shirt about to perform\\". The key phrases in this description are \\"blond man,\\" \\"printed shirt,\\" and \\"about to perform.\\" Step 2: Identify the key phrases in the hypothesis The hypothesis states \\"someone is ready to act.\\" The main phrases in the hypothesis are \\"someone\\" and \\"ready to act.\\" Step 3: Compare the two sets of key phrases for similarities Now, let's compare the key phrases in the premise with the key phrases in the hypothesis. We can see that \\"about to perform\\" in the premise is similar to \\"ready to act\\" in the hypothesis. Both statements suggest that a person is preparing to take some action or perform an activity. Step 4: Examine the context The context of both statements focuses on the same person, who is preparing to engage in a specific activity. While the premise provides a more detailed description of the individual (blond man in a printed shirt), the hypothesis offers a more generalized interpretation (someone) but still refers to the same person. Step 5: Determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise Since the key phrases in the two statements share similarity and describe the same individual preparing for an activity, we can determine that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Although the hypothesis doesn't specify the physical appearance of the person, it still captures the essence of them being ready to perform an action, which aligns with the information provided in the premise."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = Bibimbap House, food = Indian, area = riverside, near = The Rice Boat","output":"First, I will begin the sentence with an introduction to the restaurant's name, \\"Bibimbap House.\\" Second, I will incorporate the type of food they serve by mentioning \\"serves delicious Indian cuisine.\\" Third, I will describe the location of the restaurant by stating \\"located in the picturesque riverside area.\\" Lastly, I will add information about its proximity to a nearby landmark, \\"just a stone's throw away from The Rice Boat.\\" After completing these steps, the final sentence will be: \\"Bibimbap House serves delicious Indian cuisine, located in the picturesque riverside area, just a stone's throw away from The Rice Boat.\\""},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Debra: cool initiative Angelica: cool, good to hear there some zero-waste initiatives in the area Heather: yeah, nice Debra: what do you say we have a little decluttering party at my house?

However, Flight Navigator Lieutenant Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson), and Pilot Lieutenant Jeremy Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) are assigned a reconnaissance mission over Bosnia. During the reconnaissance mission, they spot suspicious activity in the no-fly zone that NATO aircraft are prohibited from entering. Burnett persuades Stackhouse to fly their F/A-18F Super Hornet off-course to get a close look on the target and they take photographs of the area. However, both men do not realize that they photographed mass graves, and Serbs in the area spot the jet. The local Bosnian Serb Army commander, General Miroslav Lokar (Olek Krupa), is involved in a secret genocidal campaign against the local Muslim population. Not wanting the mass graves to be discovered, Lokar orders the plane to be shot down.Despite trying to outmaneuver the missiles shot at them, their aircraft is hit and they are forced to eject.

Translate to English","output":"The Greek government is calling for a dialogue on ways to improve the education system, which currently ranks last among education indices in the Eurozone. The Greek government recognizes the urgent need to address the shortcomings of its education system, as it lags behind its Eurozone counterparts in educational indices. To tackle this issue, numerous steps could be implemented to ensure substantial improvements in educational quality and outcomes for the Greek youth. Firstly, one of the primary concerns is the limited availability of resources and funding for educational institutions across the country. Addressing this issue requires an increased commitment to financial investment in education by the Greek government and potential support from Eurozone partners. In addition, partnerships with private and international organizations could be explored to bring about innovative funding models to sustainably finance improvements in education. Secondly, there is the issue of outdated curriculum and pedagogical practices. The Greek government should encourage and facilitate a comprehensive review and update of the education curriculum, incorporating 21st-century learning priorities such as digital literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Moreover, ensuring that schools in Greece are equipped with modern teaching tools, technologies, and resources will be crucial for moving the education system forward. Thirdly, the professional development of teachers needs to be given high priority. Qualitative improvement in education can be nurtured by offering training and development opportunities to educators, including coaching, workshops, and mentorship programs. Incentivizing professional growth and collaboration within the teaching community will foster the exchange of best practices, improve teaching quality, and ultimately benefit the students. An emphasis should be placed on promoting social inclusiveness and equal access to quality education for all Greek children, regardless of their socio-economic background or geographic location. Policies should be designed to break down barriers in accessing education and fully integrate marginalized or disadvantaged groups into the education system. Furthermore, fostering a strong connection between education and the Greek labor market is essential for equipping the country's youth with marketable skills and increasing their employability. This could be done by integrating vocational training and career guidance into the curriculum, emphasizing the importance of lifelong learning, and promoting collaboration between educational institutions and industry sectors. Finally, the Greek government should focus on better allocating resources and finding innovative ways to enhance overall efficiency in the administration of the education system. Streamlining the management process and consistently evaluating the system's performance using clearly defined metrics can drive targeted improvements. In conclusion, improving the Greek education system requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses financial investment, curriculum modernization, teacher professional development, social inclusiveness, labor market alignment, and efficient resource allocation. Through a collaborative effort between the Greek government and its Eurozone partners, meaningful and sustainable improvements can be achieved for the long-term betterment of the education system in Greece and, ultimately, the future of its citizens."},{"instruction":"Toutefois, le développement n'est pas une conséquence automatique de cette ouverture.

One of them is our Anita \\"Needy\\" Lesnicky (Amanda Seyfried), a blond-haired, nerdy, substantially unpopular, \\"plain Jane\\" student. The other focus is on Jennifer Check (Megan Fox), a beautiful black-haired girl who is a cheerleader on the school's flag team.

An obnoxious Oriental kid chides Needy for being 'lesbi-gay' but she just points out \\"sandbox love is forever.\\"One evening, Jennifer has Needy accompany her to Melody Lane, a local bar, where an indie rock band named Low Shoulder is playing. It seems odd, so unlikely that they would bother to perform at such an insignificant venue, but frontman Nikolai Wolf (Adam Brody) explains that it is a service to their fans. Needy overhears him referring to Jennifer, who is fetching them drinks (getting past the age restriction barrier by playing Hello Titty with the bartender off-camera), as the State Fair Butter Queen, the perennial small-town virgin who loves 'showing it off' but remains a teaser. Obviously, he has unresolved issues with girls. During the performance, the bar catches on fire, but Nikolai gazes on with a smirk, and Needy leads a shocked Jennifer to safety through the toilet window, just barely escaping from being killed in the blaze.

The original line-up consisted of Fred Schneider (vocals), Kate Pierson (vocals, keyboards), Cindy Wilson (vocals, percussion), Ricky Wilson (lead guitar), and Keith Strickland (drums, rhythm guitar, keyboards). After Ricky Wilson's death from AIDS-related illness in 1985, Strickland switched from drums to lead guitar. The band also added touring members for albums and live performances. Context: In 1979 the B-52's signed contracts as they flew over to Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas to record their debut studio album, with Island founder Chris Blackwell producing. The band was surprised by Blackwell's recording methods; he wanted to keep the sound as close as possible to their actual live sound so used almost no overdubs or additional effects. Released on July 6, 1979, The B-52's contained re-recorded versions of \\"Rock Lobster\\" and \\"52 Girls\\", six originals recorded solely for the album, and a cover of the Petula Clark single \\"Downtown\\". The album was a major success, especially in Australia where it reached number three on the charts alongside its three singles \\"Planet Claire,\\" \\"Rock Lobster,\\" and \\"Dance This Mess Around.\\" In the United States, the single \\"Rock Lobster\\" reached the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the album itself was certified platinum by the RIAA. In 1980, John Lennon called the B-52's his favorite band and specifically cited \\"Rock Lobster\\" as an inspiration for his comeback with Double Fantasy. In April 1980, as with their first album, The B-52's traveled to Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas to record the follow-up. Several of the songs from the album had been concert staples since 1978; the band consciously did not record them for their first album because they had too many tracks and wanted a strong second album, knowing that performing the tracks live would make fans look forward to it. Rhett Davies co-produced the album, with more emphasis put on slick production; the album has a slightly more psychedelic and even paranoid sound than that of their debut. Released on August 27, 1980, Wild Planet was well received by critics, most of whom regarded it as a strong second album following the success of their first; many fans consider it their best album. The album reached number eighteen on the Billboard 200 chart in 1980 and was certified gold; \\"Private Idaho\\" became their second Hot 100 entry. On January 26, 1980, The B-52's performed on Saturday Night Live; they also performed at the Heatwave festival (billed as the \\"New Wave Woodstock\\") in Toronto, Canada in August 1980, and appeared in the Paul Simon film One Trick Pony. In July 1981, Party Mix! was released, a six-song collection containing songs from their first two albums remixed and sequenced to form two long tracks, one on each side. In 1981, the band collaborated with Talking Heads' David Byrne to produce a third full-length studio album. Due to alleged conflicts with Byrne over the album's musical direction, recording sessions for the album were aborted, prompting the band to release Mesopotamia in 1982 as an EP. In 1991, Party Mix! and Mesopotamia, the latter of which had been remixed, were combined and released together on a single compact disc. It was also in 1982 that the band appeared at the inaugural US Festival. They performed on the first day of the festival alongside Talking Heads, Oingo Boingo, and The Police.

That would just be 3! Divide each number by 2 if you have two even digits.","output":"To determine the most logical next event, it is important to first understand the context. If we are discussing the topic of finding half of any given number, the next logical event would revolve around providing a more detailed explanation and additional methods for finding half of a number. Here, I will provide a comprehensive understanding of finding half of any number and different methods that can be employed: 1. The most straightforward method: Divide the given number by 2. This is the most common and simplest approach to find half of a number. Simply dividing the given number by 2 will give you the correct result. For example, to find half of 8, you would divide 8 by 2, which equals 4. This method works for all numbers, including even, odd, fractions, and decimals. 2. The mentioned method: Multiply the number by 5 and move the decimal point to the left. This method works specifically for whole numbers that are divisible by 2. While this method may not be suitable for all numbers, it does work for some and can be a fun alternative approach. For example, to find half of 6, you would multiply 6 (six) by 5, which equals 30. Then, move the decimal point one place to the left to get 3.0, or simply 3. 3. The \\"two even digits\\" method: Divide each digit by 2 (specific condition). This method is only applicable when dealing with a two-digit whole number where both digits are even. In this case, you can divide each digit by 2 and place them next to each other to find half of the number. For example, to find half of 64, you would divide 6 by 2, which equals 3, and 4 by 2, which equals 2. The result is 32. However, this method is not applicable to numbers with odd digits or numbers with more or fewer than two digits. 4. Use a calculator or an app. Many calculators and smartphone apps are available that can help you find half of any number easily and quickly. This is especially useful when dealing with large, complex, or decimal numbers. 5. Convert fractions to decimals and vice versa. For finding half of a fraction, either perform the division by 2 directly on the fraction or convert the fraction to a decimal and then divide by 2. To convert back to a fraction, you can use various techniques, like the common denominator method, or use an online fraction-to-decimal converter for convenience. In conclusion, the most logical next event after discussing this specific method of finding half of a given number would be to elaborate on different methods for finding half a number or providing examples and scenarios where these methods are useful. Understanding multiple methods can be beneficial for different situations and help develop a well-rounded understanding for various mathematical contexts."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - Martin M.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Step by step answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the premise. The premise states that \\"A woman with a woven yellow scarf on her head carries a bag of food.\\" This gives us information about the woman's appearance (she has a yellow scarf on her head) and what she is doing (carrying a bag of food). Step 2: Understand the hypothesis. The hypothesis claims that \\"The woman is bringing the food home.\\" This is an assumption about where the woman is taking the bag of food. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis. The premise provides information about the woman's appearance and that she is carrying a bag of food. However, the hypothesis makes an assumption about the destination of the food, which is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Since the premise does not provide information about where the woman is taking the bag of food, we cannot confirm or deny the hypothesis based solely on the information given in the premise.

Ken Holtzman pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings. Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 1⁄2 game in front. Disaster followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back.

San Diego (CNN) -- President Obama's critics have the right to be upset by his decision to shield from deportation, at least temporarily, some groups of undocumented immigrants. But they don't have the right to twist the facts, use inflammatory language and create confusion. They're the ones who are most confused. They don't appear to have the foggiest idea how the process would work. That's their own fault. They should have paid closer attention two years ago, the last time the administration did something like this, with the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Simply put, Obama is using the executive power granted to him by the Constitution to reshuffle the immigration enforcement deck and prioritize deportations so that, for instance, the undocumented parents of U.S.-born citizens get a temporary \\"deferred\\" status and thus can't be removed for three years. If it's the latter, a large number of undocumented immigrants -- media reports have put the potential figure at 5 million, although the actual figure is likely to be much lower, given the response to","output":"the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program -- would be able to come out of the shadows, register with the government, and work legally without fear of deportation for a three-year period. This would enable them to contribute to the U.S. economy, pay taxes, and further integrate into American society. Critics argue that this move would encourage more undocumented immigrants to enter the country, but the reality is that this deferred status is temporary and does not offer a pathway to citizenship or even permanent residency. Therefore, it is not an incentive for further illegal immigration. As the story unfolds, we would likely see various reactions and consequences that stem from Obama's decision to implement this executive action: 1. Legal challenges: Opponents of the action are likely to mount legal challenges in an attempt to overturn the decision. However, given the fact that the executive branch is responsible for enforcing immigration laws, and that past presidents have also exercised executive action relating to immigration, it is uncertain whether these challenges would ultimately succeed. 2. Political backlash: The decision is sure to fuel political debates and further polarize the issue of immigration. While some may view the move as a compassionate and pragmatic approach to address the situation of undocumented immigrants, others may see it as executive overreach and a disregard for the rule of law. 3. Impact on the undocumented immigrants: Those who qualify for deferred status would experience a significant change in their lives. The ability to work legally can help them secure better jobs, improve their living conditions, and access better educational opportunities for their children. Additionally, their families would feel more secure, knowing that they would not be separated due to deportation. 4. Economic implications: The temporary legal status of millions of immigrants could potentially contribute to the U.S. economy. These individuals would be more likely to pay taxes, open bank accounts, and contribute to the growth of various industries. Some studies have predicted positive economic impacts from similar moves in the past. 5. Future reforms: This executive action might prompt Congress to finally tackle comprehensive immigration reform. While the temporary nature of this action underscores the need for permanent solutions, the increased attention on the issue could pressure lawmakers to act on bipartisan legislation. In the end, the story would witness President Obama's decision having significant consequences for the individuals affected, the political landscape, and the U.S. as a whole. The precise long-term impact would depend on the response of Congress and how subsequent administrations choose to address immigration. Ultimately, though, the story highlights the complexity of the immigration issue and the importance of finding humane and realistic solutions for those living in the country without proper documentation."},{"instruction":"Article:It now expects the economy to expand by 5.3% this year, down from its earlier projection of 6.4% growth. The new growth outlook is in line with the projections of the central bank and many other economists. The council also warned that keeping the fiscal deficit within the budget target of 4.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) \\"could be a challenge\\". In its latest economic outlook, the council said that the fiscal deficit during the first four months of the current financial year had already reached 62.8% of the budgetary provision for the full year. India's growth has been hurt by a range of factors in recent months. including a slowdown in key sectors such as mining and manufacturing. At the same time, a lack of crucial reforms has seen foreign investors become sceptical of entering the country. The situation has become worse in recent months as many investors have pulled out from the country. A slowdown in India's growth, coupled with a recovery in developed markets such as the US - which has made India a less attractive investment option - has prompted them to look for other options. The prospect of the US withdrawing a key stimulus programme sooner than expected and a possible rise in interest rates in the US have also played a role in the pull-out. This has hurt India's currency, which has dipped as much 20% against the US dollar since May this year. That has made imports more expensive, hurting India's economy even more, not least because of its already high current account deficit. A current account deficit happens when the country's import bill is bigger than its earnings from exports. A widening deficit puts strain on the nation's foreign exchange reserves. In its report, the council said the sharp decline in the currency had not only hurt efforts to bring the deficit under control, but was a hurdle in kick-starting growth. \\"The currency problems have momentarily interrupted the process of revival of growth,\\" it said.

There are many reasons why India's growth is slower, like problems in mining and manufacturing, and foreign investors not wanting to put their money in India. People are also worried that India might spend more money than they planned to.

Their annual tradition of joining the festivities in outrageous costumes has become part of local legend. It is the night before Halloween, however, and they still have not decided what to be. Evan and Harvey, who are femme gay boyfriends and business partners, have come up with food-themed sushi costumes that everyone refers to as \\"wasabi tuna.\\" Emme offers another suggestion — that they all dress up as gang members. They all opt for the gang theme, but are unable to find the appropriate attire at the local stores. They then decide to seek out real life gang members in order to achieve the authentic, straight-from-the-hood look they want. While doing interior design work for an extremely wealthy Armenian woman who is actually in the illegal drug trade, Harvey and Evan become unwitting drug couriers.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The question mentioned involves two separate concepts: boiling water and the burning of mass by a red giant star. It seems that the intention is to understand the connection between these two phenomena and how a perturbation in one might affect the other. First, let's discuss the boiling water process. When you add water to a pot, put the pot over a source of heat, and turn the heat on, the water receives thermal energy. This energy transfer causes the water molecules to move faster, ultimately leading to the formation of bubbles and steam when the water reaches its boiling point. This is a physical process dependent on the heat source and the amount of water in the pot. On the other hand, a red giant star is a celestial object, characterized by its size and luminosity. It has entered a late stage in its life cycle, where it starts burning its mass, converting hydrogen into helium, and subsequently other heavier elements as it runs out of lighter elements to fuse. This nuclear fusion process releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of heat and light. Now, to address the supposed perturbation involving the red giant burning more mass, we must determine if this perturbation directly impacts, indirectly impacts, or does not impact any step of the boiling water process. In this case, the perturbation of a red giant star burning more mass is not directly impacting any step of the boiling water process. The reason for this is that the process of boiling water relies on factors such as the heat source and the amount of water - which are unrelated to the properties and behavior of a red giant star. The red giant operates at astronomical distances and has no direct influence on the heat source being used to boil water on Earth. However, it is essential to note that the energy generated by stars, including our own Sun, indirectly impacts almost every aspect of life on Earth. The Sun's energy drives various processes on our planet, including photosynthesis, wind currents, and climate. Although these processes do not impact the boiling water process directly, they contribute to the overall conditions that allow us to carry out such actions. In conclusion, the perturbation of more mass being burned by a red giant would not directly impact any step of the boiling water process. Its effects, if any, will be very minimal and indirect, given the vast distances and the localized nature of the boiling water experiment. Hence, the correct answer is that the perturbation is indirectly impacting a step of the process, but it's important to emphasize that the indirect impact is negligible."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and answer the question.

The Upper West Side is sometimes also considered by the real estate industry to include the neighborhood of Morningside Heights. - In physics, a standing wave also known as a stationary wave is a wave in a medium in which each point on the axis of the wave has an associated constant amplitude. The locations at which the amplitude is minimum are called nodes, and the locations where the amplitude is maximum are called antinodes. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.

This evening he went home with 105 in profit and 18 watermelons. How many watermelons did he start out with this morning? Your thoughts:","output":"Let's start by figuring out how many watermelons Carl sold in order to make 105 in profit. Here's our step-by-step plan: 1. Determine how much money Carl made from selling watermelons. 2. Find the number of watermelons sold. 3. Add the number of watermelons sold to the remaining 18 watermelons to determine the total number of watermelons Carl started with this morning. Step 1: Determine how much money Carl made from selling watermelons. Carl made 105 in profit by selling watermelons at 3 each. Step 2: Find the number of watermelons sold. To find the number of watermelons sold, we will divide his total profit by the price of each watermelon. Number of watermelons sold = 105 / 3 = 35 watermelons Step 3: Add the number of watermelons sold to the remaining 18 watermelons. Now we know that Carl sold 35 watermelons and still had 18 watermelons remaining. We can find the total number of watermelons he started with by adding these two amounts together: Total watermelons = 35 watermelons (sold) + 18 watermelons (remaining) = 53 watermelons Carl started out with 53 watermelons this morning."},{"instruction":"Find the right ending to this passage.

Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If the Sun's gravity is less strong, this would result in a reduced force pulling its mass inward. Consequently, there would be less pressure on the Sun. The decreased pressure would likely cause a reduction in the rate of nuclear reactions, as hydrogen atoms would not fuse together as effectively.

The people of Mandron use many fossil fuels to power things that require electricity. The people of Liptar have found a way to use water as a source of power and they barely use any fossil fuels at all. Hint: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive.

Step 3: Less insulin is needed due to reduced sugar levels in the bloodstream. Since less insulin is required, there will be less insulin available to help your body store the energy in fat, muscle, and liver cells. The second effect, which is the storage of energy, will be influenced negatively. Step 4: Negative impact on energy storage in fat, muscle, and liver cells due to less insulin. Answer: Less effect."},{"instruction":"Consider the question. Do ants outperform apes on language ability? If the answer is 'no'; explain the reasoning:","output":"The answer is no; ants do not outperform apes on language ability. Here's the reasoning behind this conclusion: 1. Biological differences: Apes, being primates, have a more complex and developed brain structure compared to ants. This allows for greater cognitive abilities, including language and communication. 2. Vocalization and gestures: Apes are known to use vocalizations, gestures, and body language to communicate with one another. Some apes, such as chimpanzees and bonobos, have even been taught to use sign language to communicate with humans. In contrast, ants primarily rely on chemical signals called pheromones for communication, which lack the complexity and versatility of vocalizations or gestures. 3. Symbolic representation: Apes have demonstrated an ability to understand symbolic representation, such as associating a sign or symbol with a specific meaning or object. This is a fundamental component of human language, and while ants have some level of symbolic communication in following pheromone trails and recognizing nestmates, their abilities are not as developed. 4. Expressing complex ideas: Apes are capable of expressing more abstract and complex ideas through their communication, while ants primarily transmit basic information related to food sources, danger, and colony maintenance. Apes can convey emotions and intent, but ants' communication is limited to functional purposes. 5. Learning: Apes have the ability to learn and adapt their communication skills through experience and social interaction. They can even learn to understand and use certain aspects of human language when taught. Ants, on the other hand, have a more instinctual and less adaptable communication system, which is primarily genetically determined. Overall, apes possess a much higher level of language ability than ants, due to their more developed brain structure, greater cognitive abilities, and more versatile communication methods."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A woman irons clothing in a bedroom with hardwood floors.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"There is clothing in a bedroom.\\" is true?

Yep. It's the ugliest, most alien-looking, fatal and pervasive monster in the seas. Garbage patches have been getting a lot of attention lately. These are areas on the seas where currents and winds tend to concentrate floating garbage. Do you remember when this one hit the headlines? It's not so gigantic, at four meters long, but it was observed 3,380 meters down in the Pacific Ocean near Oahu. It's pretty big to have gone unseen before its May 2001 discovery. So what else is out there? It's pretty clear marine biologists have only just begun discovering what lives in the deep sea. The more time they spend searching, the more they will find. But none would dispute that the nastiest sea monster to ever rise out of the sea is ... (drum roll please) ... How about giant, ship-destroying squid and octopi? These monsters were old hat even to the easily freaked-out. Most folks figured they were historical exaggerations. That's until some very large and unusual squids started washing up or being hauled in by marine biologists in recent years. Colossal squid are meters long, pretty amazing beasts. Still, they have never been known to lift ships out of the water. And since were on the topic of squids ... Giant Squid Photos Another possibility is that merfolk were inspired by fish with roughly human-looking faces, like this fellow. First Face? Prehistoric Fish Was a Jaw-Dropper Some fish can look humanoid. That would be enough to get superstitious sailors started. The manatee has often been called the source of mermaid myths. It's a mammal, so it breathes air. But who would ever mistake a manatee for a sleek and beautiful mermaid? Could it be love-starved sailors with poor eyesight? There was no shortage of these fellows in the days before optometrists. Mermaids and mermen have always been the stuff of fantasy. Where did the fantasies come from? There are some standard answers to this question, which have always seemed rather inadequate. For instance ... (next slide, if you please) ... Mermaids Exist! And They Are Seismically Sensitive There are also other, newfound \\"sea serpents\\" our sea-going ancestors never imagined. This one was spotted by a satellite coiling off the south coast of Japan's Hokkaido island. What do we know about it? 1) It's arguably one of the largest organisms on Earth, 2) It swallows ships, engulfs islands and generally does what it wants, and 3) We're darned lucky it's made of plankton. Monster Goldfish Found in Lake Tahoe Research into such massive blooms and the individual plankton cells that comprise them has revealed surprising cooperation among the microorganisms. They appear to operate like more than just floating individual cells. They live and die for the greater good, it seems. So they may be, in fact, a gigantic watery superorganism. Now that's a cool monster for you: You can swim in it and never know you've been in the belly of a beast. Maybe it's the oarfish. It looks too monstrous to be true. It can grow many meters long, has strikingly bright silver scales, scarlet fins and some ornate headgear that more than explains why some call it a roosterfish. If only it were a reptile, it'd be a true sea serpent. Alas. It is a fish. A very weird and beautiful fish, but still a fish. Is the Loch Ness Monster Dead? Sea monsters are truly global.

Cultures with seafaring traditions are especially ripe in what seem like the tallest sea monster tales of all: hydra, kraken, sirens, scylla, leviathans, assorted serpents and mermaids. Usually the stories are never confirmed and usually baseless. Then again, some of the tales are based on something, or so we are learning as marine scientists plumb the depths and discover some pretty weird creatures. The bottom line: There really are bizarre, unexpected, totally startling monsters found in the seas. And the very worst of these is the most unexpected. VIDEO: Real Life Sea Monsters A motorboat-sized beast that was at the top of its food chain 170 million years ago is Scotland's first known native marine reptile. The formidable ocean predator, described in the latest issue of the Scottish Journal of Geology, might have munched on dinosaurs and sharks, since both also lived at or around what is now the Isle of Skye. The predator was an ichthyosaur, meaning an extinct marine reptile that had a pointy head, four flippers and a vertical tail. Together, these features made such animals look like sinister dolphins. A group of paleontologists working in Scotland studied the remains of the newly discovered ichthyosaur, named Dearcmhara shawcrossi. Dearcmhara --[/i ]pronounced jark vara -- is Scottish Gaelic for \\"marine lizard.\\" The species is one of just a handful ever to have been given a Gaelic name. Play Video Real Life Sea Monsters Sea monsters are real! See the coolest (and most terrifying) creatures in the sea. DNews Video \\"Believe it or not, this is the first distinctly Scottish marine reptile species that has ever been described, and our paper is the first paper on ichthyosaurs from Scotland,\\" project leader Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences told Discovery News. Remains of the animal were found at the Isle of Skye's Bearreraig Bay, where amateur collector Brian Shawcross found them. Instead of keeping or selling them, which often happens, Shawcross donated the specimens to the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. This allowed researchers to study them, determine their significance and piece together what this animal looked like in the flesh. \\"It would have been roughly 14 feet long or so, and probably would have fed on fish and marine invertebrates,\\" Brusatte said. Much of Skye was under water 170 million years ago. Skye was joined to the rest of the U.K. then, and was part of a large island positioned between land masses that gradually drifted apart and became Europe and North America. Sharks in the region during the marine reptile's lifetime were generally smaller and more primitive than today's sharks, so it's possible that Dearcmhara ate them. As for dinos, Brusatte said, \\"Dinosaurs did live in other parts of Scotland at the same general time as this ichthyosaur was living in the water. We know this from other rare fossils from Skye -- bones, teeth and footprints of very different type of dinosaurs, including big long-necked sauropods and carnivorous theropods.\\" If any waded or fell into the shallow, warm seas where Dearcmhara lived, they likely would have been dinner for the stealthy ichthyosaur. Nick Fraser of National Museums Scotland is excited by the discovery, and what it means for his country. \\"Scotland is well noted for its geology and geologists, including perhaps the most famous of all, James Hutton (often dubbed the Father of Modern Geology, although he lived from 1726 to 1797),\\" Fraser told Discovery News. \\"However, it is not widely noted in the public realm for its fossils, which is unfortunate, as it boasts some incredibly important localities and specimens.\\" He explained that remains for prehistoric fishes and very early reptiles from the Triassic have been found in Scotland. \\"Admittedly, there are not the huge rock exposures in Scotland that permit the excavation of spectacular death-beds of dinosaurs as you might find in the American West,\\" Fraser said. \\"Yet, even some of the fragmentary remains that we do find are often of great scientific importance, and that is certainly the case with the Skye Jurassic fossils.\\" Fraser said that the remains represent a time period, the Middle Jurassic, which is rather poorly known worldwide in the fossil record. Evidence, however, from surrounding periods suggests that animal life then, in the seas and on land, was incredibly rich and diverse. \\"Skye now seems set to play something of a starring role in shedding light on this window in time,\\" Fraser said. Both he and Brusatte also have a message for amateur fossil collectors in Scotland. \\"If you find fossil vertebrate specimens in Scotland, those of us in the scientific community would love to work with you,\\" Brusatte said. \\"If you work with us and donate your fossils to a museum, you might also get a new species named after you!\\" ||||| A handful of ancient bones found on the Isle of Skye more than 50 years ago belonged to a new species of marine predator, scientists have discovered. The prehistoric reptile – the first ichthyosaur from Scotland to be described in the scientific literature – measured nearly 14 feet from snout to tail. Unique and distinct features on the animal’s main fin bone suggest that it had different musculature from other ichthyosaurs, which may have made it a stronger swimmer. A local fossil enthusiast, Brian Shawcross, found the fossilised bones at Bearreraig Bay in 1959 and donated them to the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. But the pieces, belonging to the back, tail and fin, were not recognised as a new species until paleontologists surveyed the remains recently. To express their gratitude to Shawcross – and to encourage other private collectors to donate their own fossils to science rather than sell them on eBay – the researchers have named the new species after the enthusiast. Officially named Dearcmhara shawcrossi, the species is one of few to have a Gaelic name; the first part is pronounced “jark vara”, and means marine lizard. The species is described for the first time in the Scottish Journal of Geology today. “It’s not the prettiest specimen in the world. You can hold all of the bones in one hand. But it’s the first time we’ve recognised a distinctly Scottish prehistoric marine reptile,” said Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh. The reptile dates from the middle Jurassic, about 170m years ago, when Skye was home to lagoons and partly submerged. Ichthyosaurs were among the top marine predators, sharing the seas with long-necked plesiosaurs, and feeding on abundant fish and other marine reptiles. Despite the remains of the ichthyosaur being so scant, Brusatte said that distinct features on the upper fin bone suggested the Scottish species was new to science. One end of the bone has a large, triangular projection, where muscle would have been attached. Another unique feature is a deep pit on the same bone, which was probably linked to ligaments. “These two distinct features are very strong evidence that it’s a new species,” said Brusatte. “They have something to do with musculature. Maybe they made it swim faster. We just don’t know.” Ichthyosaurs had four strong fins and lived over a period of 150m years. The more primitive forms, such as the Scottish specimen, were typically smaller, but these gave way to larger creatures with bigger eyes, which became the dominant marine reptiles around the world until they became extinct in the Cretaceous. Brusatte said that paleontologists were now surveying all fossils from Skye, and called on private collectors to share their specimens. “What people find may be really important and it would be great if there was a way to preserve them for posterity. They are part of Scotland’s heritage,” he said. • This article was amended on 16 January 2015 because an earlier version said the ichthyosaur measured nearly 14m from snout to tail. This has been corrected to say nearly 14 feet. ||||| The newly identified prehistoric marine reptile Dearcmhara shawcrossi, a member of a group called ichthyosaurs that swam the world's oceans at the same time that dinosaurs ruled the land, is depicted in this handout illustration provided by Todd Marshall. Scotland has its very own prehistoric marine reptile - and, no, we're not talking about Nessie, the mythic Loch Ness monster. Scientists have announced the discovery of the fossil remains of a dolphin-like seagoing reptile on Scotland's Isle of Skye that lived about 170 million years ago and was about 14 feet (4.3 meters) long. The creature, named Dearcmhara shawcrossi, is a member of a group called ichthyosaurs that were among the dominant marine reptiles when dinosaurs ruled the land. Ichthyosaurs, some of which reached monstrous proportions rivaling all but the largest of today's whales, thrived for more than 150 million years until disappearing about 95 million years ago. Dearcmhara, a moderate-sized ichthyosaur, swam in warm, shallow seas during the Jurassic Period, eating fish and squid. Its remains are incomplete but the shape of a bone in its front flippers suggests it may have been an especially strong or fast swimmer, the researchers said. \\"It is from Scotland, and is the first uniquely Scottish marine reptile ever discovered and studied,\\" said University of Edinburgh paleontologist Steve Brusatte, one of the researchers in the study published on Monday in the Scottish Journal of Geology. \\"Many other marine reptile fossils have been found in Scotland, but the vast majority of these have disappeared into private collections or been sold. This new specimen finally breaks the impasse: it was found by a private collector who did a great thing, donated it to a museum and worked with scientists,\\" Brusatte added. Amateur fossil hunter Brian Shawcross found the fossils on a beach in the northern part of the Isle of Skye in 1959 and donated them in the 1990s, researchers said. The genus name Dearcmhara (pronounced \\"jark vara\\") is Scottish Gaelic for \\"marine lizard.\\" The species name honors Shawcross. \\"It is important to emphasize how grateful we are that Brian donated the bones he found all those years ago,\\" added paleontologist Neil Clark of the University of Glasgow's Hunterian Museum, which received the fossils. The discovery sheds light on a span of the Jurassic regarded as nearly a black hole in the marine reptile fossil record, Brusatte said. Scotland is one of the few places with fossils from that time. Other fossils indicate Dearcmhara lived alongside members of another branch of marine reptiles called plesiosaurs, known for long necks and paddle-like flippers. The elusive Nessie is commonly portrayed as looking like a plesiosaur. (Reporting by Will Dunham in Washington; Editing by Eric Beech) ||||| Abstract Fossils of Mesozoic vertebrates are rare in Scotland, particularly specimens of marine reptiles such as plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs. We describe a suite of ichthyosaur fossils from the Early to Middle Jurassic of Skye, which to our knowledge are the first ichthyosaurs from Scotland to be described and figured in detail. These fossils span approximately 30 million years, from the Sinemurian to the Bathonian, and indicate that ichthyosaurs were a major component of Scottish marine faunas during this time. The specimens include isolated teeth that could represent the most northerly known occurrences of the widespread Sinemurian species Ichthyosaurus communis, a characteristic component of the famous Lyme Regis faunas of England, suggesting that such faunas were also present in Scotland during the Early Jurassic. An associated humerus and vertebrae from Toarcian–Bajocian-aged deposits are named as a new genus and species of basal neoichthyosaurian, Dearcmhara shawcrossi. The taxonomic affinities of this taxon, which comes from a critical but poorly sampled interval in the fossil record, suggest that non-ophthalmosaurid neoichthyosaurians dominated European assemblages around the Early–Middle Jurassic boundary, and were later replaced by ophthalmosaurids, whose radiation likely took place outside Europe. Many of these specimens were collected by amateurs and donated to museum collections, a co-operative relationship essential to the preservation of Scotland’s fossil heritage. |||||Summary:","output":"Scientists have discovered a new species of ichthyosaur, a dolphin-like marine reptile, on Scotland's Isle of Skye.

With a storyline as uninspired as the haze of a midsummer's day, this film should have never seen the light of day. The plot centers around a group of barely likable characters embarking on an ill-fated treasure hunt in the Amazon rainforest. While the premise alone seems promising, Thompson fails miserably at delivering any excitement, substance, or memorable dialogue - a fatal mistake in an already negative composition. To call the acting \\"subpar\\" would be an insult to subpar performances everywhere. The lead actor, Mark Smith, spends most of the film either wooden or overacting, making it impossible for audiences to connect with the character on any level. To make matters worse, the supporting cast flounders in maintaining even the tiniest semblance of believability, creating a dissonance that's impossible to ignore. One of the most painful elements of Sunshine Inferno is the atrocious use of CGI. Every painfully obvious visual effect, from poorly animated monsters to fire that looks as though it was imported from an amateur YouTube video, serves to remind viewers that this movie was a waste of production resources. Action sequences are a hodgepodge of clichés and shortcuts, leaving one to wonder if the stunt coordinator was even present during filming. As the movie trudges on, the plot becomes increasingly convoluted and riddled with illogical twists and turns that leave viewers scratching their heads in sheer disbelief. The film's needlessly long runtime of 145 minutes is only exaggerated further by the plodding pacing. Many scenes leave audiences scrambling for the fast-forward button, seeking respite from the on-screen catastrophe. In a final attempt to push the boundaries of bad filmmaking, Sunshine Inferno ends with an insultingly abrupt cliffhanger, cynically setting up a sequel that is, quite honestly, dreaded. This final affront to taste leaves moviegoers feeling further cheated out of their precious time and hard-earned money. Sunshine Inferno is best described as a cinematic black hole, sucking the joy and interest out of viewing experiences with its negative sentiment.

Answer:","output":"The renowned 19th-century Japanese artist, Katsushika Hokusai, created a series of 36 prints known as the \\"Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji\\" (富嶽三十六景, Fugaku Sanjūrokkei). The series, conceived and produced during the Edo period (between 1830 and 1832), depicts Japan's highest and most celebrated mountain, Mount Fuji, from multiple perspectives and in various seasons, capturing its distinct beauty and cultural significance. Hokusai was a prominent ukiyo-e artist who greatly influenced the European art world, particularly the Impressionists, with his unconventional compositions and innovative artwork. Ukiyo-e, which translates to \\"pictures of the floating world,\\" is a genre of Japanese art that encompasses woodblock prints and paintings. It generally features subjects such as sumo wrestlers, kabuki actors, beautiful women, folk tales, travel scenes, and landscapes. In the \\"Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji\\" series, Hokusai masterfully uses a combination of three primary elements: traditional Japanese landscapes, Western perspective techniques, and Prussian blue pigment. The series' unique compositions, bold color choices, and diverse depiction of Mount Fuji made it a popular and influential set of artworks. Perhaps the most famous print in the series is \\"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\\" (神奈川沖浪裏, Kanagawa-oki Nami-ura). It illustrates a colossal wave towering over boats with Mount Fuji visible in the background. The dramatic composition and striking use of color in this particular piece have contributed to its enduring popularity and iconic status. Other notable prints in the series include \\"Rainstorm Beneath the Summit\\" (山下白雨, Sanka Hakuu), which captures a torrential downpour near Mount Fuji, and \\"Fine Wind, Clear Morning\\" (凱風快晴, Gaifū Kaisei), where the mountain is portrayed with a vivid red hue against a clear blue sky. Each print in the series offers a unique and captivating representation of Mount Fuji and its surrounding landscapes. In addition to the original 36 prints, Hokusai later created 10 more, bringing the total number to 46. The popularity of the \\"Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji\\" series expanded beyond Japan's borders, impacting artists around the globe. The series remains an exemplar of Japanese art, loved by both art aficionados and casual observers, and has solidified Hokusai's status as a paramount figure in the art world."},{"instruction":"Victorian Liberal candidate's car hit by ambulance The campaign for one Liberal candidate, contesting one of Victoria’s most marginal seats, almost crashed to a halt yesterday after his car was reportedly hit by an ambulance.

Once your batter is ready, let it sit while you preheat your non-stick skillet over medium heat. The secret of getting fluffy pancakes is letting the batter rest for about 10-15 minutes. This allows the flour to absorb the liquid and the baking powder to start working, making your pancakes even lighter and fluffier. To cook the pancakes, apply a small amount of butter or non-stick spray to your preheated skillet. For each pancake, scoop about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet. It’s essential to not overcrowd the pan, give each pancake enough room to spread out. Wait for bubbles to appear on the surface of the pancake, which usually takes about 2-3 minutes, this is the primary indicator that the bottom is thoroughly cooked and it is ready to be flipped. Use a flat spatula to flip the pancake gently, and cook the other side until golden brown, which typically takes another 1-2 minutes. Repeat this process until all your batter is used, adding more butter or spray as needed. Finally, serve your quick and easy pancakes while they are warm. You can top them with your favorite toppings such as syrup, fresh fruits, nut butters, or whipped cream for an added deliciousness. Remember a hot pancake will melt butter and absorb syrup much better, which makes for a better tasting pancake. Making pancakes can be as simple as mixing together a few ingredients that you likely already have in your kitchen. While the recipe is simple, the keys to perfect pancakes are a smooth but not over-mixed batter, a preheated and well-greased skillet, patience to wait for the right moment to flip each pancake, and immediate serving for the best taste and texture. Enjoy your pancake making process and have fun experimenting with different toppings, and you'll have the perfect breakfast or brunch treat for your family and friends. Enjoy your homemade fast and easy pancakes!"},{"instruction":"In this task you're given a question and you have to paraphrase the question to create the output question while retaining the meaning of the original question.

Non-reversible and reversible temperature labels are two different types of temperature indicators used for monitoring and measuring temperature changes. The primary difference between them lies in their ability to indicate temperature changes and whether they can return to their original state once the temperature has reached a certain level. Non-Reversible Temperature Labels: Non-reversible temperature labels, also known as irreversible temperature labels, are designed to provide a permanent record of temperature changes. These labels feature a temperature-sensitive material that changes color or shape when exposed to a specific temperature threshold, usually in the form of a stripe, dot, or other visual indicator. Once the temperature-sensitive material has undergone a change, it is unable to return to its original state. This makes non-reversible temperature labels particularly useful in situations where a record of temperature peaks is needed, such as ensuring that a material or product has been exposed to high temperatures during sterilization or heat treatment, or to monitor cold chain conditions for perishable goods. Advantages of Non-Reversible Temperature Labels: 1. Permanent record: Provides a clear and lasting indication of temperature changes, which is helpful for quality control and compliance purposes. 2. Wide temperature range: Non-reversible labels can be designed for various temperature thresholds, making them suitable for a range of applications. 3. Ease of use: The simplicity and visual nature of the labels make them easy to read and interpret. Reversible Temperature Labels: Reversible temperature labels, on the other hand, are designed to change their appearance or characteristics in response to temperature fluctuations and then return to their original state once the temperature returns to its initial level. These labels are typically made using materials such as liquid crystals or other thermochromic substances. The reversible nature of these temperature labels allows them to be used in applications where continuous monitoring and real-time feedback of temperature changes are essential. They can be particularly helpful for monitoring temperature fluctuations in equipment, products, or environments, where maintaining a consistent temperature is crucial for performance, safety, or product quality. Advantages of Reversible Temperature Labels: 1. Reusability: Their ability to return to their original state after a temperature change makes them cost-effective for long-term or continuous monitoring applications. 2. Real-time monitoring: Provides instant feedback on temperature fluctuations, allowing for quick adjustments to be made if necessary. 3. Customizable: Can be designed with a precision temperature range to suit specific applications and industries. In summary, the key differences between non-reversible and reversible temperature labels are their response to temperature changes and their ability to either permanently record or continually monitor temperature fluctuations. Non-reversible temperature labels provide a lasting indication of temperature peaks, making them ideal for situations where a permanent temperature record is needed. Reversible temperature labels, however, offer continuous monitoring and real-time feedback on temperature changes, making them suitable for applications where maintaining consistent temperatures is critical."},{"instruction":"This article: Romance was released internationally on 19 November 1991, and sold over 400,000 copies in its first 10 days.

Tell the person to stop contacting you. Voice your boundaries with someone you'll see often. Stop answering the person's calls, emails, and other messages. Remove the person from your phone and social media accounts.\\"","output":"Title: Establishing Boundaries: How to Tackle Unhealthy Relationships and Protect Your Well-Being Introduction Personal boundaries are crucial for maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle. It's essential to be able to voice one's boundaries and convey them with confidence. However, naming and addressing unhealthy behaviors can be challenging, especially in recurring relationships. This article aims to discuss ways to identify and address inappropriate behavior, establish boundaries in the process, and protect one's well-being in various situations. Identifying the Behavior & Acknowledging Its Inappropriateness The first step in establishing boundaries is to identify the behavior that is causing discomfort. Unhealthy behaviors can take multiple forms such as jealousy, manipulation, guilt-tripping, constant criticism, or controlling behavior. Acknowledging that this behavior is wrong and has a negative impact on your life is essential in building the confidence needed to address the situation. This realization often leads to feeling empowered and ready to set personal boundaries. Asking the Person to Stop Contacting You If the person's behavior is aggressive or you find yourself continuously hurt by their actions, it's essential to make a firm, clear, and direct request for them to stop contacting you. State clearly that you will no longer tolerate the distressing behavior and demand that they cease any form of communication. Be assertive, yet respectful, as it not only displays your determination to protect yourself but also ensures that you maintain the moral high ground. Voicing Your Boundaries with Someone You'll See Often When dealing with someone you'll regularly encounter, such as a coworker, family member, or neighbor, the situation can be more delicate. In these cases, establishing a dialogue to voice concerns and set healthy boundaries is key. Adopt a non-judgmental, calm, and assertive tone while explaining how the person's behavior is impacting you. Set limits on what you consider acceptable behaviors and the consequences should these boundaries be violated. Asserting oneself can lead to a better understanding and subsequently, a healthier relationship. Stop Answering the Person's Calls, Emails, and Other Messages Once the boundaries have been established, it's crucial to maintain firmness and consistency. Ignoring the individual's calls, texts, emails, and other messages can be an effective way to nullify the negative impact of unwanted communication. By doing so, you are taking control of the situation and signaling the importance of respecting your boundaries. Moreover, this enables you to distance yourself from the unhealthy relationship and focus on your well-being. Removing the Person from Your Phone and Social Media Accounts In today's world, virtual connections and social media play a significant role in maintaining relationships. Blocking or unfriending the person from social media platforms can serve as a concrete step in reinforcing the established boundaries. It not only cuts off a platform for their negative behavior but also allows you to recover from the stress and move on with your life. By removing their presence from your daily routine, you also create room for positive relationships and self-growth. Conclusion: Asserting personal boundaries protects your well-being, reinforces your self-worth, and sets the stage for developing healthier relationships. Keep in mind that you have the right to distance yourself from anyone causing you distress, regardless of their relation to you. By identifying inappropriate behavior, asking the person to stop contacting you, voicing your boundaries with someone you'll see often, and ultimately cutting off all forms of communication, you can regain control over your life and ensure your relationships are fostering support and growth."},{"instruction":"How does the next paragraph end?

It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto. - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country. - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus. - The President of the United States (POTUS) is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The Barack Obama Academy of International Studies , also known as Pittsburgh Obama 6 - 12 , is a public school in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .

The capital and largest city is Charleston. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.

Sandford? Suggested answer: Chief Justice Roger Taney , writing for the court, held that Scott, as a person of African ancestry, was not a citizen of the United States and therefore had no right to sue in federal court. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, you should validate this answer as it correctly identifies the central determination made by the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott v. Sandford case. However, it could be expanded upon to give a more detailed analysis of the ruling and its significance. Dred Scott v. Sandford, a case decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1857, was a landmark decision that had a profound impact on the course of American history. The ruling intensified the tensions between the North and South, fueling the debate over slavery, and indirectly contributed to the outbreak of the Civil War. The case involved Dred Scott, a slave who had been taken by his owner from Missouri, a slave state, to Illinois, a free state, and the Wisconsin Territory, a free territory. Scott subsequently claimed that he was entitled to freedom because he had lived in a free state and territory. After years of litigation, the case finally reached the Supreme Court. In a 7-2 decision, the Court ruled against Scott. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney delivered the majority opinion, which can be summarized in two main points: 1. Lack of Citizenship: Taney argued that African Americans, whether free or enslaved, could not be considered American citizens. He concluded that at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, they were \\"regarded as beings of an inferior order\\" and were \\"altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations.\\" As a result, Scott had no right to bring a lawsuit in federal court. 2. The Missouri Compromise: Taney asserted that the Missouri Compromise, a law that limited the expansion of slavery, was unconstitutional. He reasoned that because slaves were considered property under the Constitution, slave owners should be allowed to take their property wherever they pleased, including into territories where slavery was prohibited. The Dred Scott decision caused outrage among abolitionists and deepened the sectional divide in the United States. It discredited the idea of political compromise on the issue of slavery and contributed to the deteriorating relations between the North and South. In conclusion, the suggested answer is accurate in identifying the core issue in the Dred Scott v. Sandford case: Scott's lack of citizenship due to his African ancestry and his consequent inability to sue in federal court. By considering the additional information provided, you will have a better understanding of the full implications and historical significance of the Supreme Court's ruling."},{"instruction":"Charlie Bell became chief executive of McDonald's in April. Within a month doctors told him that he had color1ectal cancer. After stock market hours on November 22nd, the fast-food firm said he had resigned; it would need a third boss in under a year. Yet when the market opened, its share price barely dipped then edged higher. After all, McDonald's had, again, shown how to act swiftly and decisively in appointing a new boss. Mr. Bell himself got the top job when Jim Cantalupo died of a heart attack hours before he was due to address a convention of McDonald's franchisees . Mr. Cantalupo was a McDonald's veteran brought out of retirement in January 2003 to help remodel the firm after sales began falling because of dirty restaurants, indifferent service and growing concern about junk food. He devised a recovery plan, backed by massive marketing, and promoted Mr. Bell to chief operating officer. When Mr. Cantalupo died, a rapidly convened board confirmed Mr. Bell, a 44-year-old Australian already widely seen as his heir apparent, in the top job. The convention got its promised chief executive's address, from the firm's first non-American leader. Yet within weeks executives had to think about what to do if Mr. Bell became too ill to continue. Perhaps Mr. Bell had the same thing on his mind: he usually introduced Jim Skinner, the 60-year-old vice-chairman, to visitors as the \\"steady hand at the wheel\\". Now Mr. Skinner, an expert on the firm's overseas operations, becomes chief executive, and Mike Roberts, head of its American operations, joins the board as chief operating officer. Is Mr. Roberts now the new heir apparent? Maybe. McDonald's has brought in supposedly healthier choices such as salads and toasted sandwiches worldwide and, instead of relying for most of its growth on opening new restaurants, has turned to upgrading its 31,000 existing ones. America has done best at this; under Mr. Roberts, like-for-like sales there were up by 7. 5% in October on a year earlier. The new team's task is to keep the revitalization plan on course, especially overseas, where some American brands are said to face political hostility from consumers. This is a big challenge. Is an in-house succession(, ) the best way to tackle it? Mr. Skinner and Mr. Roberts are both company veterans, having joined in the 1970s. Some recent academic studies find that the planned succession of a new boss from within, such as Mr. Bell and now (arguably) Mr. Roberts, produces better results than looking hastily, or outside, for one. McDonald's smooth handling of its serial misfortunes at the top certainly seems to prove the point. Even so, everyone at McDonald's must be hoping that it will be a long time before the firm faces yet another such emergency. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. What fast food chain is the article in reference to? 2. Who are veterans of the company? 3. Who was the first non american CEO? 4. Who died while being CEO? 5. and his successor was? 6.

Everyone who works here is great too-- knowledgable, friendly, & fast baristas. Great environment. The shop is decorated w/ vintage matador/spanish bullfighting posters and old italian renaissance paintings. Great music always on their soundsystem -always changes depending on the barista - but it usually varies between, jazz (big band, crooners, beebop), underground garage rock, indie, electronica & downtempo, 90s and new wave. Cool, friendly diverse crowd always here-- families, college kids, hipsters, business ppl laptopping, artists, people on dates, etc. The evenings here are great too. They transform the space into a wine cafe w/ \\"afterhours\\" specialty coffee drinks (like the Mafia Hit - scotch & amaretto in a cappucino) + an evening menu of various apps and hummus platters. They dim the lights and all the tables are candlelit, btw. Makes for a nice vibe- think old italian cafe. Great spot for the wife & I to bike/beachcruise to and grab a glass of wine in the evenings.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

Movie title: The King Movie plot: The city of Kozhikode is victimized by a massive communal riot against the slums, costing the lives of 12 people. Madhu Kumar (Appa Haja), a wildlife photographer, had witnessed a group of criminals transporting explosives through the local forest check post, so he calls up the local police commissioner Shankar (Devan) and passes the information. Shankar asks him to wait for his officers to pick him up. But instead of the police, it was the same goons who came for Madhu, resulting in his death. While having the police to fight against the rioters, the aggressive and belligerent, yet honorable and incorruptible district collector Joseph Alex IAS (Mammootty) is suspicious of Shankar's activities and decides to investigate the case. He is assisted by ASP Prasad (Ganeshan), one of the sincere officers who admires Joseph for his arrogant way of dealing politicians and officials. Also tagging along with Alex is the young assistant district collector Anuradha Mukerji IAS (Vani Viswanath), whose freecare style conflicts against Alex's strict behavior because of her tragic childhood. It later turns out that Anura's behavior was rooted from a horrible experience of when her father continuously cheated on her mother a lot, and that her mother prayed to her to no avail, which is why Anura pretended to be a freak to ease her pain. Upon learning this, Alex decides to warm up to her. The next day, Alex is brought over to a personal hearing with the state minister John Vargeese (Kollam Thulasi), who berates him over his behavior while attempting to stop the riots. However, Alex stands up by berating Varghese for his belief to using his power to hurt others. Meanwhile, Madhu's father (Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair) reaches out to Prasad for filing a man missing complaint, resulting Prasad in discovering the body of Madhu in a decomposed stage with his camera, but the film is missing. As the investigation heats up, the local Member of Parliament Jayakrishnan (Murali) is struggling over the issues over the damaged area. However,... Answer:","output":"The leader behind the massacre of Madhu in the movie titled \\"The King\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the plot provided. However, it can be inferred that there are several characters who could potentially have a hand in Madhu's death directly or indirectly. These characters include: 1. Police Commissioner Shankar (Devan): Shankar is the main suspect in orchestrating the massacre since he was the one Madhu had contacted after witnessing criminals transporting explosives. Instead of sending his officers to pick up Madhu as promised, the same goons involved in the crime showed up, leading to Madhu's death. This indicates a high possibility that Shankar is involved in the entire ordeal, or at least in leaking the information about Madhu to the criminals. 2. State Minister John Vargeese (Kollam Thulasi): John Vargeese is an influential political figure who may have been involved in the communal riots and the transport of explosives. He could be directly or indirectly involved with the individuals responsible for the massacre. His confrontation with District Collector Joseph Alex IAS (Mammootty) displays his resentment towards Alex's attempt to fight against the riots, potentially revealing his involvement in the chaos. 3. Local Member of Parliament Jayakrishnan (Murali): Jayakrishnan is another politician who may have some connection with either the riots or the individuals who caused Madhu's death. His struggle with addressing the aftermath of the damaged area could hint at his unwillingness to take full responsibility or could be a cover-up for his potential connections with the criminals. 4. Criminals transporting explosives: The actual goons who killed Madhu while transporting the explosives are the direct culprits behind Madhu's death. However, they might have been acting upon the orders from a higher authority, which could be one of the mentioned characters above or someone else not explicitly mentioned in the provided plot. To sum up, it is not explicitly clear who is the leader behind the massacre of Madhu in \\"The King,\\" but the characters listed above may have connections or several levels of involvement leading up to his death. Further investigation and watching the movie are necessary to conclusively identify the mastermind behind this tragedy."},{"instruction":"Data: name = Blue Spice, priceRange = £20-25, area = riverside.

No Andrea Leadsom. Theresa was sticking to her plan of making herself invisible and waiting for her opponents to spontaneously self-combust. Andrea was back home in Northamptonshire reinforcing her stake in Britain’s future by cooking her children breakfast. So it was left to friends of Theresa and Andrea to champion their candidates in the Tory leadership race on the Marr and Peston shows. Andrea struggled from the off. If just being herself wasn’t a big enough handicap to her own ambitions, having the support of the Tory MP, Tim “Not Even Nice But Still Dim” Loughton and Arron Banks – a man whose sole claim to political legitimacy is being so loaded he has been able to shovel huge amounts of cash towards Nigel Farage and Ukip over the years – on Marr should have sent Andrea into a cold sweat. Loughton just looked miserable as he went through the motions of defending Leadsom’s comments on motherhood, while Banks all but announced plans to merge Ukip with the right wing of the Tory party to create a Thousand Year Nasty Party. Over on Peston, there was Iain Duncan Smith, a man whose credibility has now sunk so low that he was captioned as “Andrea Leadsom Fan” rather than “The Idiot who Introduced Universal Credit while Work and Pensions Secretary”. There was a lot of coughing and far too much sweat and sheen. “I’m not saying Andrea – ahem – was stitched up by the Times as – ahem – unfortunately the interviewer had recorded the conversation,” he spluttered, “but she was – ahem – definitely stitched up. In any case, you – ahem – don’t need shedloads of experience – ahem – to be prime minister.” IDS seems to have forgotten that the Conservatives took rather a different view when they ousted him as their leader in 2003 after two traumatic years of feeble opposition. Ahem. No such proxy warfare for the Labour party, as Jeremy Corbyn and Angela Eagle went head-to-head on the rival channels. Eagle has been promising to launch a leadership bid “in the next 24 hours” for the past 10 days, but on Peston she was keen to announce that she would definitely be putting herself forward for the Labour leadership the very next day. She didn’t look exactly overjoyed by the challenge; her anxiety as much a product of the bruising conflict ahead as her own relative inexperience on the Sunday politics chat shows. Eagle’s main pitch was that she wasn’t Corbyn. She didn’t mention a single policy as for the time being she didn’t think the party had need of them. Policies were for when the party had a leader who was in a position to oppose. “Jeremy isn’t a bad man,” she said through gritted teeth. Her expression suggested there was a fine line between bad and stubborn which Jeremy was dangerously close to crossing. “He’s just not a leader. This isn’t about splitting the Labour party; it’s about uniting it.” Not if Corbyn has a say in things. An angry, ranting Corbyn is a fairly harmless creature; a smiling, passive-aggressive Corbyn is a much scarier prospect. This was a Corbyn for post-post-truth politics. A Corbyn that would have been a match for George Smiley. “I think the Labour party is going places,” he said. “We’re doing very well.” That was well, as in failing to get out the Labour vote during the referendum “I worked flat out it’s just that I did it very quietly”; well, as in having a Labour leader who doesn’t have the confidence of more than 80% of his own MPs; well, as in a Labour party that has been unable to capitalise on the Tory Brexit meltdown. Marr missed a trick by not asking him what Labour doing badly would look like. Marr did ask Corbyn about his own rather chequered track record of disloyalty to Labour leaders – it’s hard to find one he has ever supported – but he was adamant that that was then and this was now. Things feel a bit different when you’re not the instigator. Besides, Corbyn had only ever treached on matters of principle. Listen carefully and you could hear the sound of one hair splitting. The more he was pressed, the icier he became. No, he wouldn’t stand aside. Yes, he would mount a legal challenge if Labour’s national executive committee said he couldn’t be on the ballot without the support of 51 MPs. He would not weaken his grip on power. It was almost as if he wanted a fight. He had the support of a few hundred thousand Labour members and the revolution started there. So what if Labour lost an election or three. Far better to have 100 of the right kind of MPs than 330 who could form a government. It was all turning into a Bad D:Ream. Things can only get messier. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article focuses on various politicians championing Andrea Leadsom and Theresa May in the Tory leadership race on television shows, while criticizing Leadsom's lack of experience and discussing the support she has garnered. The Labour Party's political conflict between Jeremy Corbyn and Angela Eagle is also highlighted as they face off on rival Sunday political programs. Eagle's main pitch lies in her not being Corbyn, focusing on the need for a leader to unite the party, whereas, Corbyn portrays the Labour Party in a positive light, despite internal controversies, and is determined not to step down or weaken his grip on power."},{"instruction":"What is the answer to this question? lord of the rings return of the king extended run time?","output":"Hey little buddy!

By Sally Lee A Chinese-born Australian artist has reportedly been arrested in China following his recent media interview about the student-led protest and military crackdown in June 1989, also known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Although Australian authorities are yet to confirm whether Guo Jian has been detained by police, it is believed the 52-year-old made contact with friends via text message to inform them that he'd been taken from his home in eastern Beijing on Sunday night. The former soldier has also caused a stir with his latest art work - a diorama of Tiananmen Square covered in 160kg of minced pork. After a stint as a soldier, Guo was studying art in","output":"China when the Tiananmen Square protests erupted. Shocked by the violence and the military crackdown, he became deeply moved and inspired by the bravery of the students who were rallying for democracy. The events of June 1989 had a profound impact on his art, shaping his creative vision and cementing his commitment to speaking out against injustice. Guo eventually moved to Australia in the 1990s, where he pursued a successful career as an artist, using his work as a platform to raise awareness about human rights violations and the suppression of free speech, particularly in his native country. He never shied away from addressing controversial issues, as evidenced by his provocative art pieces focusing on the harrowing events of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. When Guo returned to China in 2005, he continued producing and displaying thought-provoking artwork that criticized the government's heavy-handed approach to dissent. Despite the risks involved, Guo's courage and determination to expose the truth remained unwavering. His arrest following the recent media interview underscores the Chinese government's ongoing efforts to suppress any discussion or mention of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, which still remains a taboo subject in China. It is a sharp reminder that freedom of expression is far from being fully realized in the country, with artists like Guo Jian, who dare to speak out through their work, often facing dire consequences. As the world watches in concern, calls for Guo's release from detention and greater artistic freedom in China are gaining momentum. It is hoped that international pressure will ultimately lead to greater transparency and respect for human rights within the nation. In the meantime, the inspiring and courageous legacy of Guo's art continues to serve as a powerful reminder that the struggle for democracy and justice has not been in vain."},{"instruction":"It was hot. The smell of blood already hung heavy in the air. The white sands, imported from the far west mountains of limestone, sucked up the fire of the huge red sun. It was always hot in the south desert. Even in the deep of night the stones of Gazu Kadem kept the city warm. Now, at mid-day, it was at its hottest. A quarter of a million people at the arena didn't make it any cooler. The merchants, nobles, and the slaves lucky enough to attend had waited outside Dan Trex's arena for days. They knew the value of entertainment in such a dark world. They wore cowls to protect themselves from the sun as they waited. Entire businesses thrived on the forced mercantile of the captive audience. Food went for thrice its cost to those waiting near the entrance. Water went for five times as much. The arena was as old as the city, built in the days of the old empire for a king now long forgotten. The octagonal arena was a machine, an engine that built warriors out of the raw material of flesh, blood, and steel. Now, thousands of years later, it still served that purpose. The machine had built Dan Trex's army, half a million of the most ruthless and well trained soldiers to ever walk the planet. While one hundred and fifty thousand civilians and slaves got drunk, gambled, shat, fucked, and slept on the stone steps; one hundred thousand of his men sat in silence wearing black and bronze and watching him as Trex walked out into the arena alone and unhelmed. His soldiers watched the games in silence. They made not a sound when twelve of the most beautiful girls to walk on small bare feet were raped and flayed apart by dark priests in a ritual to Gazu Kadem's god-king, Danken Ovelde. They studied the three-horned desert bull as it gored five slaves. They watched the spear technique of four slave armies as they warred in a single great battle.

Passage:Ain't She Sweet was an American album featuring four tracks recorded in Hamburg in 1961 by The Beatles featuring Tony Sheridan (except for the title song with vocal by John Lennon) and cover versions of Beatles and British Invasion-era songs recorded by the Swallows. As Atlantic Records only had rights to four Sheridan/Beatle recordings recorded by Polydor Records, they filled the rest of the album with Beatle and British Invasion cover songs. When this material was released by Atco Records, there were mono (catalogue number 33-169) and stereo (SD 33-169) editions. Atco also added additional drum overdubs to the four Sheridan cuts on top of the original drum tracks. American drummer Bernard Purdie claims to have performed overdubs of unspecified Beatles records, which would most likely have been for Ain't She Sweet, but this has never been officially confirmed.

She's only trying to help, and if she wants to talk to you, take the time to listen. Respond to what she's saying and take the time to think about it. You can even reassure her that such an incident will not repeat at the end of your talk, so she knows you thought about it and your apology is genuine. When you do answer her questions, don't get an attitude about it. Just answer calmly, directly, and truthfully. For instance, if your mom says, \\"What were you thinking?\\" don't say, \\"I don't know, obviously I'm an idiot\\" in a sarcastic tone. Try something more along the lines of \\"I guess I wasn't thinking very clearly. I'll try to do better next time.\\" Doing so will show her you respect her decision. Your mom isn't yelling at you because she dislikes you or hates you. She cares about you, and she doesn't want you making bad choices which will have an impact on your future. She wants you to be safe and learn to be a better person. Don't be mean, or fling hateful insults. Don't stomp or slam doors. You'll only make her angrier, and later, you'll be sad you acted that way. In addition, your mom will respect your maturity and may forgive you faster. If she says, \\"You always say that and don't follow through!\\" don't argue. Say you understand, and ask for her help in trying to do better in the future.

Avoid behaving aggressively or using hurtful language, as this will only escalate the situation. Show maturity by acknowledging any patterns of past behavior, understanding her perspective, and seeking her help to improve in the future. This approach will not only foster a stronger and more respectful relationship with your mother, but it may also lead to quicker forgiveness and a greater willingness to help you grow and learn."},{"instruction":"Summarize: Police said they were called to reports of a body at a property in Templehill in Troon at 17:15 BST on Saturday.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Q: Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : So my 4 friends and I were planning a multi-country trip to Europe for 2 weeks in June. I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to sign up for the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card for the sign up bonus since well have plenty of time before we actually go on our trip. The signup bonus is if you spend 4,000 in the first 3 months and receive 50,000 pts which is roughly 500-625. They kind of shrugged it off like it was nothing and I ended up being the only one that signed up and was planning on buying visa gift cards over the span of the next 3 months to hit 4,000 spent. But instead we used my new credit card to pay for the plane tickets since we bought it as a bundle of 5 and it came out to 3942. So basically i hit my mark. Then the next day we were talking about the trip and one of my friends said oh we can use the points you got towards all our train tickets and my other friends agreed. Then I said no because those are my points. I told them from the beginning they could sign up for this deal and they all just ignored me. Then they said how I was shady and greedy for not wanting to share the travel points and that it's because of their collective effort that I was able to obtain the points in the first place. But I mentioned that I could've just bought visa gift cards which was my original plan and they just kept saying that I was sketchy. Then one of them said if you're really going to be this greedy then just refund the tickets and I'll buy mine on my own. So I refunded the tickets and decided that I didn't want to spend 2 weeks in a foreign country with these guys if they were really going to be this petty. A:","output":"In this situation, it is not entirely clear-cut whether the author, nobody, everybody, or other is wrong, as it depends on individual perspectives on the ethical aspects of the situation. However, I will attempt to analyze the situation and provide a yes or no answer for each party involved. 1. AUTHOR: Is the author wrong? NO. The author shared the information about the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card and its sign-up bonus with their friends. The author's friends chose not to participate in the deal. It is understandable that the author would want to use the points they earned individually for their own expenses. The author's original plan was to buy visa gift cards to reach the 4,000 spending requirement, so their friends' involvement is not vital for them to obtain the bonus points. 2. NOBODY: Is no one in the situation wrong? NO. While there may be a lack of clear communication and understanding between the friends, this does not necessarily mean that nobody is wrong in the situation. Both the author and their friends could have handled the situation better, so it is not accurate to say that nobody is wrong. 3. EVERYBODY: Is everyone in the situation wrong? YES. All parties involved could be considered to have some level of fault. The author's friends could have been more open to considering the credit card deal provided by the author. However, the author could have also been more explicit in stating up front that the points earned from booking the tickets would not be shared. The situation may have been resolved differently if communication was clearer from all parties. 4. OTHER: Is someone other than the author or their friends wrong in the situation? NO.

Forces also kidnapped, tortured and killed dozens of young men, it said. Meanwhile, a court has sentenced four generals to life in jail for their part in trying to overthrow President Pierre Nkurunziza in May last year. Nine other officers were jailed for 30 years and eight soldiers, including drivers and body guards, to five years for their role in the unrest sparked by Mr Nkurunziza's announcement that he would run for a third term. He secured a third term in disputed elections in July. The abuses documented by the UN took place immediately after rebel attacks in December against three military camps in the country's capital, Bujumbura, the UN's human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, said in a statement. The UN believes the army is taking revenge for the attacks. Mr Hussein also called for an investigation into reports that nine mass graves were found in and around Bujumbura, warning about the \\"increasing ethnic dimension of the crisis\\". Some witnesses say that violence from security forces was directed at the Tutsi minority. Burundi has been plagued by tension between Tutsis and Hutus since independence in 1962. However, analysts say ethnicity is not at the heart of the conflict. The failed coup leader, ex-General Godefroid Niyombare, who is on the run, is a Hutu. His allies sentenced to life in jail by the Supreme Court were a mix of ethnicities. Gen Cyrille Ndayirukiye, the former defence minister, and Hermenegilde Nimenya, a police general, are Tutsis and army generals Zenon Ndabaneze and Juvenal Niyungeko are Hutu.

Some people got less punishments for the problems they caused. The president had already been in his job two times and wanted a third time, which caused some fights. The UN people noticed that these bad things happened after bad rebels attacked some parts of the country and the people in charge felt angry. The UN guy also asked for people to look into secret places where many people might be buried, and how this might be about different groups of people fighting each other. In Burundi, two main groups of people called Tutsis and Hutus sometimes have fights since a long time ago. The big person in charge who didn't like the president was also from one of these groups, Hutus, and had friends from both groups.

It consists of cells, and the cell walls are composed of micro-fibrils of cellulose (40% – 50%) and hemicellulose (15% – 25%) impregnated with lignin (15% – 30%).\\" Answer:","output":"Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are all components found in wood. They are part of the cell walls of wood cells. Cellulose makes up about 40%-50% of the wood's composition. It is a complex carbohydrate or polysaccharide which gives the wood its strength and rigidity. It is made up of thousands of glucose units linked together to form a long chain. Hemicellulose comprises about 15%-25% of the wood. Unlike cellulose which is made up of just one type of sugar (glucose), hemicellulose is made up of various types of sugars. Its structure is not as ordered as cellulose, and it doesn't provide as much strength. Instead, hemicellulose is responsible for helping to bind the cellulose fibers together. Lignin accounts for about 15%-30% of the wood's composition and its primary role is to bind the cellulose fibers together, giving wood its overall structure and form. Additionally, lignin provides resistance to microbial attack and contributes to the dark color of the wood. In summary, wood is a complex material composed of cells with walls made up of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.

She drank coffee and smoked my father's cigarettes and paced between the sofa and the TV. Next morning she threatened to pack up and leave, so Dad drove to the store and hurried back. He sprayed poison from a jug. When he was finished he told us that was the end of it. For a couple of weeks we went back to find dead crickets in the laundry.

Then he burned a lot of old newspapers and magazines which he said the crickets had turned into nests. While we ate supper that evening, the wind lifted some flames onto the wood pile.

She is brought to New York by one of their butlers, where she moves in with a bunch of snobs. The upperclass people are not impressed with her, but Connie is able to befriend the servants. One afternoon, her cousin Barbara Clinton orders Connie to stop Ted Drake from going riding without her. Connie tries the best she can, which results in embarrassing herself. She has secretly fallen in love with him and is filled with joy when she learns the Drake family is organizing a ball. The servants raise money to buy her a fashionable dress. However, Barbara spreads a lie and Connie is eventually prohibited from attending the ball. Connie is heartbroken, until the servants arrange a limousine she can use until midnight. Meanwhile, the police detain the Clinton family car until almost midnight when they can be brought before a judge, since the chauffeur is missing the vehicle's proof of ownership. At the ball, everyone is impressed with her singing talents. Ted notices her and tries to charm her. They eventually kiss, when Connie realizes it is midnight. She runs off, but accidentally leaves one of her slippers behind. Ted finds the slipper and tries to locate the owner. Arriving at the ball just before midnight, Barbara spots Connie leaving the ball. Infuriated, she tries to break Connie's confidence and fires all the servants. The next day, Connie is missing as well, and her uncle James berates Grace, Barbara, and Walter for their hostile/indifferent attitude to Connie. Meanwhile, Connie returns to Miss Wiggins' school in the hope of becoming a music teacher. Ted follows her and they reunite in the end.
