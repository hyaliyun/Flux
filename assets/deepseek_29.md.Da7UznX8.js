It applied to a person involved in making or selling candles and similar articles. The earliest records as a surname are of Matthew le Candeler in London in 1274 and William le Chandeler in Essex in 1275. In the 1881 census of England, the surname Chandler was apparently used by over 0.3 % of the population. Where does the last name chandler come from? Let's have some stream of consciousness first.","output":"The last name Chandler has its origins in medieval England as an occupational surname. Let's go through the thought process systematically: 1. The name comes from the Old French word 'chandelier' or 'candeler', which means candle maker or candle seller. 2. It was brought to England by the Normans after the 1066 conquest and gradually adapted into the English language. 3. As an occupational surname, it denoted people who were involved in making or selling candles and similar articles, which were essential everyday items in medieval times. 4. The use of surnames began around the 11th and 12th centuries to distinguish people with the same given names. Chandler being an occupational surname indicates that the name was passed on through generations to the family members pursuing the same profession. 5. The earliest records of the Chandler surname are from the late 13th century; Matthew le Candeler in London in 1274 and William le Chandeler in Essex in 1275. 6. Over time, the surname has had multiple variations in spelling, which is common in surnames of that era due to the lack of standardized spelling rules. 7. In the 1881 census of England, the surname Chandler was found to be used by over 0.3% of the population, indicating the widespread adoption of the name. In conclusion, the last name 'Chandler' originates from medieval England as an occupational surname for candle makers or candle sellers, ultimately deriving from the Old French word 'chandelier' or 'candeler'. The earliest records of the name can be traced back to the late 13th century in London and Essex."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: DOHA | DOHA (Reuters) - Despite mounting alarm about climate change, almost 200 nations meeting in Doha from Monday are likely to pay little more than lip service to the need to rein in rising greenhouse gas emissions. A likely failure to agree a meaningful extension of the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol, a legally binding plan for cutting emissions by developed nations, would also undercut work on a new deal meant to unite rich and poor in fighting global warming from 2020. \\"The situation is very urgent ... We can no longer say that climate change is tomorrow's problem,\\" Andrew Steer, president of the Washington-based World Resources Institute think-tank, said of the November 26-December 7 talks in Qatar. Superstorm Sandy had been a wake-up call for many Americans as the sort of extreme event predicted by climate scientists in a warming world, he said, even though individual weather events cannot be blamed on man-made global warming. A U.N. study last week said the world was on target for a rise in temperatures of between 3 and 5 degrees Celsius (5.4 to 9F) because of increasing emissions. That would cause more floods, droughts, heatwaves and rising sea levels. A U.N. conference two years ago agreed to limit any rise in temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) above pre-industrial times. But greenhouse gas levels hit a new record in 2011, despite the world economic slowdown. And countries are showing little sign of raising ambition. \\"A faster response to climate change is necessary and possible,\\" Christiana Figueres, head of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat, said in a statement outlining hopes for the talks. \\"The climate talks so far have not produced anything like the results that the science tells us that we need,\\" said Samantha Smith, leader of global climate and energy work at the WWF conservation group. Delegates will meet in a cavernous conference center in Qatar - the first OPEC state to host the annual talks and the nation with the world's highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions, roughly three times those of the average American. KYOTO EXTENSION To keep up climate action, most countries favor extending the 1997 Kyoto pact, which binds developed nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions by an average 5.2 percent below 1990 levels between the years 2008 and 2012. But Russia, Japan and Canada have pulled out in recent years, meaning that Kyoto backers are down to a core led by the European Union and Australia that account for about 14 percent of world emissions. The defectors say it is meaningless to extend cuts under Kyoto when big emerging countries, led by China, India, Brazil and South Africa, have no curbs on rising emissions. The United States never ratified Kyoto, for similar reasons. Developing countries and Kyoto backers say it is vital that developed nations lead the way towards the new worldwide accord meant to be negotiated by the end of 2015 and to start up in 2020. Failure to extend Kyoto would leave only national actions, with no legally binding U.N. framework. \\"The Kyoto Protocol is going to be very important for us,\\" said Seyni Nafo, spokesman of the African group of nations. \\"And ambition is very low.\\" The EU and others agreed at last year's talks in Durban to extend Kyoto for a new period but details remain to be agreed, such as whether it should last five or eight years. The EU said it would not deepen its own goal at Doha, of a 20 percent cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020, to an alternative of a 30 percent cut if other rich nations also act. \\"We will ... keep the door open to go further, to 30 percent, even if that is not going to happen this year,\\" said EU Artur Runge-Metzger of the EU Commission. A study by the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development said on Monday that rich nations had fallen short on promises to give poor countries 30 billion in new aid to help them combat climate change from 2010 to 2012. It said commitments so far totaled just 23.6 billion, and most was in loans that would have to be repaid by the poor. Another study by international aid agency Oxfam also estimated that only 33 per cent of the \\"fast-start finance\\" promised at a Copenhagen summit in 2009 could be considered new. Rich nations have also promised aid totaling 100 billion a year by 2020, but did not make any clear pledges for 2013-2019. (Reporting by Alister Doyle; Editing by Myra MacDonald) ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| • Doha has a special place in the history of diplomacy. Talks started there in 2001 under the World Trade Organisation, aimed at solving trade barriers that penalise the poor. The Doha round dragged on to 2008 without conclusion and is now in limbo. Doha is a byword for stalemate and failure. So when the United Nations chose the Qatari capital as the location for this year's round of climate change talks, starting on Monday, there was a collective groan from greens. There is every prospect these negotiations will suffer the same fate. The history of climate talks is as unpromising as the location – this year, the negotiations \\"celebrated\\" their 20th birthday, but after all that talking there is still no global treaty stipulating cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, and the best governments are now hoping for is to draw up an agreement in the next three years that would not come into force until 2020. • This year marks the end of the first commitment period of the 1997 Kyoto protocol. But it was never ratified by the US, contains no obligations for developing countries and has been abandoned by others. Kyoto will limp on, as the EU and some developing countries want it, but without an effective new treaty there will be no global resolve to tackle emissions. Compared with the urgent warnings from scientists – that we are on the edge of a \\"climate cliff\\" and only urgent drastic emissions cuts will save us from a world of extreme weather – the less-than-snail's pace of these negotiations looks not just absurd but dangerous. In frustration, some have suggested scrapping the talks. But without them, what mechanism would there be to enjoin all countries, developed and developing, to take the action needed? The UN provides the only forum where all countries have an equal say. • The fortnight-long talks, which take place each year in the weeks leading up to Christmas, provide little in the way of spectacle, but sometimes stray into bad pantomime. Negotiators spend their days and long stretches of the night locked in technical discussions over such arcana as LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry, since you ask) and the CDM (clean development mechanism, a form of carbon trading). Adjusting the placement of a comma can take hours, and the texts are thick with square brackets, denoting all the terms that have not yet been settled. Only the presence of campaigning groups pulling stunts outside the halls – dressing as polar bears is a favourite, and every day the most recalcitrant negotiator is crowned \\"fossil of the day\\" – enlivens the proceedings. This year's accessory of choice looks to be the Homer Simpson mask, imploring governments not to put the \\"D'oh!\\" into Doha. (The jokes don't get any better as the talks drag on.) For the final three days, the ministers arrive and the real work begins. Last year, in Durban, the talks ran on past the final Friday night deadline, through Saturday and only finished as dawn broke on Sunday. All that achieved was an agreement to keep talking, setting a deadline of 2015 for drafting a potential treaty. • While the diplomats dither, time is running out. Global greenhouse gas emissions are still rising, having barely registered a blip from the financial crisis and recession. As a world, we are doing worse than ever on climate change, just when we need to be doing better – if emissions do not peak by 2020, scientists have warned, we may lose forever the chance to contain climate change to manageable levels. On current trends, the world is headed for 6C of warming, a level not seen for millions of years and that would cause chaos, according to the International Energy Agency. Fatih Birol, chief economist, says: \\"I don't see enough of a sense of urgency. We do not have time to waste. We need progress at these talks.\\" Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN environment programme, warns: \\"While governments work to negotiate a new international climate agreement, they urgently need to put their foot firmly on the action pedal.\\" • Every conference centre, every hotel the delegates will inhabit, every piece of modern infrastructure in the city of Doha has been built on its oil and gas wealth. This is the first time the talks have been held in an oil-rich Middle Eastern country, and the UN evidently hoped the choice of site would encourage countries that have long been among the most hostile to a climate agreement. Ironically, the Middle East is facing energy issues of its own. The IEA has just forecast that the US will be the world's biggest oil and gas producer within the decade, thanks to the bonanza of shale gas and oil. This will redraw the geopolitical power map, and the economics of energy, and should make for interesting chats among the US and Saudi delegations. • Barack Obama's re-election stands out as one bright spot. Although climate barely rated a mention during the campaign, even while superstorm Sandy raged, Obama will be looking to his legacy. This year's weather – Sandy, a drought in the US that pushed up food prices, disruption to the Indian monsoon, floods in Europe – was accompanied by some stark warnings. Satellite pictures showed melting across almost the entire Greenland ice sheet. The Arctic sea ice shrank to its lowest recorded extent. As negotiators gather in their air-conditioned conference rooms, they might want to spare a glance for the world outside. You can't put square brackets around the ice cap. |||||","output":"The annual United Nations climate change talks take place in Doha from November 26 to December 7, 2012.

The most notable example of this is the Bekir Pasha Aqueduct, built under the auspices of Ebubekir Pasha between 1746 and 1748. This aqueduct supplied fresh water to Larnaca and prior to its construction, local residents had to carry water on their backs for two hours. Silihtar aqueduct, built between 1801 and 1803, and the Arab Ahmet aqueduct supplied water to Nicosia. The authorities also encouraged the construction and improvement of artificial channels for water supply and irrigation, which greatly increased crop yield and allowed large-scale fruit production. Among villages described as prosperous due to artificial irrigation upon the British takeover of the island are Morphou, Lapithos, Polis, Lefka, Avdimou and Kolossi. Samuel Baker, who visited Cyprus in 1879, noted \\"mills turned by water\\" and \\"narrow lanes streaming with water\\" in Lefka. He also wrote that \\"every garden and farm was irrigated by water conducted from the mountains in artificial channels\\" in the northern slopes of the Kyrenia Mountains extending to the Karpas Peninsula. In Karavas, streams were diverted into artificial channels to supply water to the village. In the 19th century, a major effort was undertaken by a series of Ottoman governors to straighten and regulate the course of the Pedieos. Edhem Pasha, who served as governor in the 1840s, completed the construction of the Larnaca-Nicosia road and several bridges.

As the industry has grown and technology has advanced, the nature of these games has changed as well. Today's video games often involve complex narratives, problem-solving tasks, social interactions, and intricate virtual worlds that require players to engage with the game on various cognitive and emotional levels. Given the ubiquity of video games in modern culture and the numerous hours that children spend playing them, there has been a significant amount of research conducted to better understand the potential impacts of video games on children's cognitive development. Researchers are particularly interested in determining whether playing video games can promote cognitive skills such as attention, memory, problem-solving, and creativity, or if it can have negative effects such as decreased academic performance and attention problems. Hypothesis: Playing video games can enhance children's cognitive development According to this hypothesis, engaging in video games can lead to improvements in various cognitive skills in children. The proposed mechanism for this enhancement is that through playing video games, children are exposed to scenarios and situations that require them to use and develop a variety of cognitive abilities. For example, strategy and puzzle games may necessitate planning, problem-solving, and pattern recognition skills to succeed. Adventure games might involve memorizing maps, following multi-step instructions, or comprehending complex storylines that can bolster memory and reading comprehension. Multiplayer online games often demand effective communication and cooperation with teammates, thus enhancing social cognition and perspective-taking abilities. Moreover, several studies have hinted at possible positive correlations between video gaming and improvements in attention, mental flexibility, and even hand-eye coordination. Video games that involve quick reactions and changing stimuli may train players' ability to focus their attention, shift between tasks, and process information efficiently. Also, games that require precise control of a character or object might help improve hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. Based on this hypothesis, the key to reaping the cognitive benefits of video games could be moderation, balance, and selecting age-appropriate games that are stimulating and challenging but not excessively violent or unrealistic. Through this balance, children could successfully utilize video games as a tool for cognitive development, while also enjoying their entertainment value."},{"instruction":"he requested of the prussian ministry of culture that he be allowed to end lecturing at the military college. however he received no quick reply to his modest request so he wrote to göttingen accepting the offer of gauss 's chair.

However, he received no quick reply to his modest request, so he wrote to Göttingen accepting the offer of Gauss's chair. In the given passage, it can be observed that the protagonist wished to end his lecturing commitments at the Military College. His proposal was formally submitted to the Prussian Ministry of Culture, the governing body responsible for overseeing and managing educational and cultural matters in the region. Despite the protagonist's earnest and humble request, he did not receive a timely response from the authorities. This lack of communication led him to consider an alternative opportunity which had been presented before him -- the prestigious offer to occupy Gauss's chair at the esteemed University of Göttingen. Göttingen, a well-known German city, houses one of the oldest and most respected universities in the country. The offer to assume the position of Gauss's chair signifies a highly distinguished role for the protagonist, likely presenting an opportunity to contribute significantly to the academic community and ultimately furthering his own professional career. Gauss, a notable mathematician and scientist, held a prestigious position within the University of Göttingen, and his chair symbolizes his significant influence and legacy in the fields of mathematics, physics, and other related disciplines. Accepting the responsibility of Gauss's chair would be a great honor for the protagonist, allowing him to leave his current position and advance in his professional endeavors. In conclusion, the protagonist's desire to cease his lecturing duties at the Military College, coupled with the absence of a swift reply from the Prussian Ministry of Culture, led him to accept the esteemed offer of Gauss's chair at the University of Göttingen.

Aaliyah Dana Haughton (; January 16, 1979 – August 25, 2001) was an American singer, actress, and model. Born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Detroit, Michigan, she first gained recognition at the age of 10, when she appeared on the television show Star Search and performed in concert alongside Gladys Knight. At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with Jive Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson's Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to R. Kelly, who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing but a Number. The album sold 3 million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with Atlantic Records. Aaliyah worked with record producers Timbaland and Missy Elliott for her second album, One in a Million, which sold 3 million copies in the United States and more than 8 million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first film, Romeo Must Die. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single \\"Try Again\\". The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 solely on airplay, making Aaliyah the first artist in Billboard history to achieve this goal. \\"Try Again\\" also earned Aaliyah a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B Vocalist. After completing Romeo Must Die, Aaliyah filmed her role in Queen of the Damned, and released her self-titled third and final studio album in 2001. On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah and eight others were killed in a plane crash in the Bahamas after filming the music video for the single \\"Rock the Boat\\". The pilot, Luis Morales III, was unlicensed at the time of the accident and toxicology tests revealed that he had traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system. Aaliyah's family later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Blackhawk International Airways, which was settled out of court. Aaliyah's music continued to achieve commercial...

Clashes were still being reported in the northern outskirts of the city. Tal Afar, near the Syrian border, is one of the jihadists' last remaining strongholds in Iraq. Last month, a long-running operation drove IS militants from the Iraqi city of Mosul. Gen Yarallah, who is in charge the latest offensive, said his forces were now dealing with the final pockets of jihadi resistance in Tal Afar. Footage from within the city shows Iraqi forces moving through the streets in tanks with black smoke billowing from targeted buildings. \\"Tal Afar city is about to fall completely into the hands of our forces, only 5% remains [under IS control]\\", a military spokesman told Reuters news agency. Soldiers from the Shia-led paramilitary Popular Mobilisation (Hashd al-Shaabi) said they had encountered resistance from IS in the form of snipers, booby-trapped cars and mortars. Iraqi forces broke through IS defences to reach the centre of Tal Afar on Friday. Elite units had also seized the northern neighbourhoods of Nida, Taliaa, Uruba, Nasr and Saad, the Iraqi Joint Operations Command (JOC) said. It was believed about 2,000 militants had been inside Tal Afar, along with between 10,000 and 40,000 civilians. Tal Afar, which had a predominantly ethnic Turkmen population of 200,000 before it fell to IS in June 2014, sits on a major supply route between Mosul, about 55km (35 miles) to the east, and the Syrian border, 150km (90 miles) to the west. Security sources say a disproportionate number of men from the city filled the ranks of IS as commanders, judges and members of their religious police. The city was cut off during the nine-month Mosul offensive by troops and allied militiamen from the Hashd al-Shaabi. But they did not attempt to retake it until this week. More than 30,000 civilians have fled the Tal Afar area since the end of April, many of them arriving at Iraqi government mustering points exhausted and dehydrated after trekking for 10 to 20 hours in extreme heat, the UN said. This article was about:","output":"This article is about a situation in a place called Tal Afar in Iraq where good soldiers have been fighting against bad militants, like getting rid of naughty bullies.

When you color a picture, you can easily tell one color from another. Sometimes, though, a color might look like it fits with the others, but it's still a little bit different. This is like what's happening with Naglaa Ali Mahmoud, who is going to be the next First Lady of Egypt. Egypt is a country in Africa, famous for things like the great pyramids and ancient history. Being a First Lady is important because it's the wife of the president - she usually helps with things like running events and charities. Naglaa Ali Mahmoud is going to be in charge of some of these things soon, as her husband, Mohamed Morsi, is going to be the next president of Egypt. But, what's interesting is that Naglaa Ali Mahmoud looks and acts like many other people in Egypt. She doesn't wear fancy clothes or have a lot of money. This is what's making people talk about her. Many people like that she is just like them, and they feel comfortable with her. They think she will be able to understand their needs and be a really good First Lady. On the other hand, some people think that Naglaa Ali Mahmoud should be more like the \\"traditional\\" First Ladies. They would like her to wear fancy clothes, speak very politely, and be more like a queen. They are worried that if she doesn't act this way, people won't respect her or the president. This conversation is like a game of tug-of-war, with people pulling on both sides of the argument. No matter what side you are on, it shows that many people care about what the First Lady of Egypt is like. We'll just have to wait and see how things go once Naglaa Ali Mahmoud starts her new job."},{"instruction":"Indian Relay might just be America's best-kept sporting secret. Little-known outside the tribes of the Rocky Mountains in the northwest, it's a \\"magical\\" mix of horse racing, track-and-field relay and the all-action adrenalin of rodeo. Each race is battled out by up to six jockeys over three laps of a track -- and the riders have to change horses every lap. With handlers for each horse, it creates a melee of 18 horses and 24 people. It is pure, unadulterated and unpredictable chaos. To add a further twist, they don't use saddles or helmets, and the danger element adds to the \\"rock star\\" esteem in which the jockeys are held by their communities. Kendall Old Horn has been involved in the sport for 37 years -- first as a rider back in 1978 and now as a team owner after returning after 21 years away, following a five-year stint in the Marine Corps. \\"I don't know how to sell the sport but what I do know is that it's a fast-paced, high-action sport,\\" he explains. \\"The adrenalin rush is the biggest buzz you can imagine. \\"You can't beat that feeling, there's nothing like it. It's better than any high that you can experience, if you'd done anything like that. For me, it's America's best-kept secret as a sport.\\" Horses are a way of life for the Native American tribes of Montana, where Old Horn is based. \\"I've been around horses from the day I hit the ground,\\" he says. Horses are very therapeutic. They take away the everyday stresses of life. \\"I was away from Indian Relay for 21 years but I was never away from horses. They're a part of me.\\" The Blackfoot Nation is a Native American territory in Montana. Tribal elder Carol Murray admits Indian Relay is little known nationwide but describes the sport as \\"magical.\\" \\"It's the spirit of the animals and the spirit of the people coming together. But what amazes me is the effect it has on the spectators as well,\\" explains Murray, whose son used to race and whose grandson is now entering the sport as a rider. \\"You see the faces of the families watching and it's understandable how excited they are supporting their family members or their teams. But you look across the crowds at races and everyone's just so involved. It's a magical sport.\\" Murray has helped it gain slightly wider acclaim after being introduced to American filmmaker Charles Dye, who last year released a documentary called \\"Indian Relay.\\" It takes an in-depth look at the sport and the characters within it, including Murray and Old Horn. The project was a labor of love for Dye, who spent the first of the four years it took to complete trying to gain the trust of the communities -- no mean feat when there is a mistrust of outsiders. But gradually Dye managed to get a true insight into the lives of those who eat, sleep and breathe the sport, in communities which are often very poor and where adult unemployment can be as high as 80%. \\"Some of these are super-duper poor communities and in some cases without Indian Relay some of the young kids would fall into trouble,\\" he says. Dye had some prior knowledge of Indian Relay but admits his project became less about the sport and more about the people, the tribes and the communities it touches. \\"You feel like you're falling off the edge of the world,\\" says Dye, who followed teams from the Shoshone-Bannock Nation in Idaho and the Crow and Blackfoot Nations. \\"You're in the wild west with no real connection to the rest of the world. It's quite magical. My film was not so much about horse racing, I guess, as the rural west.\\" However, the film does capture the madness of the racing and the horse exchanges -- which occur with rider and animal moving at full pelt. \\"These are top horses often at the ends of their career,\\" Dye explains. \\"So they're obviously going at some speed. \\"There's dangers but not as many people get hurt as you might think. I think the whole time I was there I saw one hospitalization and the guy was fine in the end.\\" Old Horn admits that \\"nobody went into this sport and didn't get hurt\\" but points out the injuries are relatively low because of the expertise of those involved. \\"You need to have an incredibly high level of horsemanship both by the riders and those on the ground,\\" he says. \\"We don't wear helmets and saddles as we're considered some of the best horse people on the face of the earth. \\"If we wore those, we'd be a laughing stock. That's our pride and we take great pride in it.\\" Indian Relay is immersed in the middle of its season, with races virtually every weekend. Prize money is on offer but the amounts are relatively small, particularly given how far funds have to stretch among the team setup. But Old Horn says it is not about the money: \\"It's about the pride, about the bragging rights when you win over the other tribes.\\" Murray echoes the overriding element of pride, but admits that watching her family members race at breakneck speed can be a harsh experience. Her faith in their horse-handling, however, makes it easier viewing. \\"It is nerve wracking,\\" she says. \\"I remember seeing my son Little Plume ride for the first time. He really wanted to ride but had to wait to get picked. I was in the stands and suddenly my friend was like, 'That's your son racing.' \\"I thought no-one would pick him and so it was like, 'Oh my God.' So from there it's no turning back, I can't stop him. Horses have always been in my family -- it's part of my life, an extension of me. \\"And it's so good. I remember how hard my son worked feeding, exercising the horses, doing everything that was required. It's a special thing.\\" Riders like Little Plume are \\"treated like rock stars,\\" says Dye, but only to a local audience. \\"The funny thing is that in the next-door town some people won't have even heard of it,\\" he adds.

The studies, mostly carried out in the prefix = st1 /United States, largely focused on television, but some looked at video games, films, music, computer and Internet use. Three quarters of them found that increased media viewing was connected with poor health. The studies offered strong evidence that children who get more media exposure are more likely to become overweight, start smoking and begin earlier sexual activity than those who spend less time in front of a screen, the researchers said. Studies also showed more media exposure is linked to drug and alcohol use and poorer school performance. \\"We were pretty surprised by the number of studies that showed these negative health results,\\" said one of the researchers in the report. For decades, experts have worried about the effect on young viewers of the violence and sexual content in some TV programs, movies and video games. Another issue is that kids are spending time sitting on a couch watching TV or playing computer games when they could be running around outside. One study found that children who spend more than eight hours watching TV per week at age 3 are more likely to be overweight at 7. And research showed that many USchildren watch far more. Another study showed TV and other media content can have a deep influence on children's attitudes and beliefs, particularly among teens.

Watch videos of other choir directors online. Watch live performances of professional choirs and focus on what the director does and how the singers respond to each signal. Go to live choir performances and watch the director. Be sure you choose a seat that enables a clear view of the director. Take notes about what seems to work especially well. Sit in on a choir rehearsal and watch the director from the singers’ points of view. Writing down the signals that you plan to use will lead to more consistency when used.

Solve 0 = 379*a + 745*a + 6744 for a.","output":"To solve the equation for the variable a, follow these steps: 1. Combine like terms on the left hand side of the equation. The given equation is: 0 = 379*a + 745*a + 6744 Combine the terms with 'a' in them: 0 = (379 + 745) * a + 6744 0 = 1124 * a + 6744 2. Isolate the variable term on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 6744 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 6744 = 1124 * a + 6744 - 6744 -6744 = 1124 * a 3. Solve for the variable a. To get the value of 'a', divide both sides of the equation by 1124: -6744 / 1124 = (1124 * a) / 1124 -6 = a So, the solution to the given equation is a = -6."},{"instruction":"Who made a cameo appearance in 39 movies directed by Alfred Hitchcock????","output":"Alfred Hitchcock himself made cameo appearances in 39 of his own movies. Hitchcock was a celebrated British filmmaker and producer, known for his mastery of the suspense and thriller genres. Over a career that spanned more than six decades, he directed more than 50 feature films and gained a reputation as the \\"Master of Suspense\\". Hitchcock's cameo appearances became a personal trademark, adding a touch of whimsy and self-reference to his work. These appearances were usually brief, non-speaking roles, where he would appear as a passerby, a bus passenger, or a figure in the crowd. Audiences would often watch his films with the anticipation of spotting the director's cameo, turning it into a fun game that has continued to be popular among fans. Here are some notable examples of Alfred Hitchcock's cameo appearances in his films: 1. The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927) - In one of his earliest cameos, Hitchcock can be seen sitting at a desk in a newsroom. 2. Blackmail (1929) - Hitchcock is seen being bothered by a young boy while reading a book on a subway. 3. The 39 Steps (1935) - As the protagonist exits a bus, Hitchcock can be spotted walking by while tossing a piece of paper. 4. Young and Innocent (1937) - Hitchcock is seen as a photographer outside the courthouse during a murder trial. 5. Rebecca (1940) - In his first American film, Hitchcock is seen walking behind George Sanders as he makes a phone call. 6. Rear Window (1954) - Hitchcock is seen winding the clock in composer's apartment. 7. North by Northwest (1959) - In probably his most memorable cameo, Hitchcock misses a bus during the opening credits sequence. 8. Psycho (1960) - Hitchcock is seen standing outside Marion Crane's office, wearing a cowboy hat. 9. The Birds (1963) - Hitchcock is seen walking out of a pet store as Tippi Hedren enters. These cameos created a sense of connection between Hitchcock and his audience, establishing a unique tradition that has gone on to inspire other directors. In fact, several contemporary filmmakers like M. Night Shyamalan, Martin Scorsese, and Quentin Tarantino have continued the tradition by appearing in their own films in minor, often humorous, roles."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"Five people looking at artwork.\\" is it true that \\"People are observing art.\\"?

Can you inject a person with cancer? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"When trying to understand the consequences of injecting a healthy person with cancer cells, it's first essential to have background knowledge of cancer, which is a complex disease. Cancer arises due to the uncontrolled growth and division of cells within the body. These cells often have gene mutations that disrupt the body's normal cell regulatory mechanisms, causing the cells to grow and invade healthy tissues. Cancer cells can break away from their initial site, entering the bloodstream or lymphatic system, and travel to other parts of the body where they may form secondary tumors. In response to the first question, the answer is not straightforward, as the development of cancer in a healthy person injected with cancer cells depends on several factors, such as the individual's immune system, the viability of the injected cells, and the cancer type. The immune system plays a crucial role in preventing the development of cancer. It can identify and eliminate abnormal or foreign cells, including cancer cells. If a healthy person with a well-functioning immune system is injected with cancer cells, it is likely that their immune system will recognize the foreign cells and destroy them, thus preventing the development of cancer. However, individuals with impaired immune systems or certain genetic factors might be more susceptible to developing cancer after being injected with cancer cells. Furthermore, injected cancer cells might not be viable or able to establish a tumor due to the body's natural defense systems, external factors, or the specific characteristics of the cancer cells themselves. The type and aggressiveness of the injected cancer vary and may influence the outcome as well. When referring to the second question, it is theoretically possible to inject a person with cancer cells. For example, in medical research, scientists often inject cancer cells in laboratory animals, such as mice, to study cancer's growth and test potential treatments. This practice is known as creating a xenograft or cancer cell transplantation model. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that injecting a person with cancer cells is ethically and morally unacceptable in a non-research context. As mentioned earlier, several factors contribute to whether one will develop cancer after being injected with cancer cells, and the outcome is not guaranteed. Regarding your final query, the two questions provided are not direct paraphrases of each other. Instead, they can be interpreted as follow-up inquiries or closely related subjects. The first question assesses the likelihood of a healthy person developing cancer after being injected with cancer cells, while the second question questions the feasibility of injecting someone with cancer cells. While both questions explore the relationship between injecting cancer cells and cancer development, they focus on different aspects, and each question has context-specific implications."},{"instruction":"Produce a brief English sentence that would be considered grammatically acceptable","output":"\\"The dog is running in the park.\\" This sentence means there's a dog and it's using its legs to move fast inside a place where people go to play or relax, called a park."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

In 1984, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10% of their federal highway funds. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, see Additional Notes below). South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate. The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans, because of it being higher than the age of majority (18 in most states) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the tenth amendment. Although debates have not been highly publicized, a few states have proposed legislation to lower their drinking age, while Guam has raised its drinking age to 21 in July 2010. is the legal drinking age the same in every state?

Yes or no? Answer: These systems can range from a restaurant system with a single low-power transmitter, to a nationwide system with thousands of high-power base stations. Question: how is a telephone pagers made Answer:","output":"A telephone pager, also known as a beeper or simply a pager, is a wireless telecommunication device that receives and displays alphanumeric or voice messages. These devices were extensively used in the 1980s and 1990s as a precursor to modern smartphones. Though telephone pagers have largely been replaced by mobile phones, they are still in use in specialized contexts such as hospitals, emergency services, and other situations where a fast and reliable communication method is necessary. In this detailed answer, we will discuss the components of a telephone pager and how it is made. 1. Design and Planning: The process of manufacturing a telephone pager begins with design and planning. Engineers develop a blueprint for the pager based on specific requirements and functionalities. This involves determining the size, shape, materials, and components required to build the device. This stage also includes decisions about the type of pager – alphanumeric, numeric, or voice – and the desired range and power of the device. 2. Components: A typical telephone pager consists of several key components that work together to provide the desired functionality: - Antenna: A pager's antenna receives radio frequency (RF) signals from the transmitter. It can be an external or internal (built-in) component, depending on the design. - Receiver: The receiver translates the RF signals into digital or analog signals that the pager can understand. - Decoding Circuitry: When the pager receives an incoming message, the decoding circuitry processes the signal, checks for errors, and determines if the message is intended for the pager. - Memory: Pagers store incoming messages in memory, allowing users to review and manage them. - Microprocessor: The microprocessor controls the pager's functions and manages all data processes. - Display: The display provides a visual representation of the messages or notifications. It can be an LED, LCD, or E-ink display depending on the pager design. - Notifications: Many pagers offer a variety of notification options, such as vibrations, beeps, or flashing lights that alert users to incoming messages. - Battery: Pagers are usually powered by a battery, which provides necessary energy to the components. 3. Assembly: Once the design is finalized, and components are sourced, the next step in manufacturing a telephone pager is assembly. Electronics manufacturers employ various methods, such as surface-mount technology (SMT) and through-hole technology (THT), to attach components to a printed circuit board (PCB). The PCB serves as the backbone that connects and supports all the pager's components. After the components are assembled on the PCB, the device is often enclosed in a protective casing made of plastic or other suitable materials. 4. Testing and Quality Control: Before pagers are released for sale or distribution, they undergo extensive testing to ensure that they function as intended. This involves testing the reception, signal decoding, and notification capabilities of the device. All components and features must be verified to meet quality standards and avoid any possible malfunctions. 5. Packaging and Distribution: Finally, after passing the quality control tests, the pagers are packaged with user manuals, accessories (such as a holster or belt clip), and batteries. They are then distributed to retail outlets, service providers, or other relevant customers. In conclusion, telephone pagers are made through a carefully planned process that involves designing, planning, sourcing and assembling components, quality control, and distribution. The manufacturing of a telephone pager depends on its intended purpose, whether for a single, low-power system like a restaurant or for broader applications like nationwide paging systems featuring thousands of high-power base stations. Today, although their usage is limited, pagers remain an important and reliable communication tool in specific industries and emergency services."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents.

As the conversation progresses, Philip continues to make remarks about her physical attractiveness and uses a suggestive comment about her looking \\"good enough to eat\\". This makes Mary feel uncomfortable, and she responds with hesitations and discomfort, not knowing how to engage in the conversation. As the dialogue continues, Philip becomes more insistent and seems to crave validation from Mary, asking her to reciprocate by complimenting him as well. Mary, however, feels that the conversation has taken a strange turn, and expresses her confusion and reluctance to engage in the dialogue further. At this point, Philip begins to make generalizations about women, accuses Mary of not being nice, and suggests that all women are the same. Mary's confusion and discomfort increase when Philip unexpectedly sends her an inappropriate picture, a dick pic, to which she responds with shock and announces that she wants to end the conversation. Philip, becoming hostile as a result, lashes out at Mary with an offensive remark. In summary, the conversation seemed to be an attempt by Philip to connect with Mary initially through compliments about her looks but quickly became inappropriate, making Mary uncomfortable. As Mary hesitated and expressed her discomfort, Philip became more insistent and ultimately hostile, leading to the end of the conversation."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Martin is unsure of Ripley, but Ripley's goddaughter, Alexandra Korolenko (Radha Mitchell), who is also Victor's daughter, convinces him otherwise, although Ripley does not like that the two are getting close. Ripley tells Martin the plan, that they are going to steal from a Russian museum that has been smuggling Russian treasures into the country and bribing the NYPD with large donations and expensive equipment. The two infiltrate a party at the museum posing as cops, with Ripley as Lt. Weber (Robert Forster), a cop who has a particular vendetta against Ripley, to gather information about their vault. The Russian mob, led by Nicky Petrovitch (Rade Å erbedÅ¾ija), grow impatient with Ripley and kidnap Alexandra, telling them they must steal two FabergÃ© eggs from the Russian Museum in order to get her back, or she dies. When the duo get into the vaults of the museum with the eggs, Martin reveals he is an undercover cop from Miami planted by Weber to catch Ripley, leaves Ripley locked in the vault and informs Weber, while taking the eggs to the Russian mobster to free Alexandra. After Alexandra is released Martin is forced to meet with Nicky who reveals that the eggs they have stolen are made of wood (like the Karelian Birch egg). Meanwhile, Weber and his squad enter the museum, but are detained by the security guards due to Martin telling the guards he was a cop as he escaped. Martin reports in to the police the next morning after the police have picked up Nicky, only to learn that the man they have in custody is not the man Martin met, and that the man he met was actually Victor Korolenko, who had faked his death with Ripley's help. It is then revealed that Ripley had escaped, letting the museum know...

Context: On 25 November at the Korean western front, the PVA 13th Army Group attacked and overran the ROK II Corps at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, and then decimated the US 2nd Infantry Division on the UN forces' right flank. The UN Command retreated; the U.S. Eighth Army's retreat (the longest in US Army history) was made possible because of the Turkish Brigade's successful, but very costly, rear-guard delaying action near Kunuri that slowed the PVA attack for two days (27–29 November). On 27 November at the Korean eastern front, a U.S. 7th Infantry Division Regimental Combat Team (3,000 soldiers) and the U.S. 1st Marine Division (12,000–15,000 marines) were unprepared for the PVA 9th Army Group's three-pronged encirclement tactics at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, but they managed to escape under Air Force and X Corps support fire—albeit with some 15,000 collective casualties.

Available options: (1). watch the turtle (2). wanted to care for nature (3). wanted to use the turtle","output":"Based on the context given, Remy set the turtle on land after accidentally capturing it in his net. This action reflects Remy's desire and conscious decision to care for nature. His unintended capture of the turtle could have resulted in harm or stress for the animal, but by choosing to release it, he prevented any negative consequences that could have ensued. Turtles, like many animals, are very sensitive to changes in their environment and being caught in a net would undoubtedly be a terrifying experience for the creature. Furthermore, keeping the turtle might have been a violation of wildlife laws, which generally discourage the capture and retention of wild animals, especially if the turtle is a member of a threatened or endangered species. By setting the animal free, Remy showed his respect and concern for the wellbeing of individual animals and the balance of nature as a whole. He understands that the disruption, however unintentional, of a creature's life can have cascading effects on the surrounding ecosystem. For instance, should the turtle be a key predator in its environment, its absence could lead to overpopulation of its prey, which in turn could lead to depletion of certain plant life, and so on. Alternately, if the turtle is an important quarry for other predators, its absence could mean scarce food resources for other beings. For these reasons, any respecter of nature recognizes the importance of leaving wildlife in the wild whenever possible. Of the available options, watching the turtle or using the turtle are less likely, given the context. Choosing to watch the turtle would not necessarily require placing it on land - Remy could just as easily observe the creature in water. Moreover, Remy released the turtle rather than making use of it in any way, meaning that the third option - wanting to use the turtle - is also inconsistent with the actions described. Without more information, the most plausible explanation for Remy's actions, based on the situation at hand, is that he wanted to care for nature. Remy's decision to release the turtle highlights a significant commitment to preserving the natural world and a desire to minimize human interference with wildlife. This kind of conscientious behavior is essential in the ongoing global effort to protect and conserve biodiversity and it is critical for the survival of many sensitive species. His action represents a respect for the environment and the creatures in it. In an era where industrial activities often lead to the destruction of natural habitats and the decimation of species, Remy's act is small yet crucial. To conclude, in this context where Remy set the turtle on land after unintentionally capturing it, the most logical inference is that he wanted to care for nature. This is a reflection of his respect for wildlife, his understanding of the importance of maintaining ecological balance, and his awareness and adherence to conservation ethics."},{"instruction":"Bakan, BM'deki Sırp yanlısı ses olan Rusya'ya yaptığı son ziyarette bu tutumuna dair güvenceler aldığını da sözlerine ekledi.

I will first begin with summarizing what an Advent candle is. Advent candles are a Christian tradition involving the lighting of candles to symbolize the passing of the four weeks of Advent in the liturgical calendar of the Western church. 2. Then, I will provide the symbolisation of the four candles during Advent. These candles, typically three are purple and one is pink (rose), each symbolize a different theme associated with the spiritual preparation during the season of Advent: a) The First Candle (Purple): The \\"Prophecy Candle\\" symbolizing Hope, and the prophecies about the coming of Jesus Christ. b) The Second Candle (Purple): The \\"Bethlehem Candle,\\" symbolising Love and the manger where Jesus was born. c) The Third Candle (Pink): The \\"Shepherd’s Candle,\\" symbolising Joy and the joy brought to the world by the birth of Jesus. This candle is lit on the third Sunday, Gaudete Sunday, when the priest also wears rose vestments at Mass; Gaudete Sunday is the Sunday of rejoicing. d) The Fourth Candle (Purple): The \\"Angel’s Candle,\\" symbolising Peace and the message of the angels: “Peace on Earth, Good Will Toward Men.” Justification: Each week of Advent, a new candle is lit on the Advent wreath. The color and order of these candles have unique meanings and symbolism related to the spiritual tenants of hope, love, joy, and peace, which are central to the period of Advent. These symbolisations have been collected from a broad understanding of Christian traditions, but can vary slightly between individual denominations."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"A teenage girl has been arrested after the remains of a newborn baby were found in a Kent street.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Arrest Made in Connection to Disturbing Discovery: Newborn Baby's Remains Found in Kent Street Introduction: A heartbreaking incident has shaken the community of Kent as the remains of a newborn baby were discovered in one of its streets.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring farms used different farming methods. Hill farm used GMO seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds.

This article delves into the chilling tactics employed by the couple and the tragic events that unfolded as a result of their cold-hearted scheme. Murder of Mark Emanuel Spencer Mark Emanuel Spencer, a beloved member of the Gold Coast community, was found bludgeoned to death at his own home. The disturbing discovery was made by the local police, who were called to the scene after reports of suspicious activities in the area. Upon further investigation, it was revealed that Spencer had responded to an advertisement for sex on the popular classified website Craigslist, not knowing that it was the bait laid out by his killers. Arrests and Revelations A 33-year-old mother of three and her 28-year-old partner were swiftly arrested on Wednesday after the gruesome murder for their participation in this elaborate scheme. Both have been charged with the heinous crime, and they now remain in custody for their alleged roles in the deadly plot.

The police are investigating the possibility that other individuals have fallen prey to the duo's wicked tactics. The couple worked in tandem to formulate the potentially embarrassing situations that their victims would be placed in, all in the name of personal gain. Once an individual responded to the deceptive advertisement on Craigslist, the couple would proceed to rob the unsuspecting victims, often using physical violence in the process. Due to the sensitive nature of the encounters, the victims would be hesitant to report the incidents to the police, thus allowing the couple to continue their devious pursuits. A Community Mourns & Seeks Change The tragic and senseless murder of Mark Emanuel Spencer in this twisted plot has left his family, friends, and the entire Gold Coast community in complete shock and mourning.

The term is derived from Moon's surname and is often used by outsiders, including the media, to describe members of the church. The Unification Church is also commonly called the \\"Moon Church\\" due to its association with Sun Myung Moon. The Unification Church has its roots in Christianity but mixes elements from other religious traditions as well. It teaches that Jesus Christ's mission was left incomplete following his crucifixion, and that Sun Myung Moon was commissioned by God to continue and complete Jesus' work in establishing the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. The followers believe that Sun Myung Moon and his wife, Hak Ja Han, represent the \\"True Parents\\" of humankind, positioned to restore humanity's relationship with God. \\"Moonies\\" have often been portrayed as a controversial group, in part because of the church's mass weddings, called the Blessing Ceremony, where thousands of couples, some of whom had only just met, would be married simultaneously. These weddings were seen as a way to break down barriers between different races and nationalities, thus helping to create a unified world. Additionally, the Unification Church has been accused of coercive recruitment tactics, brainwashing, and financial exploitation of its members, which contributed to its controversial image. However, it is essential to mention that many members of the Unification Church do not appreciate being called \\"Moonies\\" and consider the term derogatory. They see it as a way to undermine and belittle their religious beliefs and practices. Over the years, the Unification Church has established various businesses, educational institutions, and media outlets as part of its mission to promote its teachings and create a foundation for the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. Sun Myung Moon passed away in 2012, and his wife, Hak Ja Han, now leads the church. The Unification Church continues to carry out its activities, evolve, and adapt to contemporary society while working towards its vision of global unity and peace."},{"instruction":"If a large number of Islamists from the Caucasus have Russian citizenship, will we be allowing potential terrorists into the country without visa requirements? Translate to Romanian Romanian:","output":"Dacă un număr mare de islamiști din Caucaz au cetățenie rusă, vom permite intrarea unor potențiali teroriști în țară fără cerințele de viză? Există mai multe aspecte de analizat în această problemă complexă. În primul rând, este important să recunoaștem că orice situație care implică intrarea persoanelor într-o țară implică un echilibru între securitate și libertatea de mișcare. Cu cât se aplică mai multe restricții și controale, cu atât poate crește nivelul de securitate, dar poate provoca, de asemenea, probleme sau limitări pentru cei care doresc să călătorească sau să emigreze legal. Un alt aspect important de luat în considerare este faptul că terorismul nu se limitează la o singură naționalitate, etnie sau religie. Chiar dacă există un număr mare de islamiști din Caucaz cu cetățenie rusă, nu înseamnă că toate aceste persoane sunt teroriști sau că orice terorist care dorește să intre într-o țară va fi neapărat de această origine. Este posibil ca teroriști sau simpatizanți ai unor organizații teroriste să aparțină unor naționalități diferite și să încerce să intre într-o țară prin diverse mijloace. În plus, este important să se facă diferența între persoanele care au cetățenie rusă și cele care sunt în mod specific islamiste din Caucaz. Nu toți cetățenii ruși au aceleași convingeri sau intenții, iar asumarea că toți reprezintă un risc doar pe baza naționalității lor poate fi incorectă și discriminatoare. Evaluarea riscului de terorism necesită adesea măsuri de securitate și inteligență specifice. În loc să se bazeze exclusiv pe criterii ca naționalitatea, etnia sau religia, autoritățile ar trebui să folosească informații și date obținute din diverse surse pentru a identifica persoanele care pot reprezenta efectiv un risc și apoi să decidă dacă aceste persoane trebuie sau nu să respecte cerințele de viză. În concluzie, este esențial să se evalueze cu atenție întreaga situație, luând în considerare mai mulți factori, înainte de a decide dacă permitem sau nu intrarea potențialilor teroriști în țară fără cerințele de viză. Aceasta include analizarea informațiilor despre persoanele care ar putea reprezenta un risc și a colabora cu alte țări și agenții internaționale pentru a împărtăși informații și stratagii de prevenire a terorismului. Abordarea acestei probleme prin generalizare și impunerea de restricții pe baza unor caracteristici specifice, cum ar fi cetățenia, poate fi ineficientă și poate conduce la discriminare și tensiuni inutile."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

When she becomes aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread.Guerin begins by interviewing the prepubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing projects. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved.As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her being removed from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation.On June 26, 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous citations for speeding she has ignored. She is charged a nominal fine of £100, and while en route home calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news.

Answer:","output":"The result of Veronica Guerin's death had a profound and lasting impact on Ireland, particularly in relation to crime and journalism. Her tenacity and dedication to uncovering the truth about Dublin's illegal drug trade and the individuals behind it made her a beloved and respected figure in the community. Her assassination triggered a series of events and consequences that can be enumerated as follows: 1. Public Outrage and Demand for Change: Veronica Guerin's death sparked widespread outrage and grief amongst the Irish public. It highlighted the dangerous extent to which organized crime was operating in the country, and the government faced immense pressure to crack down on drug traffickers, gangs, and the violence associated with them. There was a strong public demand for stricter laws and tougher penalties for those involved in drug-related crimes. 2. Crime Legislation: In response to public outcry and as a direct result of Guerin's murder, the Irish government established the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in 1996. The CAB was created to seize assets and ill-gotten gains from criminals and dismantle their financial networks. This was a significant change in Ireland's approach to crime, as it allowed law enforcement to target criminals through their finances and disrupt their operations. Additionally, the government passed a series of laws aimed at strengthening criminal justice, including the Proceeds of Crime Act (1996) and the Organized Crime Act (1997). 3. Increased Support for Investigative Journalism: Guerin's death brought attention to the importance and potential dangers associated with investigative journalism. This led to an increase in support and resources allocated to investigative journalism in Ireland, with an emphasis on protecting journalists and their sources. News organizations became more committed to funding and promoting such work, recognizing its vital role in uncovering corruption, crime, and other societal issues. 4. Veronica Guerin: A Symbol of Bravery and Commitment: Guerin's courage and determination to expose the truth, even in the face of personal danger, made her a symbol of bravery and commitment for journalists and the general public alike. In the years since her death, her name has become synonymous with the fight against organized crime and the pursuit of justice. Awards, scholarships, and events have been established in her honor, celebrating her legacy and inspiring others to continue her work. 5. Media Adaptations: Veronica Guerin's story has been adapted into various forms of media, further cementing her place in the public consciousness. In 2003, a biographical crime film titled \\"Veronica Guerin,\\" starring Cate Blanchett in the title role, was released to critical acclaim. The film portrays Guerin's investigation into the drug trade and the events leading up to her murder, thereby bringing her story to an international audience. In conclusion, the result of Veronica Guerin's death led to significant changes in Irish society, law enforcement, and journalism. Her work and ultimate sacrifice brought awareness to the dangers of organized crime and the importance of investigative journalism in holding criminals accountable. As a result, her legacy continues to inspire others, both in Ireland and across the globe, to fight for truth and justice."},{"instruction":"I thought I might get some good ideas if I went down to the hospital.

The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor.

As well as his 24 goals in 37 games for United, a big part of Ibrahimovic's impact is the effect he has had on his team-mates. His influence has been compared with that of Old Trafford legend Eric Cantona - and I can understand why. We know Ibrahimovic has got fantastic individual ability, but his charisma and the way he carries himself has seen him become the team's talisman. Media playback is not supported on this device It must be brilliant for United's young players - like Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard - to be around someone with Ibrahimovic's appetite, energy and desire. They can learn some things from him on the pitch during games, of course, but working with him every day and seeing his attitude in training and the dressing room will be invaluable experience for them. That is another reason for United to keep him, although even if he does stay I am pretty certain they will still go for a big-hitter in the summer to either play with him up front, or compete for his place. Ibrahimovic's mentality has not changed despite everything he has done in his career - he is still determined to be the best. He has played in the vast majority of United's games this season, which for someone his age is a superb achievement - in all competitions, Leicester's Wes Morgan is the only Premier League player to play more minutes. It is not as if Ibrahimovic is taking it easy, either. His languid style means it does not always look as if he is doing a lot of running during games, but he typically covers 9km every 90 minutes - the same distance per match as a striker as hard-working as Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, for example. All of that helps to show Ibrahimovic's hunger, and also demonstrates he is still a supreme athlete. However, both of those statistics would be overlooked if he was not scoring goals too. They are the really impressive thing and set him apart from other 35-year-old footballers. They have made a big difference for United too. His goal against Blackburn in the FA Cup on Sunday was his ninth winner in all competitions this season. Altogether his goals have earned United 11 points in the Premier League alone - a joint league high for 2016-17 with Chelsea's Diego Costa. Media playback is not supported on this device I played in the Premier League until I was almost 36 and to compete at that age you need to have a hunger in training, not just want to keep playing more games. On a day-to-day basis you have to keep pushing yourself. Your body is taking more and more punishment and it becomes harder and harder to get through it. You need to have huge willpower, but you also need a manager who understands what you need - when you need a rest, and when you do and don't need to train. Ibrahimovic has that in Jose Mourinho, which is great, but he still has to go out and do the business on the pitch. Mourinho has helped him there too because he knows he has a player who needs feeding, and their style of play does precisely that. The key for United is getting the ball up to Ibrahimovic, then getting players around him and running beyond him to deliver it into the box. They were not quite managing it earlier in the season but now they have found a way of making it work that suits Ibrahimovic and, more importantly, the team. If you give Ibrahimovic chances, the rest is up to him. United have been doing the first bit - he has had more shots at goal this season than any other Premier League player. Then of course his ability takes over, which is why he is delivering the goods. Media playback is not supported on this device Ibrahimovic has already been a winner at Wembley this season, when his goal against Leicester clinched the Community Shield. On Sunday he will get the chance to get his hands on more silverware when his side play Southampton in the EFL Cup final (16:30 GMT kick-off), but United will not be taking success for granted. Not many people gave Southampton a chance over two legs against Liverpool in the semi-finals and I think they have enough going forward to cause United problems. It will be a blow for United if Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Michael Carrick miss the game through injury, as Mourinho fears, but United will still rightly go into the game as favourites. Ibrahimovic's form obviously marks him out as their danger man, and he has already scored twice against Saints this season when he got off the mark at Old Trafford with both goals in a United win in August. So Southampton will know how big a threat he is when the ball comes into their box - what might decide the game is whether they can stop him this time. Alan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. What is a summary of this text?","output":"This text is talking about a soccer player named Ibrahimovic who is 35 years old and plays for a team called United. Even though he is older than most players, he is still very good and has scored many goals. His team looks up to him and he helps the younger players learn. There is a big game coming up against a team called Southampton and people think Ibrahimovic will be an important player in the match."},{"instruction":"What is the answer: In Greek mythology what is the name of the youth loved and accidentally killed by Apollo, and from whose blood Apollo caused a flower to grow?","output":"To find the answer to this question, I will go through the following steps: 1.

In one of several heated moments during the clash, the usually poised 27-year-old appeared to hurl a string of expletives towards Czech player Tomas Berdych. As tensions boiled over, the devoted supporter was caught on camera appearing to mouth 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***', or 'Take that, you flash f**k’. Scroll down for video Kim Sears (pictured left and right) appeared to unleash the tirade as she watched Andy Murray do battle in the Australian Open semi-final But there was no doubt that it added a fiery edge to the match, with Murray admitting afterwards that there had been acrimonious mood around","output":"the court. The incident involving Kim Sears, who has been dating Andy Murray since 2005 and got engaged to him in November 2014, took place during the highly intense and competitive semi-final match of the Australian Open against Czech player Tomas Berdych. The match was marked by several heated moments and high emotions on both sides. Kim Sears, who is usually known for her calm and poised demeanor while supporting Andy Murray during his matches, seemed to lose her cool during one of the crucial moments of the match. Caught on camera, she appeared to hurl a string of expletives towards Berdych, the rival player. This incident led to a significant uproar and discussion in the media and among tennis fans, as it was quite unusual for Sears to display such strong emotions and be explicitly aggressive towards an opponent. Andy Murray, who has always been protective and supportive of his fiancée, came to her defense after the match, saying that it was just a highly emotional and intense contest with both players giving their all to win it. He explained that the incident should not be blown out of proportion and that everyone has moments when they lose their cool. Murray also acknowledged that there was an acrimonious atmosphere around the court, which could have contributed to Kim Sears' emotional outburst. Murray pointed out that it is only natural for the emotions of the people close to the players, especially their partners, to spill over during such high-stake matches. As professional athletes, their loved ones also feel the immense pressure and stress that they go through during such crucial matches. In this case, Kim Sears' tirade was most likely a manifestation of the tension she was experiencing while watching her fiancé play an important and challenging match. In addition, Murray urged the public to be more understanding and empathetic towards the situation, instead of being critical and judgmental. It is essential to recognize that everyone has moments of weakness and emotional outbursts, especially in high-pressure situations, and the incident involving Kim Sears should be seen as an isolated one rather than an indication of her character. The incident, albeit controversial, did add a fiery edge to the match and increased the intensity of the competition between the two players. It also served as a stark reminder that tennis players and their families go through a significant amount of stress and pressure during such important tournaments. Nonetheless, it is crucial to maintain a level of sportsmanship both on and off the court, while also accepting that emotions can sometimes get the better of even the most composed individuals."},{"instruction":"Answer based on context: In 1795, the French revolutionary army invaded the Dutch Republic and turned the nation into a satellite of France, named the Batavian Republic. Britain, which was at war with France, soon moved to occupy Dutch colonies in Asia, South Africa and the Caribbean. Under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens signed by Britain and France in 1802, the Cape Colony and the islands of the Dutch West Indies that the British had seized were returned to the Republic. Ceylon was not returned to the Dutch and was made a British Crown Colony. After the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and France again in 1803, the British retook the Cape Colony. The British also invaded and captured the island of Java in 1811. In 1806, Napoleon dissolved the Batavian Republic and established a monarchy with his brother, Louis Bonaparte, on the throne as King of the Netherlands. Louis was removed from power by Napoleon in 1810, and the country was ruled directly from France until its liberation in 1813. The following year, the independent Netherlands signed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 with Britain.

They come in many shapes and sizes, and are often sold as either cylinders or sliced discs. The texture of a loofah is rough when dry, but once you add hot water it becomes soft and supple. Loofahs are available at most stores that sell body care accessories, including drugstores. Loofahs are different from plastic bath poufs; the two items are used for the same purpose, but loofahs are made from a plant-based material and are said to be better for the skin. Warmer water will cause the loofah to get softer more quickly. If you want the loofah to retain some texture and scrubbing ability, just wet it slightly before proceeding. Many people use body wash, which easily seeps into the surface of the loofah, but rubbing bar soap over its surface works as well. A little soap goes a long way; you only need a dime-sized amount or so. Starting at your decolletage (the expanse of skin between your neck and chest), gently but firmly rub the loofah against your skin in circular motions. Work your way down to your ankles and then repeat along the back of the body. Don't forget to scrub your arms and hands as well. Care should be used around delicate areas such as underarms. If your skin is dry, rinse the soap out of the loofah before using it on your arms and legs. Additionally, you can use the loofah on the heels and soles of your feet. Be careful if standing in a slippery shower. The circular motion will help remove dead skin cells and is gentler on your skin than scrubbing up and down. This will close your pores and make you feel awake and refreshed. If trying to lull yourself to sleep with a shower or bath, use warm water instead. What is a summary?","output":"A loofah is a plant-based scrubbing tool used for cleaning our body.

The £37million man from Chelsea is set to fly from Battersea in south London straight to United's training ground. Sources close to the player have revealed that Mata has been told things are being put in place for his arrival at Carrington. Window of opportunity: Robin van Persie arrives for training and United will hope to have him back soon. Not looking clever: Tom Cleverley arrives the day after the semi-final penalties defeat by Sunderland. Arrival: Nemanja Vidic, suspended for the Sunderland debacle, drives into the training ground. A tough gig: Ryan Giggs looks lees-than impressed as he arrives at Carrington. In the shadows: Marquee summer signing Marouane Fellaini is recovering from injury. Coach in the car: Phil Neville arrives for what surely will be a chastening day at training. Flops: Shinji Kagawa (left) and Alexander Buttner both played in the semi-final loss. Flying visit: Juan Mata arrived in Manchester via helicopter as he closes in on his £37million switch to United. He has been told to be ready to leave his apartment in Chelsea at short notice and travel to a helicopter flight base in nearby Battersea. Once in Manchester, the Spanish playmaker is due to have a look round United's impressive training base, meet manager David Moyes and then head to the Bridgewater Hospital near the city centre for a medical. Back at Chelsea's training ground, Jose Mourinho was all smiles as he watched his players train ahead of the weekend FA Cup clash with Stoke. United do not have a game as they are already out of the FA Cup but it is hoped that Mata will train with his new team-mates on Friday and be ready for next Tuesday's home game against Cardiff in the Barclays Premier League.

Big decision: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is happy to let Spanish playmaker Juan Mata join Manchester United. Out of sorts: Manchester United were knocked out of the League Cup after losing to Sunderland on penalties. Mata will arrive to find United at a new low after their numbing Capital One Cup shambles at home to Sunderland on Wednesday night. Moyes and his players are due at Carrington at 11am to warm down and go through the detritus of a night that ended in penalty shootout failure.

Would \\"The most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting, where files can be uploaded via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or a Web interface.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"Hosting a website refers to the process of storing and maintaining a website's files, data, and associated resources on a specialized computer known as a web server. The web server is connected to the Internet, which allows users to access the website through their internet browsers. When a user enters a website's address (URL) into their browser, the browser makes a request to the web server hosting the site. The server then compiles and sends the requested files to the user's browser, which interprets and displays the website content accordingly. The answer provided, \\"The most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting, where files can be uploaded via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or a Web interface,\\" is a reasonable explanation of a fundamental type of web hosting service. However, there are numerous other aspects to consider when discussing website hosting. Various types of web hosting services cater to different requirements based on the site's complexity, anticipated traffic, and functionality. Here are the primary categories of web hosting services: 1. Shared hosting: In this type of hosting, multiple websites share the resources of a single web server, making it an affordable option for small-scale websites with low to moderate traffic. As resources are shared, performance and availability can be affected if other websites on the server experience high traffic or technical issues. 2. Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting: VPS hosting involves partitioning a web server into virtual sections that act as independent servers for each hosted website. This offers more control and customization options, as well as improved performance compared to shared hosting. It is suitable for moderately sized websites with increasing traffic levels. 3. Dedicated hosting: With dedicated hosting, a single web server is dedicated exclusively to one website. This high-performance option is ideal for large-scale websites with significant traffic and advanced functionality or security requirements. It allows for total control and customization of the server but is also more expensive. 4. Cloud hosting: This hosting option relies on a network of interconnected servers that work together to host websites, providing flexible resources that can be scaled up or down as needed. Cloud hosting is known for its reliability, as the network can withstand localized server issues without impacting the website's availability. 5. Managed hosting: Managed hosting includes server administration, technical support, and other management services from a hosting provider. This option is beneficial for businesses that lack in-house expertise or resources to maintain and manage their web servers. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and web interfaces are common methods used for uploading and managing website files. FTP is a standard network protocol that enables the transfer of files between a client and a web server, while web interfaces, such as Content Management Systems (CMS), provide a user-friendly, visual way to manage website files and content directly through a browser. In conclusion, while the initially provided answer highlights the essential aspect of web page and file hosting, it is important to recognize the various hosting types and considerations that businesses and individuals must weigh to accommodate their specific website requirements effectively."},{"instruction":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","output":"Certainly! Here's a detailed question with a factual answer: Question: What is the process of photosynthesis and how does it support life on Earth? Answer: Photosynthesis is the biological process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in the form of glucose or other sugars. This process is of vital importance for life on Earth, as it provides a primary source of energy for various ecosystems and releases oxygen gas into the atmosphere as a byproduct, which is essential for aerobic respiration in many organisms. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed primarily by pigments called chlorophyll, which is found in specialized cell structures called chloroplasts in plants and algae. The primary role of chlorophyll is to capture light energy and store it in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Photosynthesis can be divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions, which occur in the presence of light, and the light-independent reactions, which carry on even in the dark or the Calvin Cycle. In the light-dependent reactions, the captured light energy is used to initiate a series of chemical reactions within the chloroplast. These reactions strip electrons from water molecules, producing oxygen as a byproduct. At the same time, the light-dependent reactions generate a flow of high-energy electrons and hydrogen ions that are used to produce ATP and NADPH. The Calvin Cycle, also known as the light-independent reactions or the dark reactions, utilizes the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. This carbon fixation process takes place in the stroma, a fluid-filled area of the chloroplast outside the thylakoids. During the Calvin Cycle, carbon dioxide is combined with a 5-carbon sugar called ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), which is then converted to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). Over several more chemical reactions, this 3-PGA molecule is eventually transformed into the final product of photosynthesis, glucose, which can be used by the plant for immediate energy needs or stored for future use. Photosynthesis supports life on Earth in several ways. Firstly, it serves as the basis of the food chain, providing the energy required for the growth and development of producers (plants and algae). These producers are subsequently consumed by consumers (herbivores and omnivores), which in turn provide energy for higher consumers (carnivores) when consumed. Also, photosynthesis produces oxygen which is essential for aerobic respiration—a process that helps animals survive by releasing energy from their food. Additionally, photosynthesis plays a critical role in maintaining the Earth's oxygen-carbon dioxide balance by keeping the atmosphere's oxygen levels in check and helping to mitigate some of the impacts of human activity on the environment."},{"instruction":"Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Select from: [+] negative.

Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture. But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. What is an answer for this question: Which farm contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water? Answer:","output":"Shallow farm contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water due to its sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural practices. To understand the reasons behind this conclusion, we need to look at the differences in agricultural methods employed by Bold farm and Shallow farm. Bold farm uses a significant amount of fertilizers, which are chemical substances containing essential nutrients that promote plant growth. While these fertilizers can lead to high crop yields, their extensive use has negative consequences on the environment and water systems. On the other hand, Shallow farm uses organic farming methods along with permaculture, which emphasizes sustainability and a harmonious relationship with nature. When rain dissolves fertilizers in the soil, the resulting runoff transports the nutrients, particularly nitrogen, into nearby bodies of water such as ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans. The presence of high levels of nitrogen in water bodies stimulates the rapid growth of algae, a process known as eutrophication. The algae form dense algal blooms that cover the water surface, blocking sunlight and disrupting the aquatic ecosystem. During their growth, algae consume carbon dioxide in the water. However, after they die, decomposers break down the dead algal tissue, using up oxygen in the process. As the decomposition consumes more and more oxygen, oxygen levels in the water decrease. This can create hypoxic conditions, or areas with very low oxygen concentrations, commonly known as dead zones. Dead zones are unable to support most forms of aquatic life, leading to a significant loss of biodiversity and disruption of aquatic ecosystems. Since Bold farm utilizes a large amount of fertilizers, it contributes more significantly to the process of eutrophication, and ultimately to the consumption of oxygen in water bodies. In contrast, Shallow farm, by employing organic farming practices and permaculture, reduces the use of synthetic fertilizers and focuses on maintaining a balance with the natural environment, thus having a lesser impact on oxygen consumption in water bodies. In conclusion, Shallow farm's sustainable agricultural methods contribute less to the consumption of oxygen in the water when compared to Bold farm's fertilizer-intensive approach. Encouraging the adoption of more environmentally friendly farming practices, such as organic farming and permaculture, can help mitigate the negative effects of agriculture on water ecosystems, reduce the formation of dead zones, and promote overall ecological balance."},{"instruction":"Title: Could have been better with some more effort Product review: Maybe it meant to be campy.

The show adapted stock footage from the Japanese TV series \\"Kyry Sentai Zyuranger\\", which was the 16th installment of Toei's \\"Super Sentai\\" franchise. The second and third seasons of the show drew elements and stock footage from \\"Gosei Sentai Dairanger\\" and \\"Ninja Sentai Kakuranger\\", though the \\"Zyuranger\\" costumes were still used for the lead cast. Only the mecha and the Kiba Ranger costume (worn by the White Ranger) were retained from \\"Dairanger\\" for the second season, while only the mecha from \\"Kakuranger\\" were featured in the third season, though the \\"Kakuranger\\" costumes were used for the miniseries \\"Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers\\". The series was produced by MMPR Productions and distributed by Saban Entertainment (later Saban Brands).

The series takes place in a world plagued by Shocker, a mysterious world-wide terrorist organization. To further its plans for world domination, Shocker recruited its agents through kidnapping, turning their victims into mutant cyborgs and, ultimately, brainwashing them. However, one victim named Takeshi Hongo escaped just before the final brainwashing. With his sanity and moral conscience intact, Hongo battled Shocker's minions as the grasshopper-themed superhero Kamen Rider. Another victim of the altered human process, freelance photographer Hayato Ichimonji, became Kamen Rider 2 after Kamen Rider, who renamed himself as \\"Kamen Rider 1\\", saved him from Shocker's brainwashing. Assisted by motorcycle race team manager Tobei Tachibana and FBI agent Kazuya Taki, the Kamen Riders fought in both solo and partnered missions against Shocker and its successor organization, Gel-Shocker.

Find the answer from the choices below. Choices: - fox kids - fuse - history - jimmy - one - science - tv asahi - watch Answer:","output":"TV Asahi"},{"instruction":"Given the question: You are presented with the question \\"What has no backbone?\\" and the following answer choices: - chimp - snail - bats - insects - monkey - sharks - coward - salmon Now knowing that mollusks are invertebrates such as the common snail and an invertebrate is an animal that has no spine, or backbone, choose the best answer. The answer is:","output":"snail. The reason is because snails belong to a group of animals called mollusks, which are invertebrates. Invertebrates are animals that do not have a spine, or backbone. Therefore, snails do not have a backbone. Chimps, bats, monkeys, sharks and salmons, on the other hand, belong to the vertebrates group, indicating that they have a spine or backbone. \\"Coward\\" is a metaphorical term often used to describe someone who lacks the courage to do something. It's not an animal and therefore doesn't classify as having or not having a backbone in a biological sense. It's used in a figurative sense to denote lack of bravery or courage. Insects, although it might seem they lack a backbone due to their small size, they actually belong to a group called arthropods. Arthropods have an exoskeleton, a hard outer structure that provides both structural support and protection. It's not equivalent to a backbone, but it's their form of structural support."},{"instruction":"What is the answer to this question? who built the first plane in the world?","output":"The first airplane in the world was designed, built, and flown by two American brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright. Orville and Wilbur, collectively known as the Wright brothers, were inventors and pioneers in the field of aviation. Their invention of the first successful airplane was a result of years of research, experimentation, and development. Born in 1867 and 1871 respectively, the Wright brothers had a natural curiosity and aptitude for mechanics from a young age. Before delving into the world of aviation, they owned a printing press and, later, a bicycle sales and repair shop. These businesses allowed them to fund their greatest passion: aeronautics. Before the Wright brothers, many inventors and scientists had tried to build a flying machine, but they faced numerous challenges, including designing aircraft that could generate enough lift and maneuver through the air safely. The Wrights were inspired by the works of previous aviation pioneers such as Sir George Cayley, Otto Lilienthal, and Octave Chanute. They were particularly interested in studying the principles of flight control, which they believed was the key to achieving controlled, sustained flight. The Wright brothers' first milestone in the development of the airplane was their invention of a critical flight control system called \\"wing warping.\\" Controlled by the pilot, wing warping adjusted the shape of the wings, allowing the aircraft to bank and turn in response to the pilot's input. Between 1899-1902, they built and tested a series of unmanned gliders to refine their wing warping technique, gather data on lift and drag, and learn more about the effects of wind on an aircraft. They also built a custom wind tunnel to study the properties of airfoils, which led to a greater understanding of aerodynamics and contributed to their aircraft's design. In 1903, the Wright brothers built the first powered airplane, the Wright Flyer. This aircraft utilized a 12-horsepower gasoline engine, a propeller, and their wing warping system. It was constructed from lightweight spruce wood and covered in muslin fabric. On December 17, 1903, the Wright Flyer made its first successful controlled and sustained flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, with Orville as the pilot. The flight lasted just 12 seconds and covered 120 feet, but it marked a monumental leap forward in aviation history. In the years that followed, the Wright brothers continued to refine and develop their aircraft design. They received numerous patents for their inventions and established the world's first civilian flight training school in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1910. In conclusion, the first airplane in the world was designed and built by the Wright brothers—Orville and Wilbur Wright. Their passion for aeronautics, dedication to research and development, and relentless experimentation led to the invention of the first successful airplane and the subsequent development of the aerospace industry, marking a significant turning point in human history and transportation. Today, their legacy continues to inspire engineers, inventors, and dreamers who aspire to push the boundaries of what is possible."},{"instruction":"I can use this background: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor.

The Nationals reached deals with six of their seven arbitration-eligible players on Friday. All but Craig Stammen received one-year deals. Zimmermann was eligible for arbitration for the second time in his career this winter; he was awarded 2.3 million as a Super Two-eligible player following the 2011 season. Friday afternoon was the deadline for teams and arbitration-eligible players’ representatives to exchange salary figures for next season. SFX, the agency which represents Zimmermann, is seeking 5.8 million for next season for the 27-year-old right-hander, but the Nationals have countered with 4.6 million. The two sides are talking, Rizzo said Saturday, with the Nationals hoping to avoid an arbitration hearing, a contentious process that most teams generally prefer to avoid by striking deals. “We’ve proved in the past that we will (go to a hearing) if we have to,” said Rizzo, speaking after Saturdays’ New York Baseball Writers’ Association Dinner where Bryce Harper and Davey Johnson received their end-of-season awards. “We certainly don’t want to. He’s a long-term part of our organization and you hate to go to arbitration with him. But sometimes you have to if the numbers aren’t matched up and you can’t, and they see it one way and we see it the other, you have a third party break the tie.” Zimmermann and Ian Desmond, both important reasons for the Nationals’ success last season and vital pieces of their future, both seem like ideal candidates for multi-year extensions. Both are under team control until 2016. And if both continue to performan well, their salaries will continue to rise in arbitration. Desmond, who had a breakout 2012 season, will early nearly 3.7 million more next season after being eligible for arbitration for the first time in his career this winter. As Friday’s deadline loomed, Rizzo said it’s often easier to first get the one-year deals done for the following season and then consider long-term deals. Rizzo said he spoke with Desmond, 27, during last season about the idea of a contract extension. But Desmond asked to table it until the offseason, wanting to concentrate on the season. Rizzo said he broached the subject of an extension with Zimmermann before the 2012 season but hasn’t revisited the idea with him since. Rizzo said he is open to extensions for both but didn’t say it would definitely happen. “Any long-term deal that makes sense for us to keep component players, we’re definitely open minded about,” he said. Stammen was the only arbitration-eligible Nationals player to agree to a deal beyond one-year, signing a two-year 2.25 million contract that will buy out his first two years of arbitration. The Nationals control Stammen’s rights through 2016, and Rizzo said it was ideal to lock up the versatile, right-handed reliever, who is just 28. “Often times, at that point of a reliever’s career, when they’re first-time eligibles, and you’re talking that kind of money, it’s nice to give them some,” Rizzo said. “It’s the first time in his career he’s really had some security. And we thought he earned it and the numbers made sense for us. It gave us a little cost-certainty. It gave him a little security.” What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the Washington Nationals' efforts to avoid arbitration with their starting pitcher, Jordan Zimmermann, for his 2013 salary. It also covers the possibility of negotiating multi-year deals with both Zimmermann and the team's shortstop, Ian Desmond.

In this particular case, Zimmermann and his agency, SFX, were seeking a salary of 5.8 million for the season while the Nationals offered 4.6 million. The negotiations continued with the hope of avoiding a hearing to settle the dispute. Additionally, the team expressed interest in discussing long-term deals with both Zimmermann and Desmond, who were significant contributors to the Nationals' successful performance in the 2012 season and were considered integral pieces of the team's future.

How should I make some money fast? How can I make fast money?","output":"Let's analyze the two questions: 1) \\"How should I make some money fast?\\" 2) \\"How can I make fast money?\\" In the English language, \\"should\\" and \\"can\\" usually indicate modal verbs that express ability, possibility, permission, or obligation. Here is how they're used in these questions: 1) The first question uses \\"should\\" which typically indicates obligation or correct action from a moral or advisability standpoint. So, this question is seeking advice, perhaps based on the personal circumstances or ethical standards of the person answering. 2) The second question uses \\"can,\\" which typically expresses capability or possibility. This question might be asking about all the possible ways to make money quickly, without necessarily considering the personal or ethical implications. In essence, both questions are intending to seek ways to earn money quickly, but the nuance differs slightly. The first question implies a request for advice or an appropriate, perhaps more ethical, manner of making money quickly. The second question asks more generally and broadly for any possible methods of earning fast money, regardless of other considerations.

The Spanish crown duly passed to the Hapsburgs, and Spain remained in their hands until the feeble-minded Carlos II died in 1700, leaving no heir. France seized the chance to install the young grandson of Louis XIV on the Spanish throne. A rival Hapsburg claimant was supported by Austria and Britain, who saw a powerful Spanish-French alliance as a major threat. In the subsequent War of the Spanish Succession (1702 –1713) most of the old kingdom of Aragón, including the Balearics, backed the Hapsburgs. Britain seized Gibraltar — in the name of the Hapsburg claimant — and retained it when the war was over. In 1708 Britain captured Menorca, and the magnificent harbor of Mahón (Maó), for the Royal Navy. England clung to it even when Bourbon forces captured Mallorca at the end of the war. Menorca changed hands between Britain, France, and Spain five more times in less than a century. Britain finally ceded the island to Spain in the year 1802, under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens. By 1805, Spain was once more aligned with France, and Spanish ships fought alongside the French against Nelson at Trafalgar. Napoleon came to distrust his Spanish ally and forcibly replaced the king of Spain with his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte. A French army marched in to subdue the country. The Spanish resisted and, aided by British troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington, drove the French out. What British historians call the Peninsular War (1808–1814) is known in Spain as the War of Independence. In the 19th century, practically all of Spain’s possessions in the Americas broke away in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, and the few that remained were lost at the end of the 19th century. The Balearics, further neglected, were beset with poverty and outbreaks of disease. However, toward the 20th century, things began to improve on the islands, with Mallorca reaping the rewards of successful agricultural crops and Menorca launching an export shoe industry.

Premise: The film gives the impression that Flynt has none, although he has five--to the best of his knowledge. Hypothesis: The film gives the correct impression of how many of those Flynt has. Available choices: yes, it is not possible to tell, no. First, let's look at the premise. The film suggests that Flynt has none of those (we don't know what \\"those\\" is referring to, but that's irrelevant for our analysis). However, we are told that Flynt has five of those to the best of his knowledge. The hypothesis states that the film is giving the correct impression of how many Flynt has. Since the film suggests Flynt has none and Flynt believes he has five, there seems to be a contradiction. Now, let's evaluate the hypothesis in light of the available choices. 1. Yes: If we choose \\"yes,\\" we are saying that the film is giving the correct impression about how many of those Flynt has.

Mrs. Smith's dog was hungry , but there was not any meat in the house. Considering that there was no better way. Mrs. Smith took a piece of paper, and wrote the following words on it:\\"Give my dog half a pound of meat.\\"Then she gave the paper to her dog and said gently:\\"Take this to the butcher(* person whose job is selling meat)and he's going to give you your lunch today.\\" Holding the piece of paper in its mouth, the dog ran to the butcher's. It gave the paper to the butcher. The butcher read it carefully, recognized that it was really the lady's handwriting and soon did it as he was asked to. The dog was very happy, and ate the meat up at once. At noon, the dog came to the shop again. It gave the butcher a piece of paper again. After reading it, he gave it half a pound of meat once more. The next day, the dog came again exactly at noon. And as usual, it brought a piece of paper in the mouth. This time, the butcher did not take a look at paper, and gave the dog its meat, for he had regarded the dog as one of his customers. But, the dog came again at four o'clock. And the same thing happened once again. To the butcher's more surprise, it came for the third time at six o'clock, and brought with it a third piece of paper. The butcher felt a bit puzzled . He said to himeself,\\"This is a small dog. Why does Mrs. Smith give it so much meat to eat today?\\" Looking at the piece of paper, he found that there were not any words on it! It seemed that the dog knew well that the paper Mrs. Smith gave it _ . A) might do it much harm B) could do it much good C) would help the butcher D) was worth many pounds A:","output":"The best answer is B) could do it much good. In this situation, Mrs. Smith initially gave her dog a piece of paper with the instructions \\"Give my dog half a pound of meat.\\" This piece of paper essentially served as a note or token for the dog to present to the butcher in exchange for its lunch. When the dog handed over the paper to the butcher, he recognized Mrs. Smith's handwriting and gave the dog the meat it requested. As the dog continued to visit the butcher's shop with a piece of paper, the butcher began to see the dog as one of his regular customers. Although the pieces of paper eventually had no words on them, the butcher still provided the dog with the meat it was after. The dog learned that by simply holding a piece of paper in its mouth, it would be given meat. This indicates that the dog knew the piece of paper Mrs. Smith initially gave was beneficial to it and could lead to getting more meat. In this context, the paper represented a form of currency or a bargaining chip that the dog could exchange for something good (meat). It learned that providing the butcher with paper, even if it had no writing on it, benefited it in some way. Therefore, option B) could do it much good would be the most appropriate answer in describing the dog's understanding of the role that the piece of paper played in this situation."},{"instruction":"Consider the question.

The reasoning is that it is nonsensical because a train is typically a large and heavy vehicle that runs on railway tracks, and it cannot be put inside a car which is a relatively smaller vehicle designed to travel on roads. On the other hand, Sentence B makes logical sense, as a dog is a common domestic pet and can be easily placed in a car for transport."},{"instruction":"University of Notre Dame As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

Altogether, in 2006, 744,430 (10%) used mostly English as their home language, and 918,955 (12.2%) comprised the Official Language Minority, having English as their First Official language spoken. When many anglophones relocated outside of Quebec after the introduction of the Charter in the 1970s, several English-language schools in Montreal closed their doors. These school closures may also have been brought about by restrictions on who can attend English schools, which has been another ongoing drain on the English school system.

While it's too soon to know if the technique will help patients live longer, the study is the second small, promising study of cardiac stem cells in three months. The new study involved 25 patients who had suffered very serious heart attacks; 24% of their heart's major pumping chamber had been replaced by scar tissue. One year later, doctors saw no improvement in those randomly assigned to get standard care. Among the 17 given stem cells, however, \\"we reversed about half the injury to the heart,\\" said study author Eduardo Marban, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles, in an e-mail. \\"We dissolved scar and replaced it with living heart muscle.\\" Warren Sherman, director of stem cell research and regenerative medicine at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, says the study was an important proof of the potential of stem cells — harvested from patients, grown in the lab, then injected back into patients' hearts. Doctors don't yet know exactly how the stem cells reduce the size of the dead zone of scar tissue, says Kenneth Margulies, director of heart failure and transplant research at the University of Pennsylvania. And while the shrinking suggests that the stem cells are replacing dead cells with living ones, doctors can't definitely prove that without doing a biopsy of the actual cells, he says. The new study's encouraging results seem to confirm the findings of another small study of heart stem cells, published in The Lancet in November, which also showed an improvement in heart-attack survivors who received the treatment, Margulies says. On the other hand, a third study, found no benefit from stem cells created from patients' own bone marrow. Four stem-cell patients developed serious complications, compared to only one of the other patients, the study says. That suggests stem-cell therapy has a \\"satisfactory\\" safety record, but \\"is not risk-free,\\" Margulies says. The idea of regenerating heart tissue \\"was a pretty far-out idea\\" only 10 to 20 years ago, Margulies says. There's some evidence that heart tissue is capable of making some small repairs on its own, although not enough to help people who've had a heart attack. Marban developed the process of growing heart stem cells while working at Johns Hopkins University, which has filed an application for a patent on the idea and licensed it to a company in which Marban has a financial interest. No money from that company was used to pay for the study, which was funded by Cedars-Sinai and the National Institutes of Health. About 1.3 million Americans have a heart attack each year. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"Imagine your heart is like a toy made of special playdough. When someone has a heart attack, some playdough in their heart gets damaged and turns into a stiff silly putty that doesn't work well. In this news article, scientists have found that special cells called stem cells can help fix the damaged play dough in our hearts. The scientists did a small study with 25 people who had serious heart attacks and lots of bad playdough in their hearts. They used stem cells that they took from the person's own heart, grew in their lab, and then put back in the person's heart. For the people who got these stem cells, the doctors saw that about half of the bad play dough in their hearts turned back into good, working play dough. The doctors don't know exactly how the stem cells fixed the damaged playdough, but they think the cells might replace the bad playdough with good, working playdough. This treatment is still very new and not without risks, so more studies are needed to understand how it works and how safe it is. Overall, this discovery of using stem cells to fix the heart might help millions of people who have heart attacks each year to get better and live longer."},{"instruction":"Here is an email: Mark - Just a few quick notes from yesterday's staff meeting (items you should know about): Enron Direct - Appears to be really ramping up.

Passage: The urinary system, also known as the renal system or urinary tract, consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and the urethra. The purpose of the urinary system is to eliminate waste from the body, regulate blood volume and blood pressure, control levels of electrolytes and metabolites, and regulate blood pH. The urinary tract is the body's drainage system for the eventual removal of urine. The kidneys have an extensive blood supply via the renal arteries which leave the kidneys via the renal vein. Each kidney consists of functional units called nephrons. Following filtration of blood and further processing, wastes (in the form of urine) exit the kidney via the ureters, tubes made of smooth muscle fibres that propel urine towards the urinary bladder, where it is stored and subsequently expelled from the body by urination (voiding). The female and male urinary system are very similar, differing only in the length of the urethra.

They are usually a white dwarf with a companion late sequence red giant. They are indicated by the exhibition of spectral lines of the highly contrasting temperatures of the red giant (~3000 K) and the white dwarf (~20 000 K). The white dwarf gains mass from stellar wind from the red giant or gravitational streaming. - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then: - A white dwarf, also called a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, while its volume is comparable to that of Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name \\"white dwarf\\" was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922. The universe has not existed long enough to experience a white dwarf releasing all of its energy as it will take many billions of years. - Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light. In other words, brightness is the perception elicited by the luminance of a visual target. This is a subjective attribute/property of an object being observed and one of the color appearance parameters of color appearance models. Brightness refers to an absolute term and should not be confused with Lightness. - A red giant is a luminous giant star of low or intermediate mass (roughly 0.38 solar masses) in a late phase of stellar evolution. The outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous, making the radius large and the surface temperature as low as 5,000 K and lower. The appearance of the red giant is from yellow-orange to red, including the spectral types K and M, but also class S stars and most carbon stars. - A binary star is a star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their common barycenter. Systems of two or more stars are called \\"multiple star systems\\". These systems, especially when more distant, often appear to the unaided eye as a single point of light, and are then revealed as multiple by other means. Research over the last two centuries suggests that half or more of visible stars are part of multiple star systems. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - A stellar wind is a flow of gas ejected from the upper atmosphere of a star. It is distinguished from the bipolar outflows characteristic of young stars by being less collimated, although stellar winds are not generally spherically symmetric. - AG Draconis is a binary system consisting of an orange - red giant star and a white dwarf star that revolve around each other every 550 days . It has a baseline apparent magnitude of around 9.8 and flares up to around magnitude 7.3 and is one of the most - studied of symbiotic star systems and its variations in brightness have been observed for 124 years . The outbursts occur every 15 years and last for 3 -- 6 years . The larger star is thought to be an orange giant around 1.5 times as massive as the Sun that has swollen to around 35 times the diameter of the Sun with a spectral type measured at K3IIIep . The smaller star is a compact hot white dwarf around 0.4 times as massive as the Sun , with a surface temperature of around 80,000 K. The star is located in a spherical halo around the Milky Way , and is a nova variable , erupting every 10 -- 15 years . - The apparent magnitude of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter an object appears, the lower its magnitude value (i.e. inverse relation). The Sun, at apparent magnitude of 27, is the brightest object in the sky. It is adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the magnitude scale is logarithmic; a difference of one in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of , or about 2.512. What entity does 'ag draconis' has the relation 'instance of' with? A:","output":"AG Draconis has the relation \\"instance of\\" with the entity \\"symbiotic star system.\\" This is because AG Draconis is a binary system consisting of an orange-red giant star and a white dwarf star that orbit around each other, exhibiting the characteristics of a symbiotic star system."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: Although there are overwhelming social implications , there also seem to be regional financial patterns that perpetuate this trend .

(you can assume what I was doing) I wash my hands and get ready to leave the port-a-pot, and I tried to open the door and it was locked. I’m claustrophobic, so I start to FREAK OUT. I started banging on the door, running into the door with all of my weight. Nothing was helping. I then start crying, I thought for sure that I was going to die. I knew it was the end, at the age of 14, locked in a port-a-pot, in 95 degree weather in the middle of a beach in Georgia. Looking back, i’m curious as to why my family never came to look for me, I was gone for like 30 minutes. So I’m banging on the door continuously, bawling my eyes out. Then a man opened the door for me, from the outside. He was about 6’3 with dreads about 12 inches long and weighed about 280 pounds. I ran out of the port-a-pot and jumped on the guy and gave him a hug and told him that I loved him and that he saved my life.

Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, Jr., respectively. He also served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland. Though he was born in Louisville, Kentucky, Morton moved to a farm on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the early 1950s. In 1962, he was elected to the House of Representatives, in which capacity he established an environmental record. In 1947, Morton spent a great deal of time helping his brother Thruston in his ultimately successful campaign for election to the House of Representatives in Kentucky. After this initial exposure to politics, Morton moved to the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the early 1950s, where he set up a 1,400 acres (5.7 km2) cattle farm along the Wye River in Talbot County. In 1962, Morton decided to challenge Democratic incumbent Thomas Francis Johnson of Maryland's 1st congressional district. Johnson, who was reeling from a political scandal, lost to Morton in the general election. Morton was lauded for not making Johnson's legal troubles his primary campaign issue. Morton was re-elected to Congress four more times, and served from 1963 until 1971. In Congress, Morton worked to enact legislation that would preserve the Chesapeake Bay, including laws reducing pollution into the Bay, working for the creation of a national park on Assateague Island, and providing funds to the Army Corps of Engineers to model how the Bay functions as an estuary. Concerning civil rights, Morton voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but not the Act of 1968. During the 1968 Republican National Convention, Morton served as the floor manager for eventual presidential nominee Richard Nixon. Morton also delivered the speech nominating Spiro Agnew, then-Governor of Maryland, as the vice presidential candidate. Due to his role in Nixon's election campaign and his environmental advocacy, Morton expected to be appointed as Secretary of the Interior in 1969. However, he was passed over for the position in favor of a westerner. He had also been considered for Nixon's vice presidential running mate, but lost out to Agnew. In January 1969, to recognize his efforts, Nixon appointed Morton as chairman of the Republican National Committee. As chairman, Morton was granted ex officio Cabinet rank by Nixon, an unprecedented practice that ultimately continued through the administration of Gerald Ford. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: did he work with anyone else famous?","output":"Yes, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton worked with famous individuals such as President Richard M.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person has done hard physical exercise happens, how will it affect MORE forest formation. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation caused by a person doing hard physical exercise could potentially have both direct and indirect effects on the process of forest formation, although the extent of these effects would greatly depend on the specific circumstances and the individual's actions in relation to the forest ecosystem. Here is a detailed explanation of how this perturbation could influence forest formation: 1. Direct effects: a. Soil Compaction: When a person does hard physical exercise, such as jogging or hiking, in a forested area, this could cause compaction of the soil, especially in the early stages of forest formation. Soil compaction could decrease water infiltration, limit root growth, and reduce nutrient availability for new trees and other plants, potentially slowing down or impeding the formation of forest networks. b. Physical Disturbance: During exercise, the person might inadvertently cause damage to young saplings, break branches, or trample on small plants. These physical disturbances could disrupt the natural progression of forest formation by damaging young trees that are essential for the establishment of tree networks. 2. Indirect effects: a. Dispersal of Seeds and Organisms: The individual exercising in the area could inadvertently help disperse seeds and even small organisms, especially if they are doing the exercise over an extended period of time. This can contribute to the propagation of forest networks and the establishment of new tree communities. b. Introduction of Invasive Species: Conversely, the person could also inadvertently introduce invasive plant species or pathogenic organisms to the area during their physical activity, especially if they have unknowingly brought them along on their clothing or shoes from other regions. Invasive species can outcompete and displace native plants, while pathogenic organisms can cause diseases that can weaken or destroy trees. Both of these factors could negatively affect forest formation. c. Influence on Animal Behavior: The presence of humans during physical exercise could potentially disturb local wildlife populations, altering their behavior and consequently disrupting various ecological processes. For example: if the individual's presence and physical activity causes the native seed dispersers to avoid the area, this could slow down forest formation by reducing the availability of seeds in new locations. d. Enhanced Awareness: On a positive side, the individual engaging in physical exercise in the forest might develop a deeper appreciation for the environment and unique ecosystems, leading them to become more involved in conservation efforts and to advocate for the sustainable management of these ecosystems. This enhanced awareness could indirectly contribute to the conservation of existing forests and support the establishment of new ones. Overall, the perturbation caused by a person doing hard physical exercise in a forest environment can have both positive and negative effects on the process of forest formation. The specific impact will depend on various factors, such as the type and intensity of exercise, the individual's level of environmental awareness, and the unique characteristics of the ecosystem in question."},{"instruction":"I always encourage them to exercise and diet as that is the most healthy and practical solution for me .

Legislative power is vested in the two houses of the Italian Parliament primarily, and secondarily on the Council of Ministers, which can introduce bills and holds the majority in both houses. The judiciary of Italy is independent of the executive and the legislative branches. It is headed by the High Council of the Judiciary, a body presided over by the President of Italy, who is the head of state though his position is separate from all branches. The current Italian President is Sergio Mattarella and the current Prime Minister of Italy is Paolo Gentiloni. What's the best answer to this question: why does italy have both a prime minister and president?","output":"The best answer to the question of why Italy has both a Prime Minister and a President is that their political system is a hybrid of a parliamentary and a semi-presidential system, allowing for a balance of powers between the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches of the government. This dual leadership structure ensures the separation of powers and contributes to maintaining the stability of the political system. 1. Distribution of powers: Having both a Prime Minister and a President allows for a more even distribution of executive responsibilities. While the Prime Minister, as head of the government, focuses on the day-to-day administration and oversees the Council of Ministers, the President, as the head of state, has a more symbolic and unifying role, representing the continuity and stability of the nation. 2. Checks and balances: The presence of both roles in the Italian political system creates a check-and-balance system, preventing any single individual from accumulating too much power. The President holds the power to dissolve the Parliament, appoint the Prime Minister, and has a say in the formation of the government, while the Prime Minister is responsible for steering government policy and holding the confidence of the Parliament. 3. Democratic representation: The President is elected by an electoral assembly, consisting of both houses of Parliament and regional representatives, while the Prime Minister is appointed by the President but must be approved by the Parliament. This ensures that both leaders represent a broad spectrum of political interests and viewpoints, further contributing to the stability of the political system. 4. Stability and continuity: The dual leadership structure lends stability to the Italian political system by ensuring the continuity of the government in case of a parliamentary crisis or the resignation of the Prime Minister. The President can step in to resolve political impasses, ensuring that the government continues to function effectively.

It sounds a little boring, but stick with me, and I'll explain it in a fun way! Once upon a time, in a big place called Europe, there were lots of people who lived in different countries. They wanted to make sure that everyone had enough food to eat, so they decided to work together and create a special plan. This plan is what we call the Common Agricultural Policy or CAP. Now, let's see what the CAP really does. Imagine if there was an enormous farm that covered all of Europe. Each country had its own little part of the farm, growing different foods like potatoes, tomatoes, and even yummy chocolate! The CAP acts like a big rulebook to make sure that all of these farms are growing their food in the best way possible. But, sometimes things can get a little complicated, and that's what we're going to talk about – the CAP's devilish details! It means that some parts of the CAP can be a bit confusing or tricky. 1. Rules, rules, and more rules One tricky part of the CAP is that there are so many rules! Farmers have to follow all of these rules to make sure they are growing their food correctly. Sometimes, these rules can be a bit too much, and it's hard for the farmers to keep track of everything. 2. Money Matters The CAP likes to help farmers by giving them money. The money helps them to grow more food and take care of the environment too. But, deciding who gets how much money can be tricky. Some people think that the big, powerful farmers get too much money and the little, hardworking farmers don't get enough. 3. Green is Good One of the CAP's main goals is to protect the environment. It wants to make sure that the farms are not hurting animals, plants, or the air and water all around them. But some people feel that the CAP isn't doing enough to help the environment. They want the farmers to be even more careful and to use different methods to grow food. 4. Where to Grow? The CAP tells farmers where they should grow their crops. Sometimes, the places that the CAP chooses aren't the best spots for the plants to grow. This can make it harder for farmers to grow enough food to feed everyone. So, there you have it, kids! The CAP is a big plan to help make sure everyone in Europe has enough food to eat and farmers take care of the environment. But, it has some devilish details – some parts that are a bit tricky or confusing. It's essential to keep working on the CAP so that it can help everyone in the best way possible. And who knows, maybe one day you can grow up to be a part of the team to make the CAP even better!"},{"instruction":"Question: - Waste products are deposited in the blood - Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries - The kidneys contain filters inside - The filters capture the waste products - The waste is combined with water to make urine - The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process involves the elimination of urine from the body through the urinary system. After the urine has been collected in the bladder, it needs to be expelled from the body to maintain the balance of water and waste products in our system. Here is a detailed description of the final step in the process: 1. Accumulation of urine in the bladder: As the urine collects in the bladder, it gradually stretches the walls of the bladder, thus increasing the volume of the bladder. The bladder can usually hold around 300 to 600 milliliters of urine, but the urge to urinate typically occurs when it reaches around 200 milliliters. 2. Initiating the micturition reflex: When the bladder becomes filled, specialized stretch receptors present in the bladder wall start to send signals to the spinal cord and brain, indicating that it's time to initiate the complex process of micturition or urination. 3. Response from the brain: Upon receiving these signals, the brain sends signals back to the detrusor muscles that make up the bladder wall. Simultaneously, it sends a message of relaxation to the internal urethral sphincter muscle, which is an involuntary smooth muscle surrounding the opening of the bladder into the urethra. 4. Coordination of muscle and sphincter relaxation and contraction: As the detrusor muscles in the bladder wall contract, the pressure inside the bladder increases, further pushing the urine into the urethra. The relaxation of the internal urethral sphincter muscle also takes place, allowing the urine to enter the urethra. However, the external urethral sphincter, a voluntary muscle under conscious control, must also be voluntarily relaxed for the urine to be expelled from the body. 5. Expulsion of urine: Once these conditions are met – contraction of detrusor muscles, relaxation of the internal urethral sphincter, and relaxation of the external urethral sphincter – the urine can flow out of the body through the urethra. In males, the urethra passes through the prostate gland and penis, while in females, it opens just above the vaginal opening. 6. Completion of the process: After the bladder has been emptied, the detrusor muscles and the internal urethral sphincter return to their resting state, preventing any further flow of urine into the urethra. The external urethral sphincter contracts again, securing the closure of the urethra, and thus, completing the process of urination or micturition. This final step is essential to ensure the effective removal of waste products, toxins, and excess water from the body, maintaining proper kidney function and overall health."},{"instruction":"(Lyhennetty äänestysselitys työjärjestyksen 137 artiklan 1 kohdan mukaisesti.)

But the latest research from Wharton management professor Ethan Mollick sheds light on that bleak outlook and shows that not everyone is in it for the money. In his paper titled, “Filthy Lucre: What Motivates the Commercialization of Innovation,” Mollick posits that financial gain sometimes plays little to no role in the decision making of highly creative people. In fact, the desire to stay out of the market can even smother some people’s career aspirations. Mollick builds his theory around a study of one of the most successful product launches of all time — Apple‘s iPhone. When the long anticipated device was finally released in 2007, many of the technological innovations that developed around it — specifically, novel user applications, or “apps” — were incubated underground, providing an excellent environment to examine the notion that some innovators are motivated by more than material gain. “Part of the reason that the commercialization decision has been understudied is due to the difficulty of finding nascent entrepreneurs and potential innovators before they decide to commercialize,” Mollick writes. “I identified a natural experiment associated with the launch of the iPhone that allowed me to sidestep this problem.” He adds: “This is an especially compelling sample because of the importance of the innovations developed by the individuals in the sample. In addition to eventually starting a number of successful ventures, these innovators developed key new software categories for the iOS platform: the first photography applications, the first games, the first electronic reading applications and many others.” (MORE: The “App Economy” Estimated to Contribute Nearly Half a Million Jobs to the U.S. For the first year after its release, the iPhone was a closed system with proprietary software designed and licensed only by Apple. But almost as soon as the product was on the shelves, hackers were busy developing free, unlicensed software and an underground distribution system for users who wanted to modify their phones. This process, called “jailbreaking,” was done to an estimated 25% of the millions of iPhones sold, Mollick notes, despite the fact that installing outside applications would void the warranty from Apple. A year later, Apple unveiled the second-generation iPhone and a new “app store” to sell applications that were legally developed for the smartphone. The company also invited hackers to go straight by selling their pirated software through the app store. It was a sweet deal for those looking to capitalize on their work. Apple would handle all marketing and distribution, while developers collected 70% of sales revenue. Hackers had three choices: They could continue their commitment to staying underground, update their software under Apple’s watchful eye and commercialize their work through the app store, or abandon their project. “It turns out it’s a complicated dance,” Mollick says. “It’s a lot about freedom. Hackers found [Apple's] closed system bad, but they found Apple [products] elegant. They were motivated by the aesthetic beauty. Innovation is art to these people. So when you dump a bunch of cash on the table, does that change their behavior? For some it does. But you’d be surprised that some do not shift. They leave the cash on the table.” In his paper, Mollick notes that the stakes were high for commercializing: One group of underground developers sold their firm to Walt Disney Company for more than 40 million. “Thus, it would be entirely rational to expect individuals, with almost no opportunity cost and essentially complete products, to pursue commercialization.” Mollick identified 158 “jailbroken” applications for the study and spent several years tracking down the hackers. He found 88 applications were abandoned by the inventor, 35 were kept free and 35 were eventually commercialized. Among the 88 developers, 32 ultimately abandoned their development efforts altogether, 19 continued to develop only free software and 37 commercialized by selling at least one piece of software — including eight developers who created new applications that were sold on Apple’s app store. (MORE: The Price Is Righter: J.C. Penney’s new CEO Tries to Revive the Department Store) The results of the study bolster the argument that some innovators do not respond to economic incentives. For many, innovation is about solving problems, such as a parent who comes up with a novel idea for dealing with picky eaters at dinner time. For others, it’s about creating the best possible product, such as the winery that stays small in order to maintain quality control. And for some, including hackers, the reasoning is far more elusive. “A lot of people sell out when given a chance,” Mollick notes. “But the ones who sell out are not always the ones you’d expect. They are not always the ones who are most innovative.” Mollick says more research in this area could be useful for companies looking for a new approach to the next big thing. What’s important, he notes, is “thinking hard about what motivates people. It’s about understanding who you are trying to talk to and getting them engaged. People are innovating around products all the time. Reaching them is not just about cash; it’s about understanding what these communities want.” Republished with permission from Knowledge@Wharton, the online research and business analysis journal of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

Make this proper case.","output":"On the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, a stack frame is 6 bytes long, except for bus and address errors. The stack frame contains the saved Stack Pointer (SR) at the (A7) address register and the saved Program Counter (PC) at the (2, A7) address register. In order to understand the importance of the stack frame, it is necessary to discuss the concept of the stack, stack pointer, program counter, and address registers in the context of the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. The 68000 microprocessor is a 16/32-bit microprocessor that was widely used in personal computers, gaming consoles, and other applications in the 1980s and 1990s. It featured a 32-bit internal architecture and sixteen 32-bit registers, which were divided into eight data registers and eight address registers. The stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last item added to the stack will be the first item to be removed. In the context of the 68000 microprocessor, the stack is used to store return addresses, local variables, and other temporary data during the execution of a program. The Stack Pointer (SP) or Address Register 7 (A7) is a special address register that points to the top of the stack. When a new item is added to the stack, the stack pointer's value is decreased to account for the new data. When an item is removed from the stack, the stack pointer's value is increased accordingly. The Program Counter (PC) register is responsible for keeping track of the memory address of the instruction currently being executed. During the execution of a subroutine, the program counter's current value is typically saved on the stack, allowing the processor to return correctly to its previous state once the subroutine has completed. In the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, the stack frame is used to save the stack pointer and program counter when an interrupt or subroutine is executed. The 6-byte long structure consists of two parts: the saved Stack Pointer (SR) at the (A7) address register and the saved Program Counter (PC) at the (2, A7) address register. This arrangement allows the processor to restore the correct state upon returning from an interrupt or subroutine. However, for bus and address errors, the stack frame's length is different, as these types of faults require the use of an exception stack frame. The exception stack frame contains additional information to help troubleshoot and recover from the bus or address error. In conclusion, the stack frame is an essential part of the Motorola 68000 microprocessor's architecture, which ensures proper execution flow and management of temporary data during program execution. By understanding the stack frame's structure and its role in the system, programmers can write more efficient and effective code for the 68000 microprocessor."},{"instruction":"Produce a detailed sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = Strada, eatType = restaurant, food = Chinese, priceRange = cheap, customer rating = 5 out of 5, familyFriendly = no, near = Rainbow Vegetarian Café Sentence:","output":"Strada, a cheap Chinese restaurant with an impressive 5 out of 5 customer rating, offers a non-family-friendly dining experience near the Rainbow Vegetarian Café."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians NUMBER_OF_PAGES \\"320\\"; Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians OCLC_NUMBER 78771100; Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians MEDIA_TYPE \\"Print\\"; Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians ISBN_NUMBER \\"0-439-92550-9\\"","output":"In Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians, a 320-page print book with OCLC number 78771100, the ISBN is 0-439-92550-9."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a 4-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.wordpress.android.

The app offers a fantastic experience for managing my blog while on-the-go - updating articles, publishing blog posts, and keeping track of comments have never been easier. The user interface is intuitive, well-designed, and visually appealing. The app's performance is generally fast, making for a seamless blogging experience even on older smartphones. I also appreciate the availability of a wide range of customization options, making it easier to maintain a consistent blog design across all platforms. However, there are areas where the app could be further improved. Sometimes when editing or uploading media, image positioning and formatting can be a bit clunky. It would be great if the developers could optimize the app for better handling of such issues. Additionally, the app's notifications can be erratic at times, delivering notifications with delays or not at all. Enhancing the performance of notifications would make tracking comments and updates much more efficient for users. Lastly, I noticed that the app's autosave feature could use some enhancements, as certain text format changes or edits occasionally get lost if the app accidentally crashes or is closed.

Then afterwards, McMahon would make his famous thirty-year mark as Carson's sidekick, announcer and second banana on NBC's highly successfully The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson from 1962 to 1992. His long association with brewer Anheuser-Busch earned him the nickname \\"Mr. Budweiser\\" and he used that relationship to bring them aboard as one of the largest corporate donors to the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Since 1973, McMahon served as co-host of the long-running live annual Labor Day weekend event of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. His 41st and final appearance on that show was in 2008, making him second only to Jerry Lewis himself in number of appearances. McMahon and Dick Clark hosted the television series (and later special broadcasts of) TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes on NBC from 1982 to 1998, when Clark decided to move production of the series to ABC. In 1967, McMahon had a role in the film The Incident and appeared as Santa Clause on The Mitzi Gaynor Christmas Show. From 1965 to 1969, McMahon served as \\"communicator\\" (host) of the Saturday afternoon segment of Monitor, the weekend news, features and entertainment magazine on the NBC Radio Network. The 1955 movie Dementia, which has music without dialogue, was released as Daughter of Horror in 1970. The newer version, which had a voice over by McMahon, still has music without dialogue, but with an added narration read by him. McMahon had a supporting role in the original Fun with Dick and Jane in 1977. He then played himself in \\"Remote Control Man\\", a season one episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories.

The Moon thus tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally. As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to \\"catch up\\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height.

But at the moment young peoples views are easily ignored by those in power because they dont have the vote . 8. The vote for 16-18 year olds would help redress the growing age imbalance which is occurring as a result of aging .","output":"Based on the provided pieces of evidence, the claim that can be made is: Lowering the voting age to 16 would contribute to a more balanced representation of society's interests, particularly addressing the age imbalance due to an aging population, and ensuring that young people's voices are heard and taken into account in policy-making decisions. This claim is supported by the following points: 1. The evidence suggests that policies on education, such as student loans, would have to consider the views and interests of 16-18-year-olds if they were given the right to vote. This implies that currently, the interests of this age group may not be sufficiently prioritized in policy-making decisions. 2. The argument that 16-year-olds are well-educated and media-savvy indicates that they possess the ability to express informed opinions on political matters. This suggests that their perspectives could contribute valuable insights to the democratic process if they are granted the right to vote. 3. The notable difference in how young people and the elderly are treated, as mentioned in the evidence, highlights the existing disparity between age groups in both society and politics. Extending voting rights to 16-18-year-olds would help bridge this gap. 4. Providing the vote to teenagers would ensure that politicians take their opinions and interests seriously, leading to greater accountability in political decisions affecting this age group. 5. The projected increase in pensioners and those aged 80 and above by 2050 points to an aging population in the rich world. This demographic shift will likely lead to a growing focus on the interests of older citizens in politics. 6. The assertion that older voters will prioritize their benefits at the expense of the young further emphasizes the need for young people's voices to be represented in politics. Granting 16-18-year-olds the right to vote would help counterbalance this potential bias. 7. The fact that young people's views are easily ignored by those in power due to their lack of voting rights highlights the necessity of addressing this issue in order to create a more inclusive and fair political process. 8. Finally, allowing 16-18-year-olds to vote would contribute to redressing the age imbalance occurring as a result of an aging population. This change would ensure that different age groups' interests are represented and considered equally in political decisions. In conclusion, the evidence supports the claim that lowering the voting age to 16 would result in a more balanced and inclusive political landscape that takes into account the interests and opinions of all age groups, especially in an aging society."},{"instruction":"Choices: [A]. tides. [B]. Magnetic pull. [C]. Gravity. [D]. winds. Q: Q: What is the cause of most ocean waves? A: A:","output":"The cause of most ocean waves is [D]. winds. Winds generate most ocean waves by transferring their energy into the water. As the wind blows across the ocean surface, it creates friction that leads to ripples or waves. These waves can travel vast distances and grow in size as they gain more energy. The stronger and more persistent the wind, the larger and more powerful the waves will become. While other factors like tides (caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun), magnetic pull, and gravity can influence oceanic movements, they are not the primary cause of most ocean waves. Tides, for example, cause periodic changes in sea level, which can result in tidal currents but not typical ocean waves."},{"instruction":"What key details about peter campus can be extracted from the following bio?

It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - Country pop is a subgenre of country music and pop music that was developed by members of the Country genre out of a desire to reach a larger, mainstream audience. By producing country songs that employed many styles and sounds found in pop music, the country music industry was effective in gaining new listeners without alienating its traditional country audience. It is a continuation of similar efforts that began in the late 1950s originally known as Nashville sound and later on Countrypolitan. By the mid-1970s, many country artists were transitioning to the pop-country sound which led to some records charting high on mainstream top 40 as well as country \\"Billboard\\" charts. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - I 'm Leaving It All Up to You is the debut album by Donny & Marie Osmond , released in 1974 . Two singles were released from the album : \`\` I 'm Leavin ' It ( All ) Up to You '' ( US Pop # 4 , Country # 17 ) and \`\` Morning Side of the Mountain '' ( US Pop # 8 ) . - Donald Clark \\"Donny\\" Osmond (born December 9, 1957) is an American singer, actor, radio personality, and former teen idol. Osmond has also been a talk and game show host, record producer and author. In the mid-1960s, he and four of his elder brothers gained fame as the Osmonds. Osmond went solo in the early 1970s, covering such hits as \\"Go Away Little Girl\\" and \\"Puppy Love\\". - A doll is a model of a human being, often used as a toy for children. Dolls have traditionally been used in magic and religious rituals throughout the world, and traditional dolls made of materials such as clay and wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe. The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome. The use of dolls as toys was documented in Greece around 100 AD. They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, going back to the 15th century. With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced. During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles. - Olive Marie Osmond (born October 13, 1959) is an American singer, actress, doll designer, and a member of the show business family the Osmonds. Although she was never part of her family's singing group, she gained success as a solo country music artist in the 1970s and 1980s. Her best known song is a cover of the country pop ballad \\"Paper Roses\\". From 1976 to 1979, she and her singer brother Donny Osmond hosted the television variety show \\"Donny & Marie\\". - · \\"Paper Roses\\" is a popular song written and composed by Fred Spielman and Janice Torre. It first was a top five hit in 1960 for Anita Bryant with Monty Kelly's Orchestra and Chorus. Marie Osmond later covered it in 1973 and took her version to number one on the US country chart. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. - The Osmonds are an American family music group with a long and varied career a career that took them from singing barbershop music as children to achieving success as teen-music idols, from producing a hit television show to continued success as solo and group performers. The Osmonds are devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and their religious values have influenced their careers. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'performer' with 'donny osmond'.

In the past the term \\"insect\\" was more vague, and historically the definition of entomology included the study of terrestrial animals in other arthropod groups or other phyla, such as arachnids, myriapods, earthworms, land snails, and slugs. This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use. Like several of the other fields that are categorized within zoology, entomology is a taxon-based category; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is, by definition, entomology. Entomology therefore overlaps with a cross-section of topics as diverse as molecular genetics, behavior, biomechanics, biochemistry, systematics, physiology, developmental biology, ecology, morphology, and paleontology. At some 1.3 million described species, insects account for more than two-thirds of all known organisms, date back some 400 million years, and have many kinds of interactions with humans and other forms of life on earth. Entomology is rooted in nearly all human cultures from prehistoric times, primarily in the context of agriculture (especially biological control and beekeeping), but scientific study began only as recently as the 16th century. William Kirby is widely considered as the father of Entomology. In collaboration with William Spence, he published a definitive entomological encyclopedia, \\"Introduction to Entomology\\", regarded as the subject's foundational text. He also helped to found the Royal Entomological Society in London in 1833, one of the earliest such societies in the world; earlier antecedents, such as the Aurelian society date back to the 1740s.

Dean was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election. His implementation of the fifty-state strategy as head of the DNC is credited with the Democratic victories in the 2006 and 2008 elections. Afterward, he became a political commentator and consultant to McKenna Long & Aldridge, a law and lobbying firm. Dean graduated from Yale University with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1971. As a freshman, he requested specifically to room with an African-American. The university housing office complied and Dean roomed with two Southern black students and one white student from Pennsylvania. One of Dean's roommates was Ralph Dawson, the son of a sheet metal worker in Charleston, South Carolina and today a New York City labor lawyer. Dawson said of Dean: Unless you operated from a stereotypic understanding of the Yale white boy as rich, you wouldn't know that about Howard.... When it came to race- and I don't know whether this was a function of intent or just came naturally- Howard was not patronizing in any way. He was willing to confront in discussion what a lot of white students weren't. He would hold his ground. He would respect that I knew forty-two million times more about being black than he did. But that didn't mean he couldn't hold a view on something relating to civil rights that would be as valid as mine. There were lots of well-meaning people at Yale who wanted you to understand that they understood your plight; you'd get into a conversation and they would yield too soon, so we didn't get the full benefit of the exchange. Howard very much thought he was capable of working an issue through. He was inquisitive. And when he came to a conclusion he would be as strong as anybody else. I don't think he's stubborn. He's a guy who's always been comfortable in his own skin. That's something you still see in him today, and it gets him into some degree of controversy. Though eventually eligible to be drafted into the military, he received a deferment for an unfused vertebra. He explained to Tim Russert on Meet the Press, \\"I was really in no hurry to join the military.\\" He briefly tried a career as a stockbroker before deciding on a career in medicine, completing pre-medicine classes at Columbia University.

More thunderstorms may create stronger areas of low pressure, leading to greater rotation and enhancing the organization of the developing hurricane. Effect: More Step 3: Several thunderstorms come together around this area. As more thunderstorms merge and interact, they can produce stronger updrafts and downdrafts, further enhancing the organization of the hurricane. Effect: More Step 4: The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating. More thunderstorms mean that more warm, moist air will be available to fuel the hurricane. This could result in a more powerful hurricane as it feeds off the available energy. Effect: More Step 5: When the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is considered a hurricane.

Fact 2: Oxygenated blood is red, deoxygenated blood is blue. Given the two facts above, veins generally carry what type of blood? A:","output":"Veins generally carry deoxygenated blood. Let's break this down and delve deeper into this. Fact 1, as stated, is that veins generally carry deoxygenated blood. This is generally correct with some exceptions. To understand this, let's have a look at the circulatory system. In the human body, our circulatory system is essentially a vast network of blood vessels including arteries, veins, and capillaries. The circulatory system transports blood around the body, supplying cells with the nutrients and oxygen they require while also removing waste products. This system is powered by the heart, which acts as a pump. The blood's journey usually starts at the heart, rich in oxygen, and it gets pumped into arteries. Arteries carry this oxygen-rich blood to various parts of the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients. On the other hand, veins are the blood vessels responsible for carrying blood toward the heart. This blood carried by veins, having delivered its oxygen, is now generally deoxygenated, which is why we say that veins generally carry deoxygenated blood. However, an important exception to this is the pulmonary veins. Pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs back to the heart, ready to be pumped back into the arteries. Fact 2 states that oxygenated blood is red, and deoxygenated blood is blue. However, this statement is partially incorrect. In reality, deoxygenated blood is not blue; it's a deeper, darker red. This common misconception likely stems from the way veins appear blue or green underneath the skin. This is because only blue light can penetrate the skin deep enough to illuminate the veins. To conclude, given the facts and taking into account the corrections required to Fact 2, veins generally carry deoxygenated blood. The blood is not blue but instead is a darker shade of red due to the lack of oxygen. The exception to this statement is the pulmonary veins, which carry oxygenated blood from the lungs back to the heart."},{"instruction":"Answer this question. Bisected by Minnesota Glacier to form the northern Sentinel Range and the southern Heritage Range, which is the highest mountain in Antarctica?","output":"The highest mountain in Antarctica, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier to form the northern Sentinel Range and the southern Heritage Range, is Mount Vinson. Named in honor of the American Congressman Carl Vinson, who supported the research and exploration of Antarctica, Mount Vinson is part of the Vinson Massif, a mountain range located within the broader Ellsworth Mountains. Rising to an elevation of 16,050 feet (4,892 meters) above sea level, Mount Vinson was first discovered in 1958, although the Ellsworth Mountains' existence had been confirmed earlier in 1935 by the American geographer and explorer Lincoln Ellsworth. Despite its relatively recent discovery, Mount Vinson is considered among one of the Seven Summits, constituting the highest peaks on each continent. The first successful ascent of Mount Vinson took place on December 18, 1966, by a team of American climbers led by Nicholas B. Clinch. Since then, various expeditions have been carried out, and climbing the peak has become a popular goal for mountaineers. Mount Vinson's environment and conditions are extremely harsh, with temperatures plummeting as low as -50°F (-45°C) and winds reaching up to 50 miles per hour (80 kilometers per hour). The mountain is covered with ice and snow all year round due to Antarctica's location in the South Polar Region. Because of its remote and isolated location, accessing Mount Vinson involves a challenging and costly logistical effort, typically involving air travel to and from Punta Arenas, Chile, to the Union Glacier Camp in Antarctica, followed by additional flights to the Vinson Base Camp. Besides the notable achievement for climbers and the challenging logistics associated with summiting Mount Vinson, the region contributes to valuable scientific research as it provides essential data for understanding climate change, geological processes, and the unique ecosystems that have adapted to some of the planet's most extreme conditions."},{"instruction":"Give the step-by-step reasoning process and then the final answer.

While moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to interfere with many common antibiotics, there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol consumption may cause serious side-effects. Therefore, potential risks of side-effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered. Despite the lack of a categorical counterindication, the belief that alcohol and antibiotics should never be mixed is widespread.\\" Answer: A:","output":"In most cases, small doses of alcohol do not significantly affect a person on antibiotics. However, the specific interaction between alcohol and an antibiotic, as well as its subsequent impact on the individual, depends largely on the type of antibiotic being used and the individual's physiological response to it. To better understand this relationship, it is important to recognize the various aspects of alcohol consumption and its potential impact on antibiotics. Firstly, the metabolism of alcohol takes place predominantly in the liver. Consequently, certain medications, such as antibiotics, are also metabolized in the liver, which means that alcohol consumption could potentially interfere with the metabolism of these drugs. Generally, moderate alcohol intake does not significantly hinder the effectiveness of most common antibiotics; nevertheless, there are exceptions. There are specific antibiotics where alcohol consumption can lead to severe side effects, which also applies to smaller doses. These antibiotics include: 1. Metronidazole: This antibiotic is often used to treat bacterial infections in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts. Alcohol consumption while taking metronidazole can trigger a disulfiram-like reaction, causing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headache, rapid heartbeat, and flushing, among others. This is due to the medication's interference with the alcohol metabolism, leading to a buildup of a harmful substance called acetaldehyde in the body. 2. Tinidazole: Similar to metronidazole, tinidazole is prescribed for various bacterial and parasitic infections. Consumption of alcohol while taking tinidazole can also induce a disulfiram-like reaction, resulting in the unpleasant side effects mentioned above. 3. Linezolid: This antibiotic is prescribed for serious bacterial infections, including those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Mixing linezolid with alcohol can lead to enhanced side effects such as dizziness, headache, and increased blood pressure, which are due to a potential interaction with tyramine content in alcoholic beverages. 4. Isoniazid: Used primarily for treating tuberculosis, this antibiotic can cause liver damage, and the risk of liver toxicity increases with alcohol consumption. Even small doses of alcohol can increase the risk when taking isoniazid. While the belief that alcohol and antibiotics should never be mixed is widespread, it is essential to acknowledge that not all antibiotics are adversely affected by the consumption of small doses of alcohol. However, given the potential risks associated with specific antibiotic types and individual physiological responses, it is generally advised to avoid alcohol during antibiotic treatment to prevent potentially serious side effects and reduced effectiveness of antibiotic therapy. In conclusion, small doses of alcohol generally do not significantly affect a person on most types of antibiotics. Yet, some antibiotics do exhibit severe side effects or a decrease in effectiveness when mixed with even small amounts of alcohol. As a precaution, it is advisable to abstain from alcohol while undergoing antibiotic treatment to ensure the utmost efficacy and safety during the healing process. Consultation with healthcare professionals is recommended to discuss the implications of any potential interactions between alcohol and a prescribed antibiotic."},{"instruction":"UNMIK başkanı Soren Jessen-Petersen (sağda) ile Kosova Başbakanı Bayram Kosumi eyalette etnik bölünme olmayacağını söylediler.

He was a famous hunter. He often went hunting alone in the mountains. He was not afraid of any wild animals, not even a tiger. One night, someone saw a tiger come into the village, and stole two sheep away. The next night the tiger came again. The villagers were frightened. They asked the old hunter to catch it so that they could have a safe life. When the old man heard about the tiger, he thought hard. He wondered why the tiger came at night twice but only stole the sheep. The next night he walked outside the village. Suddenly he saw the tiger coming. He quickly threw himself on the ground. To his surprise, the tiger did not come at him, but went away. He followed it quietly and found it was running on two of its feet just like a man. Then everything was clear. On the fourth day, when it got dark, the hunter took some animal skins with him and hid himself behind a big tree near the village. He was waiting for the \\"tiger\\".

Which area experiences more soil erosion? The Gorge saw some negative effects due to deforestation. The Valley has a more fertile soil, it's not overgrazed, and the trees and bushes are abundant, and the productivity has increased several fold over the past decade. Biodiversity in the Valley is varied, and the soils are nutritious and retain more water, nitrogen and carbon. Hint: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.

Options: - headaches - bigger brain - education - growth - knowing more Please answer and provide answer explanation.","output":"With more learning, your knowledge will experience growth, and you will end up knowing more. The process of education helps you acquire new information, ideas, and skills which contribute to your intellectual development and the expansion of your knowledge base. When exposed to new learning experiences or material, your brain undergoes a process called neuroplasticity. This process involves the creation and strengthening of new neural pathways, allowing the brain to adapt, change, and better absorb new information. You do not necessarily develop a bigger brain physically, but it becomes more efficient and effective at processing and storing new information. Headaches, while they can be experienced due to various factors like stress or fatigue, are not a direct result of acquiring more knowledge. It's crucial to focus on learning at a comfortable pace and take care of your overall health. In summary, with more learning, your knowledge will grow, and you will become more educated and well-informed."},{"instruction":"Here is a goal: how do you take a picture using the iphone camera?

On the Jets' next play from scrimmage, Chad Pennington was intercepted by Artrell Hawkins. Two plays later, Tom Brady found Doug Gabriel open downfield for a long first down, but Victor Hobson forced a fumble and Kerry Rhodes recovered. The Jets followed with a time-consuming 16-play, 9:12 drive, capped off by a two-yard Kevan Barlow touchdown run for a 7-3 Jets lead. New England battled downfield, converting a 4th-and-1 from their own 44 with a run to fullback Heath Evans, and on the first play after the two-minute warning, Brady appeared to be intercepted by Drew Coleman, who ran the ball back 35 yards. But, the play was negated on a controversial roughing-the-passer call on Hobson, who dove at Brady as he was releasing the ball, but drove him into the ground, prompting the flag. The Patriots then converted on a 4th-and-3 from the Jets' 24, but settled for a 21-yard field goal from Gostkowski with four seconds left. Justin Miller ran back the opening kickoff of the second half 62 yards, and the drive ended with Pennington lining up in the shotgun on 4th-and-5 from the Patriots' 33, only to punt the ball to the New England 4. After a Patriots punt, Pennington led the Jets on another long drive, this one 15 plays and only 45 yards, but it ate 6:40 off the clock and resulted in Nugent's 34-yard field goal. Midway through the fourth quarter, Brady was intercepted by Erik Coleman, and Pennington tossed a 22-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery, barely keeping his feet inbounds, although the play was never challenged. The Jets led 17-6 with 4:51 to go. However, operating out of a no-huddle offense, Brady led the Patriots 61 yards in 31 seconds, capped by a 15-yard touchdown pass to Reche Caldwell, and Brady found Caldwell again on the two-point conversion to narrow the lead to 17-14. But the next drive was critical, as the Jets forced New England to use all three timeouts, punting with 1:15 to go.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city released less livestock waste into the ocean? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can infer that Pine city would likely release less livestock waste into the ocean. The paragraph does not mention that Pine city is involved in any form of agriculture, let alone that it uses livestock in a way that would result in waste being released into the ocean. The city is described as being located in the mountains, inhabited mostly by nature lovers and environmental protectors. This suggests the inhabitants would be more cautious about actions that could harm the environment. On the other hand, Bird city is situated on the banks of a large river that flows directly into the sea. The city relies on conventional agriculture, which could include the use of livestock. The use of fertilizers also implies that their farming practices are more intensive and potentially less environmentally friendly.

In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - Gulls, often referred to as seagulls, are seabirds of the family Laridae in the suborder Lari. They are most closely related to the terns (family Sternidae) and only distantly related to auks, skimmers, and more distantly to the waders. Until the 21st century, most gulls were placed in the genus \\"Larus\\", but this arrangement is now known to be polyphyletic, leading to the resurrection of several genera. An older name for gulls is mew, cognate with German \\"Möwe\\", Danish \\"måge\\", Dutch \\"meeuw\\", and French \\"mouette\\"; this term can still be found in certain regional dialects. - The black tern ( Chlidonias niger or Chlidonias nigra ) is a small tern generally found in or near inland water in Europe and North America . As its name suggests , it has predominantly dark plumage . In some lights it can appear blue in the breeding season , hence the old English name \`\` blue darr '' . The scientific name means \`\` like a swallow '' . - The swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family Hirundinidae that are characterised by their adaptation to aerial feeding. \\"Swallow\\" is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the barn swallow. - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Terns are seabirds in the family Sternidae that have a worldwide distribution and are normally found near the sea, rivers, or wetlands. Previously considered a subfamily of the gulls, Laridae, they are now usually given full family status and divided into eleven genera. They are slender, lightly built birds with long, forked tails, narrow wings, long bills, and relatively short legs. Most species are pale grey above and white below, with a contrasting black cap to the head, but the marsh terns, the Inca tern, and some noddies have dark plumage for at least part of the year. The sexes are identical in appearance, but young birds are readily distinguishable from adults. Terns have a non-breeding plumage, which usually involves a white forehead and much-reduced black cap. - The name marsh tern refers to terns of the genus \\"Chlidonias\\", which are typically found in freshwater marshes, rather than coastal locations. The genus name \\"Chlidonias\\" is from Ancient Greek \\"khelidonios\\", \\"swallow-like\\", from \\"khelidon\\", \\"swallow\\". - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Inca tern (\\"Larosterna inca\\") is a seabird in the family Sternidae. It is the only member of the genus \\"Larosterna\\". - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Plumage (\\"feather\\") refers both to the layer of feathers that cover a bird and the pattern, colour, and arrangement of those feathers. The pattern and colours of plumage differ between species and subspecies, and may vary with age classes. Within species there can be different colour morphs. - The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about . - The barn swallow (\\"Hirundo rustica\\") is the most widespread species of swallow in the world. It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In Anglophone Europe it is just called the swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a \\"swallow\\" rather than a \\"martin\\". - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - A wetland is a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally, such that it takes on the characteristics of a distinct ecosystem. The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from other land forms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants, adapted to the unique hydric soil. Wetlands play a number of roles in the environment, principally water purification, flood control, carbon sink and shoreline stability. Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life.

It seems that their fattest hamster, Shelley, has lost 3 ounces, proving that the serum works. Jason suggests increasing the amount Shelley is fed, but the ever-kindly Sherman argues against it, saying it could be dangerous.He then has an unpleasant meeting with Dean Richmond (Larry Miller). The Dean tells him that the incident with the hamsters has cost the science department most of its funding. Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is the school's last remaining wealthy alumnus and is planning to award a 10 million grant to the college; Klump is warned not to alienate him as well.After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with the lovely Miss Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett), a chemistry graduate student teaching a class across the hall, who is a big fan of his work.

The World health Organization (WHO) observes that the introduction of air conditioning and energy conservation measures have been accompanied by growing problems of indoor air quality. Some pollutants arise from insulation products, some from moving cars, and others from modern housing materials. As many Europeans spend up to 90% of their lives in buildings, the health effects of the indoor climate are very important. Some construction materials, including fiberboard, insulation foams and certain glues for man-made wood floor boards, for example, give out organic products such as formaldehyde . Heat and humidity increase the release of formaldehyde and the gas seriously harms the eyes. Paint, lacquer, etc. can also release dangerous gas into indoor air. Construction materials can cause serious damage, especially when they contain asbestos . Asbestos is naturally present in rock formations worldwide. It belongs to a family of mineral substances made up of solid, non-combustible fiber. These properties make asbestos a highly sought-after construction material. As early as 1931, however, public health officers in the prefix = st1 /United Kingdomrevealed the connection between breathing in asbestos dust and such diseases as lung cancer. The land on which a building is sited may also contribute to pollution. Some kinds of granite or similar rocks contain traces of radium. As it breaks down, this naturally radioactive element produces some kind of radioactive gas that goes through tiny cracks in walls, floors and building materials, and makes its way into the building and the rooms. The better the homes are insulated, the more is the dangerous gas in indoor air. The main effect of this dangerous gas on health is to increase the risk of lung cancer. Why is asbestos a sought-after building material? A) It is a kind of insulation foam. B) Asbestos will not give out dangerous gas. C) This material is not easy to catch fire. D) It is rarely present in rock formations.","output":"Asbestos is a sought-after building material because C) This material is not easy to catch fire.

He has sometimes been incorrectly referred to as James Danforth Quayle III. In his memoirs, he points out that his birth name was simply James Danforth Quayle. The name Quayle originates from the Isle of Man, where his great-grandfather was born. Quayle became an investigator for the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Indiana Attorney General in July 1971. Later that year, he became an administrative assistant to Governor Edgar Whitcomb. From 1973 to 1974, he was the Director of the Inheritance Tax Division of the Indiana Department of Revenue. Upon receiving his law degree, Quayle worked as associate publisher of his family's newspaper, the Huntington Herald-Press. In 1976, Quayle was elected to the House of Representatives from Indiana's 4th congressional district, defeating eight-term incumbent Democrat J. Edward Roush by a 55%-to-45% margin. He won reelection in 1978 by the greatest percentage margin achieved to date in that northeast Indiana district. In 1980, at age 33, Quayle became the youngest person ever elected to the Senate from the state of Indiana, defeating three-term incumbent Democrat Birch Bayh by taking 54% of the votes to Bayh's 46%. Making Indiana political history again, Quayle was re-elected to the Senate in 1986 with the largest margin ever achieved to that date by a candidate in a statewide Indiana race, taking 61% of the vote and defeating his Democratic opponent, Jill Long. In November 1978, Quayle was invited by Congressman Leo Ryan of California to accompany him on a delegation to investigate unsafe conditions at the Jonestown settlement in Guyana, but Quayle was unable to participate. The decision likely saved Quayle's life, because Ryan and his entourage were subsequently murdered at the airstrip in Jonestown as the party tried to escape the massacre. In 1986, Quayle was criticized for championing the cause of Daniel Anthony Manion, a candidate for a federal appellate judgeship, who was in law school one year above Quayle. The American Bar Association had evaluated Manion as \\"qualified/unqualified\\", its lower passing grade. Manion was nominated for the Seventh Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals by President Ronald Reagan on February 21, 1986, and confirmed by the Senate on June 26, 1986.

Sir William Turner Walton, OM (29 March 1902 – 8 March 1983) was an English composer. During a sixty-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include Façade, the cantata Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation anthems Crown Imperial and Orb and Sceptre. Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score. In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works. Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.

Unplug the earbuds from any devices. 2. Gently remove any ear tips or cushions. 3. Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe the exterior of the earbuds. 4. Use a dry cotton swab or soft-bristled toothbrush to clean around the edges and through any grills or openings. 5. Dampen a cloth or cotton swab with rubbing alcohol, and gently clean the metal or plastic connections or any tougher-to-remove debris. 6. Allow the earbuds to dry completely before reassembling and using them. Solution 2: 1. Unplug the earbuds from any devices. 2. Run the earbuds under warm water to loosen any dirt or earwax. 3. Use a soft toothbrush or cotton swab to scrub around the edges and through any grills or openings. 4. Hold the earbuds with the speakers facing down, so any excess water can drain out. 5. Dry the earbuds with a hairdryer on a low setting, with the speakers facing down. 6. Allow the earbuds to dry completely before reassembling and using them. In terms of naive physics reasoning, Solution 1 is more sound. Here's why: 1. Solution 1 avoids using water altogether, thus reducing the risk of damage to electronic components in the earbuds. Instead, it uses a soft, dry cloth, and rubbing alcohol to gently clean the earbuds. 2. Using a soft-bristled toothbrush or cotton swab in Solution 1 ensures precision and gentleness while cleaning the edges and grills of the earbuds, whereas running them under water in Solution 2 could forcefully push dirt or earwax further into the earbuds. 3. Allowing the earbuds to air dry in Solution 1 reduces the risk of heat damage compared to using a hairdryer in Solution 2, which could potentially harm the earbuds' components. Overall, Solution 1 is more careful, gentle, and precise in its approach to cleaning earbuds, making fewer assumptions about the earbuds' tolerance for water and heat."},{"instruction":"Spiric's resignation means that the BiH government is now in a technical mandate, Lajcak said on Thursday, explaining that the cabinet remains responsible for ensuring that the administration continues to function.

Next to that house , they 're just finishing a new apartment building . As I walked by the house , I realized I had n't seen the dog in at least a month . The quiet 's been nice . Answer the following question: Why would the narrator be so happy to be around quiet ?","output":"The narrator might be happy to be around quiet for several reasons. Firstly, constant exposure to noise, such as the barking dog, can be physically and mentally exhausting. Noise pollution has been linked to adverse health effects, including stress, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and even cardiovascular issues. When they realize that they haven't seen or heard the dog in a month, the quiet is a reminder of the relief from the constant noise they had experienced before. Secondly, being around quiet can lead to increased focus and productivity in daily life. When the mind is not distracted by outside noise, it is more capable of concentrating on tasks that require cognitive processing, problem-solving, and planning. The quiet environment presents a sense of peace and tranquility that enables the narrator to function better in their daily life. Thirdly, the quiet may also represent a shift in the neighborhood environment or dynamics. With the new apartment building being constructed, there could be potential changes to the community in terms of demographics, culture, and activities. The absence of the dog's barking may symbolize the evolution of the neighborhood into something more refined and agreeable to the narrator. Another factor could be the narrator's personality and personal preferences. It is possible that they are an introvert, a highly sensitive person (HSP), or someone who simply has a lower tolerance for noise. People with these traits often feel overwhelmed by loud and continuous noise, making them crave quiet environments where they can recharge and feel at ease. The realization that they haven't seen the dog in a month might signify that the narrator's peace has been restored, thus improving their overall mood and well-being. Lastly, the quiet may be the result of the narrator's adaptation to the noise. It is possible that the dog's continued barking over time has led the narrator to consciously or subconsciously repress the noise. In this case, realizing that they haven't seen the dog in a month might come as a pleasant surprise, as they had grown accustomed to the noise and were no longer actively bothered by it. The quiet, then, has become a newfound source of happiness as they are finally able to appreciate the absence of the barking. In conclusion, the narrator is likely happy to be around quiet because it brings relief from the constant noise of the barking dog, offers a more peaceful and focused environment, represents a shift in the neighborhood dynamics, caters to their personal preferences and personality traits, and may even be a newfound source of pleasure after adapting to the noise.

I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn’t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead). One night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account. I don’t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he’d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me. I was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms. Whoever called saved me, but in a way I saved my own life that day. What I thought was just another routine post about stress got me the help I so desperately needed. I know without it, I would have ended my own life that day. Funny how that works. After receiving the text about his girlfriend he probably felt: - Stressed - Dizzy - not enough information - Frightened A:","output":"I'm truly sorry to hear about the struggles you've been facing and I commend your incredible resilience through the ordeals you've encountered. It's important to acknowledge how you have managed to move forward despite the challenges you faced. It's also a great testament to the power of speaking up and seeking help when needed, even if it was through a non-traditional route like social media. Receiving the text about your girlfriend while dealing with other stressors surely invoked a range of emotions and physical sensations, already heightened by your depressive state. For example: 1. Stressed: Your body and mind could have been overwhelmed by the influx of negative emotions and challenges, making it difficult to focus on anything else. You may have experienced heightened anxiety and found that your usual coping mechanisms were not sufficient to manage your stress levels. 2. Dizzy: The anxiety and stress could have caused physical reactions, such as dizziness, as your body tried to cope. This sensation may have added to your emotional distress, making the situation feel even more precarious. 3. Lacking information: The text messages you received might not have provided all the details you needed to understand the situation completely, leading to heightened anxiety and fear about the unknown. 4. Frightened: Fear could have compounded your feelings of stress and helplessness, making it even harder to process the text messages and events around you. The anxiety and stress might have been fueling further intrusive thoughts and exacerbating your depressive symptoms. Reaching out on social media was a key turning point for you, as it allowed someone to recognize the severity of your situation and act accordingly. They helped ensure that you received appropriate intervention, which ultimately led to better mental health support, including improved medication and therapeutic approaches. The experience demonstrates the importance of opening up and discussing mental health struggles. It's crucial not only for personal growth but also for helping others recognize when someone they care about may need support. In addition, it highlights the value of vigilance among friends and family members. By being aware of changes in the behavior and emotions of those close to us, we can identify potential warning signs and offer assistance before a crisis escalates. It's great to see that you are utilizing other platforms, like Quora, to find an alternative coping mechanism that aligns with your needs. Continuing to seek healthier ways to manage stress and overwhelming emotions can be vital in maintaining your well-being and preventing future relapses. Your experience is a poignant reminder that sometimes, seemingly small actions or seeming coincidences can have an enormous impact on our lives. No matter the channel, reaching out for help can play a crucial role in overcoming mental health challenges and saving lives."},{"instruction":"Options are: * not enough information. * It was viewed as a satire.. * It was viewed as offensive.. * It was a success.. Given those answer options, answer the question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts.

While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting the rope Herod's men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \\"The Kid\\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything.

The hat trick of primaries in Wisconsin, Maryland and Washington, D.C., capped yet another no-drama evening in Mitt Romney’s march toward the GOP presidential nomination. Romney is now more than halfway toward the delegates he needs to win his party’s nod, and Rick Santorum lost his last shot at a big, momentum-changing Midwestern win. Text Size - + reset Romney takes three primaries Santorum speaks after loses Below are POLITICO’s five takeaways on the night. 1) The curtain is closing Santorum is vowing to fight on, with a defiant election night speech delivered in his home state of Pennsylvania, miles away from where the votes were cast, replete with Etch-a-Sketch references and other less than genial comments about Romney. He said the race is at “halftime,” even though most political watchers and Republican leaders think it’s in the fourth quarter. He has a path to deny Romney 1,144 delegates — the number needed to win the GOP nod — if he stays in the game through May and June. And the primary may indeed last another month or two. But right now, there is now even less of a path to 1,144 for Santorum. Romney was not poised for a blowout in Wisconsin, and Santorum can take some comfort from the margin there, having once again outperformed the final polls before the vote and the exit surveys. That speaks again to the fact that there is anti-Romney sentiment in the GOP, but the field has been too weak to take advantage of it. (Also on POLITICO: PHOTOS: 50 craziest quotes of the 2012 race) Romney was on track to amass at least 75 of the 98 delegates available on Tuesday night. There is no real role for Santorum other than spoiler as exit polls showed him doing well among voters who had backed him before — the “very conservative” and evangelicals, who made up a smaller portion of the Maryland and Wisconsin electorate than in Southern states. There is no real role for Santorum other than spoiler as exit polls showed Romney doing well among voters who had eluded him before — that is, the “very conservative” and evangelicals who made up a smaller portion of the Maryland and Wisconsin electorate than they did in Southern states. Nonetheless, Romney made gains, and the narrative about him struggling with conservatives will continue, but it will become tougher to sell, even as concerns about the front-runner remain within the base. Santorum now is going to find it harder to get media oxygen and donor support. “Since his wins in Alabama and Mississippi, Santorum has, essentially, had the two-man race he wanted, and he’s only won in one state, Louisiana,” said conservative strategist Keith Appell. “He can stay in as long as the money keeps coming in, but the delegate clock is ticking. No one can, or should, tell a candidate to get out of the race, and Santorum is also looking to the future.” Appell added a note of caution regarding Santorum’s future, a theme that many have sounded in recent weeks. “The Republican Party primary voters tend to be drawn to the so-called next person in line, and he could be that person if Romney wins the nomination but loses to Obama in the fall. If that’s part of his calculation, then he also has to consider how he conducts himself if he continues to lose and Romney looks more and more inevitable.” It’s understandable that Santorum would want a chance to run in his home state later this month. But last night’s votes are likely to dent his poll numbers there. And the party has already started running out of patience. ||||| Story highlights Evangelicals, tea partiers and others from Santorum's coalition voted for Romney Santorum's campaign now pins its hopes on Pennsylvania and Texas Big endorsements finally paid off for Romney campaign Republican presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney had a big night Tuesday, sweeping primaries in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Wisconsin and putting more distance between himself and closest pursuer Rick Santorum in the race for delegates. Here are five things we learned from Tuesday's vote: Santorum's coalition fell apart Wisconsin Republicans didn't just side with Mitt Romney on Tuesday -- they rejected Rick Santorum. Make no mistake: Santorum campaigned hard in Wisconsin, raising the stakes for the primary. JUST WATCHED Santorum looking ahead to PA primary Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Santorum looking ahead to PA primary 02:16 JUST WATCHED Obama looking ahead to Romney face-off? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama looking ahead to Romney face-off? 03:29 He ignored Maryland, the night's other big prize, and hit the Wisconsin bowling alley-and-cheese curd circuit, telling voters how a win there would shake up the GOP race. \\"Wisconsin will send a sound around this country, like the sound of Lexington and Concord,\\" Santorum said at a rally in Beaver Dam. \\"You will be the shot heard 'round the world.\\" That shot was never fired, because the Santorum coalition actually voted for Romney. Big sweep for Romney Evangelicals, tea party supporters, those supporting \\"traditional values\\" and people calling themselves \\"very conservative\\" went Romney's way, exit polls showed. And one of Santorum's key messages -- that Romney can't stand up to Barack Obama because of his support for a health insurance mandate in Massachusetts -- also fell flat. On the exit poll question of \\"Who do you trust to handle health care?\\" it was Romney who came out on top. But Santorum will fight on Over the last 10 days, the media and the Republican establishment seemed to come to a consensus -- cheered on by the Romney campaign -- that a Santorum loss in Wisconsin would spell doom for his campaign. That may be true given Romney's wide delegate lead and his snowballing momentum, but Santorum showed no signs of quitting Tuesday, promising to forge ahead through May, when a slew of conservative Southern states will cast votes. Santorum: \\"It's halftime\\" He delivered his concession speech in the tiny town of Mars, Pennsylvania, boasting of his intimate connection with the state he represented in Congress for 16 years. In an interview on CNN, Santorum's chief strategist John Brabender claimed that wins in Pennsylvania on April 24 and Texas on May 29 would propel his boss to the nomination over Romney -- a dubious claim considering that victories in both states would do little to cut into Romney's delegate advantage. But even if a Pennsylvania win would somehow help secure the nomination for Santorum, the opposite is also true: A loss in his home state would cripple his campaign. It's possible that might happen, and the Romney campaign knows it, which is precisely why the frontrunner will ride his latest burst of momentum into Pennsylvania on Wednesday for two days of campaigning on Santorum's turf. Big-name endorsements finally had an impact We've written in this space before that endorsements have been the fool's gold of this election cycle: attention-grabbing and sought after, but ultimately not worth very much. This was not true in Wisconsin, Tuesday's marquee battleground. Romney was practically swimming in big-name endorsements in the run-up to the vote, thanks to a GOP establishment increasingly eager to end the Republican-on-Republican mayhem and pivot to the fall election against President Barack Obama. Top conservatives like Marco Rubio, Mike Lee and Wisconsin's own Paul Ryan jumped on the Romney train last week, as did former President George H.W. Bush. And leading Republicans as ideologically distant as Mitch McConnell and Jim DeMint expressed their desire to see the Republican primary fight wrap up, implicitly siding with Romney. Wisconsin was paying attention. More than 60% of Republicans said the Romney endorsements were a factor in their votes, and 33% called them an \\"important\\" factor. Most of those voters, of course, broke heavily toward Romney. The message these new surrogates were pushing -- that Romney is the likely nominee even if he doesn't have the delegates yet -- appeared to resonate. A huge majority of Wisconsin Republicans, 83%, said Romney is \\"most likely\\" to win the GOP nomination. Embattled governor has a posse Exit polling out of Wisconsin revealed some bad news for Democrats and their organized labor allies: Republicans adore Scott Walker, their embattled governor who faces a recall election in June. Walker's job is on the line thanks to his controversial push last year to roll back collective bargaining rights for state workers. But the Republican base has his back. According to exit polls, 82% of those who voted in Tuesday's primary approve of Walker as governor, and 71% \\"strongly\\" approve. That emphatic support will be crucial for Walker as he faces off against his probable Democratic opponent, former Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett, in a race likely to be decided by a tiny slice of undecided voters. A poll from NBC News and Marist released last week showed that Wisconsin registered voters are evenly divided on Walker, with 48% percent approving of his job performance and 48% disapproving. Only 6% of Wisconsinites in the poll said they were undecided about which candidate to get behind. The formula for Walker, then, is pretty straightforward: sway most of the undecided voters, and get those who \\"strongly\\" approve of his record to the polls on June 5. Barack Obama will be the Democratic nominee OK, we already knew that. But according to CNN's delegate estimate, the president collected enough delegates in Maryland and the District of Columbia on Tuesday night to formally secure the Democratic nomination. Now we know for certain that Obama will accept his party's nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. The news officially puts to rest the silly chatter about a Democratic primary challenger (Howard Dean! Russ Feingold!) that bubbled up in 2010 during the most dismal moments of Obama's presidency. |||||Summary:","output":"Mitt Romney's march toward the GOP presidential nomination continued after winning primaries in Wisconsin, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., putting him more than halfway toward the delegates he needs to win his party’s nod.

In her eyes, the hotel embodied sophistication, elegance, and a level of service that would make her special day truly unforgettable. One of the primary reasons the girl chose the hotel over the motel was the superior cleanliness and attention to detail. Hotels often devote significant resources to ensuring that their rooms and facilities are hygienic and well-maintained, thus creating a pristine environment for guests to enjoy. This level of cleanliness conveys a sense of comfort and an elevated standard of living, which could enhance the overall atmosphere of her wedding night. Additionally, hotels usually provide a wider range of amenities than motels, such as on-site restaurants, room service, fitness centers, and swimming pools. These amenities not only contribute to a more enjoyable stay, but they also offer the newlyweds an array of options for relaxation and entertainment. Celebrating their wedding night at a hotel with these additional features would allow them to indulge in a romantic dinner, take a refreshing swim, or simply unwind in their luxurious suite after a tiring yet momentous day. Moreover, hotels often hold a sense of prestige and grandeur that motels typically lack. This distinction can be attributed to the architectural design, landscaped surroundings, and thoughtful details, such as high-quality linens and toiletries. By choosing a hotel, the girl wanted to ensure that she and her partner were surrounded by the splendor and glamour they deserved on their wedding night. Lastly, the level of customer service in hotels tends to surpass that in motels. Hotel staff are often dedicated to anticipating and accommodating the needs of their guests, making every effort to create a personalized and exceptional experience.

The question is asking about the number of games Brett Favre started in a row, which refers to his consecutive starts streak. A more detailed and reasonable answer would be: Brett Favre holds the record for the most consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback. He started in 297 regular season games in a row, a streak that began in 1992 when he was with the Green Bay Packers and lasted until 2010 during his time with the Minnesota Vikings. If you include the playoff games, the number of consecutive starts increases to 321 games. This remarkable streak demonstrates Favre's durability and resilience throughout his 20-year career, having played for the Atlanta Falcons (1991), Green Bay Packers (1992–2007), New York Jets (2008), and Minnesota Vikings (2009–2010)."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Millions of people in the world jog for exercise. For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body. Two teams of runners took part in a study about exercise. Red team ran 10 km in the heat, while Green team ran the same distance in the morning in cool weather. The Red team experienced more runners with health problems. Which team had more runners with muscle weakness? The answer is:","output":"The Red team had more runners with muscle weakness. The question provides information about how jogging in the heat can lead to problems such as electrolyte loss and the potential for life-threatening conditions. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatigue, and dizziness, and if not treated properly, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate, which could lead to a heart attack. Since sports drinks can help restore electrolytes quickly, it is important for individuals who exercise in hotter conditions to stay hydrated and replenish their electrolyte levels. In the given study, two teams of runners completed a 10 km run. The Red team ran their distance in the heat, while the Green team ran the same distance in cool weather during the morning. Since the Red team ran in the heat, they were exposed to conditions that increased the likelihood of electrolyte loss due to excessive sweating. This potential for electrolyte deficiency subsequently put the Red team's runners at a higher risk of experiencing muscle weakness compared to the Green team, who ran in cooler temperatures. As a result, it can be concluded that the Red team, who ran in the heat, experienced more runners with muscle weakness because they were at an increased risk of developing electrolyte deficiencies during their run. In contrast, the Green team, who ran in cooler weather, faced a lower risk of electrolyte loss and the subsequent health problems associated with it. It is essential for runners and athletes to be aware of the dangers posed by exercising in hot conditions and to take adequate measures for staying hydrated and replenishing electrolyte levels to avoid the onset of potentially dangerous health issues."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence. Interim chief executive Bill Barron said the unnamed officials believed they had been unfairly treated in a controversy embroiling the commission. This year has seen the body involved in a public row with groups of crofters. Its board has made a public apology for its handling of this row and sought the resignation of its convener, who says he has done nothing wrong. Wednesday's meeting in Inverness was the first to be held since a private gathering of board members and convener Colin Kennedy last week, and September's formal meeting of the board in Brora when Mr Kennedy was asked to stand down by the board after he had walked out. Mr Kennedy has argued that the board's vote on asking him to resign was not valid. In October, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scottish government ministers had the power to intervene in the affairs of the troubled Crofting Commission. Ms Sturgeon said ministers would not ordinarily get involved in the internal operations of the commission. However, during a First Minister's Questions session in Holyrood, she said legislation did give ministers the power to intervene if required.","output":"Part #1: Understanding the article. Usage: This is about comprehending the article before attempting to summarize it. From the given text, we understand several elements: controversies involving the Crofting Commission, the tension between the commission and crofters, the issue with Bill Barron and Colin Kennedy, and potential government intervention by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Understanding the core elements is crucial in condensing the information into one sentence. Part #2: Identifying key points. Usage: This involves focusing on the most important points discussed in the article. For example, the officials believing they were unfairly treated, the tensions with crofters, the board's accused mishandling, the controversy with Colin Kennedy and the possible intervention by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon are all key aspects of the article. Recognizing these parts helps to ensure that the main themes are represented in the summary sentence. Part #3: Consolidating key points into one sentence. Usage: This step involves crafting a single sentence that encapsulates the main points of the article. For instance, \\"Despite accusations of unfair treatment, an ongoing public spat with crofters, and a board member controversy, the Crofting Commission faces possible intervention from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.\\" This sentence has covered the main points of the article into a single, cohesive sentence. Part #4: Reviewing and revising the summarizing sentence. Usage: This step involves revising the sentence to ensure it accurately reflects the main ideas of the article without being overly complicated. If we realize that some crucial detail is missing or that the sentence context can be unclear, revisions should be made. In this case, the given sentence seems to encapsulate the crux of the article while being concise and clear, hence no revisions are necessary."},{"instruction":"Q:Title: Author has a very NEGATIVE ATTITUDE.

Today computers are getting smaller and smaller. But they work faster and faster. What can computers do? A writer has said, \\"people can't live without computers today.\\" The Internet came a little later than computers. It is about twenty-five years later than computers.

While the concept of the Internet can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s, it is essential to understand its history to appreciate its contributions and implications on contemporary society. After the launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, by the Soviet Union in 1957, the United States established the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which focused on various scientific and technological research initiatives, including computer networking. This led to the development of the ARPANET in the late 1960s, a precursor to the modern Internet. The ARPANET's first successful connection between two computers occurred on October 29, 1969, marking the birth of the Internet. In the 1970s, researchers developed the foundational protocols for data transmission, such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). The invention of email in 1971 by Ray Tomlinson and the introduction of Ethernet by Robert Metcalfe in 1973 revolutionized digital communications. During the 1980s, computer networking continued to grow and spread across universities and institutions. The invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 paved the way for the establishment of modern websites and web browsers. By the 1990s, the Internet became accessible and popular with the general public, thanks to web browsers like Mosaic and Netscape Navigator. The dot-com boom of the 1990s led to the founding of iconic companies such as Google, Amazon, and eBay.

Keith needed to find the pros and cons of both crops. Would crop A more likely or less likely be virus resistant than crop B? Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... A:","output":"Crop A, being a GMO crop, would be more likely to be virus resistant than crop B, a non-GMO crop.

Councillor Rob Stewart believed they \\"could not be in a better position\\" to agree the deal which could be worth millions over the next 15 years. But a transatlantic cable, described as a \\"game changer\\" in bringing ultrafast broadband to the Swansea Bay region, is not part of the deal. It would be separate but complementary, said Mr Stewart. Swansea Bay City Region's chairman Sir Terry Matthews, interviewed a year ago, had described the importance of the communication channel from New York to London via the south west Wales region. He added at the time that the cable would make the Swansea Bay City Deal, unlike those put forward by other areas, deliver for the whole of the UK rather than the region alone. But Mr Stewart said the Project Jupiter cable was a separate project - and like Tidal Lagoon's relationship with the city deal's energy projects - would be \\"aligned\\" and \\"complementary\\" rather than directly part of the city deal. BBC Wales has seen a copy of the latest plan put to the UK government. What is on the table involves 11 different projects ranging from investments of £50m in the Swansea City and Waterfront Digital District and £5m for the Yr Egin creative hub project. Mr Stewart denied that the focus on buildings could lead to a return of the failed Technium project. He added that the Swansea Techniums had been a success story. The city deal aims to support \\"next generation industries\\" and to apply internet technologies for the region's energy sector. It also aims for the four council areas stretching from Neath Port Talbot to Pembrokeshire to become a magnet for hi-tech and cloud data firms. Life science firms would work alongside local hospitals, including an eye-catching £225m \\"wellness village\\" planned for near Llanelli. But Mr Stewart strongly denied the focus had shifted away from the \\"internet coast\\" vision to a more traditional focus of bricks and mortar developments. \\"In order to deliver the sorts of economic change we want in this region we have to take forward the fifth generation technologies - the establishment of the test bed,\\" he said. \\"We've been very clear about that and Sir Terry Matthews and his business partner from Wesley Clover, Simon Gibson, have been integral in bringing that together. \\"They can demonstrate though the model they've successfully rolled out in Canada, they've created 22,000 jobs there and we believe we can make that sort of economic impact here. \\"Whilst there are several projects which will have construction as part of it, the real golden thread through the deal are still those new technologies and new industries.\\" City deals exist to give financial support for councils to work more regionally on big projects - which will stimulate private investment and have a real transformational impact. There are hopes the Swansea Bay deal could be mentioned in Wednesday's Budget from Chancellor Philip Hammond. Mr Stewart said very positive meetings had been held with the Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns and Swansea-born Lord Heseltine, adviser to the communities and local government secretary. \\"As far as we're concerned we've answered all the questions posed to us by Treasury officials and others and feel we're at the point when we're ready to sign,\\" Mr Stewart told BBC Wales. He said £673m of private investment was ready to come into the region and the bid had \\"substantial support\\" from a wide range from within the private sector. \\"It's still a unique deal and still a very class-leading deal in terms of what it tries to do,\\" said Mr Stewart. \\"Some of the comments back from the secretary of state and others is that it's a very innovative deal, it does lots of things individually that others are doing but nobody is doing those in the way we are putting this together. \\"The biggest vote of confidence is if you look at the UK's industrial strategy, recently released by Theresa May, you map that against what our city deal is doing and the two are indivisible.

This indicates an increased rate of digestion. 2. Faster digestion might mean that the enzymes and acids in the stomach and small intestine have less time to break down the food completely. 3. When food isn't broken down into its smallest molecules effectively, it becomes more difficult for the nutrients to pass through the wall of the small intestine and be absorbed into the bloodstream. 4.

Genes are essential components of an organism's DNA, responsible for heredity and the overall development of an organism. They carry the genetic information necessary for cells to survive, replicate, and perform their specific functions in the living organism. In this context, it is important to explore the various roles genes play in heredity, gene expression, regulation, and the overall development of organisms. 1. Heredity: Genes are the fundamental units of heredity, and they carry the genetic information from one generation to the next through a process known as inheritance. In reproduction, parent organisms pass down their genes to their offspring, either sexually or asexually. During sexual reproduction, offspring inherit half of their genetic information from each parent, resulting in unique combinations of genes that contribute to the genetic diversity of a population. Asexual reproduction, on the other hand, produces genetically identical offspring. 2. Gene Expression: Genes encode instructions for synthesizing proteins, which are essential to cellular function. Gene expression refers to the process by which the genetic information stored in DNA is translated into proteins by molecular machines in cells. This process consists of two main stages: transcription and translation. During transcription, a segment of DNA is copied into RNA, and in translation, the RNA is decoded by ribosomes into a corresponding sequence of amino acids to form a protein. The proteins then execute various functions in cells, including cell signaling, structural support, and catalyzing chemical reactions. 3. Gene Regulation: The expression of genes can vary depending on the specific needs of the cell, its environment, and its stage of development. Regulating gene expression entails managing when, where, and how much of a specific protein is produced. This process occurs at multiple levels, such as the rate of transcription, RNA processing, translation, and protein degradation. Gene regulation is crucial to ensure cellular function, proper development, and response to environmental changes. 4. Developmental Control: Genes play a key role in determining the overall development and differentiation of organisms. As multicellular organisms develop from a single fertilized cell, zygote, into complex structures with specialized tissues and organs, genes orchestrate how cells divide, change, and differentiate to create distinct cell types. This process is regulated by various genes, including those that encode transcription factors and signaling molecules, which act together to ensure proper spatiotemporal coordination of cellular functions. 5. Mutation and Evolution: Over time, variations and changes, also known as mutations, can occur in genes due to errors in DNA replication, exposure to mutagenic agents, or other factors. Although many mutations are neutral or harmful, some can lead to advantageous changes that provide survival benefits to an organism within its environment. These variations contribute to the overall genetic diversity and evolution of populations and species over time. In conclusion, genes play pivotal roles in heredity, gene expression, regulation, overall development, and evolution of organisms. Understanding the complex interactions, regulation, and functions of genes not only helps us understand the fundamental principles of life but also has important implications in medical, agricultural, and biotechnological applications."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In the opening shot, an alien spaceship flies through space and enters Earth's atmosphere near Antarctica.

Here are possible answers to this question: - headache - get up - happiness - discomfort - shock I believe the correct choice is \\"shock\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"Awaking from a nightmare can be a jarring and unsettling experience that can leave one feeling a wide range of emotions and sensations. Among the possible options provided, \\"shock\\" seems to be the most appropriate choice due to the sudden and intense nature of nightmares. However, it is important to address each potential answer and explain their connection or lack thereof to the experience of waking up from a nightmare. 1. Headache: While it is possible for some individuals to experience a headache after waking up from a nightmare, this is not a universal reaction. A headache might occur due to the increased stress and anxiety experienced during the nightmare, leading to muscle tension in the neck or head. Additionally, the abrupt change in the sleep cycle, such as waking up suddenly, could also result in a headache. However, this response varies from one person to another and should not be considered a definitive answer. 2. Get up: Waking up from a nightmare might trigger a strong urge to get up, either to shake off the distressing dream or to make sure that one is safe in their surroundings. This reaction might be influenced by the severity of the nightmare and the individual's coping mechanism. However, not everyone jumps out of bed after a nightmare, with some opting to stay put and calm themselves down. Therefore, although \\"get up\\" is a plausible reaction, it is not a definitive answer. 3. Happiness: The feeling of happiness after waking up from a nightmare might result from the relief that the dream was not real and the realization that one is safe. However, the initial emotions experienced upon waking up are likely to be more negative, such as fear, anxiety, or sadness. Consequently, happiness might not be an immediate response or the primary emotion experienced, making it a less appropriate option. 4. Discomfort: Waking up from a nightmare might leave a lingering sense of discomfort, especially if the dream was particularly disturbing or unsettling. This emotional and psychological distress could manifest as physical discomfort, resulting from increased stress levels and muscle tension. However, the term 'discomfort' might not fully capture the intensity of the emotions experienced after a nightmare and lacks the suddenness associated with the term 'shock.' 5. Shock: The correct choice identified is \\"shock,\\" as it best encapsulates the abrupt and powerful emotions experienced upon awakening from a nightmare. The vivid, distressing events that transpire during a nightmare can leave an individual feeling disoriented and unsettled. As the brain transitions from the dream state to awake consciousness, one may struggle to make sense of the intense emotions stirred up by the nightmare. This sudden disorientation and realization that they are safe can lead to a sense of shock. In conclusion, while various emotions and reactions might surface after waking up from a nightmare, \\"shock\\" appears to be the most appropriate choice. The intensity and abruptness associated with shock better convey the experience of transitioning from a distressing dream to the awake state. However, it is vital to acknowledge that individual responses might vary, and the other options might still be relevant to specific scenarios."},{"instruction":"Process: - The salt water is heated - As the saltwater is heated the water becomes a gas - The salt particles sink to the bottom of the container - Gaseous water is piped into another container - Allowed to cool - The salt particles are left behind in the first container - The second container contains fresh water. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the open container takes longer to heat happens, how will it affect less water becomes a gas. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If the open container takes longer to heat, it could have an indirect effect on the process. This means that the energy required to convert the liquid water into gaseous water (water vapor) will take longer to reach, resulting in a slower evaporation process. Consequently, less water becomes a gas over the same period of time compared to an optimal heating scenario. However, this perturbation does not necessarily affect the overall process once it is complete, as eventually the saltwater will still be heated, and the water will become gas, leaving the salt particles behind. The process will just take longer. Once the gaseous water is piped into the second container and allowed to cool, the second container will still contain fresh water, while the salt particles are left behind in the first container."},{"instruction":"Leo: Premise: \\"A couple stands in the street with their backs to a large mirror.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A young couple poses in front of a mirror.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Let's examine each part of the sentence more closely: 1. \\"Der Himmel ist blau\\" - \\"The sky is blue.\\" The subject, \\"Himmel\\" (sky), is masculine in German and takes the definite article \\"der\\". \\"Ist\\" is the third person singular form of the verb \\"sein\\" (to be) and \\"blau\\" is the adjective describing the sky's color. 2. \\"Die Sonne scheint\\" - \\"The sun is shining.\\" \\"Sonne\\" (sun) is feminine in German and is accompanied by the definite article \\"die.\\" The verb \\"scheint\\" (shines) is the third person singular form of \\"scheinen\\" (to shine). 3. \\"Und die Vögel singen fröhlich\\" - \\"And the birds are singing happily.\\" In this part of the sentence, \\"und\\" is a coordinating conjunction connecting two independent clauses. \\"Vögel\\" (birds) is a plural noun with the definite article \\"die.\\" The verb \\"singen\\" (sing) is in its infinitive form, followed by the adverb \\"fröhlich\\" (happily) describing the manner in which the birds are singing. 4. \\"Am Morgen\\" - \\"In the morning.\\" The preposition \\"am\\" is a contraction of \\"an\\" (on) and the definite article \\"dem\\" (the). In German, \\"Morgen\\" (morning) is masculine and takes the dative case after the preposition \\"an,\\" necessitating the contraction."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence that about [Baldwinsville HS TOTAL_MEDALS 2].","output":"In simple words, Baldwinsville High School received a total of 2 medals.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What drove the sea beast from its natural habitat? Movie plot title: It Came from Beneath the Sea Movie plot: A nuclear submarine on maneuvers in the Pacific Ocean, captained by Commander Pete Mathews (Kenneth Tobey), comes into contact with a massive sonar return. The boat is disabled but manages to free itself and return to Pearl Harbor. Tissue from a huge sea creature is discovered jammed in the submarine's dive planes. A man-and-woman team of marine biologists, Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue) and John Carter (Donald Curtis), is called in; they identify the tissue as being a small part of a gigantic octopus. The military authorities scoff, but are finally persuaded after receiving reports of missing swimmers and ships at sea being pulled under by a large animal. Both scientists conclude the sea beast is from the Mindanao Deep, having been forced from its natural habitat by hydrogen bomb testing in the area, which has made the giant creature radioactive, driving off its natural food supply.[3] The scientists suggest the disappearances of a Japanese fishing fleet and a Siberian seal boat may be the work of the foraging sea beast. Both Pete and the Navy representatives express doubt and demand further proof. Later, as Pete assists John and Lesley, a report comes in of an attack on a French shipping boat; several men escaped in a raft. The French survivors are questioned by psychiatrists, and when the first sailor's description of a creature with giant tentacles is met with skepticism, the other sailors refuse to testify. Lesley is able to convince the first sailor to repeat his story for government officials, who then have the evidence they need. The U.S. government halts all sea traffic in the North Pacific without revealing the reason. John flies out to sea to trace a missing ship, while Pete and Lesley follow up on a report of three missing people on the coast of Oregon. The local sheriff, Bill Nash (Harry Lauter), takes Pete and Leslie to the site of the attack, where they find a giant suction cup imprint in the beach sand; they then request that John join them. Bill is later attacked along the beach by the giant...

How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of making Peach Liqueur sauce at home, I'll provide you with a step-by-step guide. This will ensure that you are able to recreate the sauce by using the correct ingredients and methods. Step 1: Gather ingredients To make Peach Liqueur sauce, you'll need the following ingredients: - 2 cups fresh or canned peach slices (drained if canned) - 1/2 cup granulated sugar - 1/4 cup water - 1 tablespoon cornstarch - 1/4 cup peach liqueur (such as Peach Schnapps) - Zest of 1 lemon - 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Step 2: Prepare peaches If using fresh peaches, wash, pit, and slice the peaches. If using canned peaches, drain the peaches but reserve the peach juice for potential use later on. Step 3: Combine sugar and cornstarch In a small bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar and cornstarch. This mixture will be used as a thickening agent for the sauce. Step 4: Make peach puree In a blender or food processor, add the peach slices and blend until you have a smooth puree consistency. Set aside. Step 5: Cook the sauce In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the peach puree, sugar and cornstarch mixture, and water. Stir constantly until the sauce begins to thicken, which should take about 5 to 7 minutes. Step 6: Add peach liqueur, lemon zest, and lemon juice Once the sauce has thickened, remove it from heat. Stir in the peach liqueur, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Taste the sauce, and if needed, adjust the sweetness by adding more sugar or the reserved peach juice (if using canned peaches). Step 7: Cool and serve Allow the Peach Liqueur sauce to cool slightly before using it on desserts, such as ice cream, cake, or fruit. You can also store the sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for later use. By following these steps, you can successfully create a delicious Peach Liqueur sauce at home that adds a flavorful touch to your favorite desserts."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"There is nothing special about the next steps to be undertaken by the government of Kosovo.\\" to Turkish?","output":"\\"Kosova hükümeti tarafından atılacak olan önümüzdeki adımlarla ilgili özel bir şey yok.\\" demek ister.

Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Context: Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom. Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning., The Corps of Royal Engineers, usually just called the Royal Engineers (RE), and commonly known as the \\"Sappers\\", is one of the corps of the British Army. It is highly regarded throughout the military, and especially the Army., The Battle of Rorke's Drift, also known as the Defence of Rorke's Drift, was a battle in the Anglo-Zulu War. The defence of the mission station of Rorke's Drift, under the command of Lieutenant John Chard of the Royal Engineers and Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, immediately followed the British Army's defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879, and continued into the following day, 23 January., Major Gonville Bromhead VC (29 August 1845 9 February 1891) was a British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of the British armed forces. He received the medal for his part in the defence of Rorke's Drift in January 1879 where a small British garrison of 139 soldiers successfully repulsed an assault by some 4,000 Zulu warriors. Bromhead was portrayed by Michael Caine in the film \\"Zulu\\", which depicted the battle., Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819 22 January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death. From 1 May 1876, she adopted the additional title of Empress of India., The Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest award of the United Kingdom honours system. It is awarded for gallantry \\"in the face of the enemy\\" to members of the British armed forces. It may be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879. Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857, two thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace., William Wilson Allen , VC ( circa 1843 -- 12 March 1890 ) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross ( VC ) for his actions at the Battle of Rorke 's Drift in January 1879 , the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces ., The Battle of Isandlwana (alternative spelling: Isandhlwana) on 22 January 1879 was the first major encounter in the AngloZulu War between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom. Eleven days after the British commenced their invasion of Zululand in South Africa, a Zulu force of some 20,000 warriors attacked a portion of the British main column consisting of about 1,800 British, colonial and native troops and perhaps 400 civilians. The Zulus were equipped mainly with the traditional assegai iron spears and cow-hide shields, but also had a number of muskets and old rifles though they were not formally trained in their use. The British and colonial troops were armed with the state-of-the-art Martini-Henry breech-loading rifle and two 7-pounder (3-inch, 76 mm) mountain guns deployed as field guns, as well as a rocket battery. Despite a vast disadvantage in weapons technology, the numerically superior Zulus ultimately overwhelmed the poorly led and badly deployed British, killing over 1,300 troops, including all those out on the forward firing line. The Zulu army suffered around a thousand killed., The Anglo-Zulu War was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom. Following Lord Carnarvon's successful introduction of federation in Canada, it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa. In 1874, Sir Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner for the British Empire to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the South African Republic and the Kingdom of Zululand and its army., The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom. The force was initially administered by the War Office from London, which in 1964 was subsumed into the Ministry of Defence. The professional head of the British Army is the Chief of the General Staff., Subject: william allen , Relation: country_of_citizenship, Options: (A) british (B) british empire (C) great britain (D) india (E) kingdom of great britain (F) london (G) united kingdom (H) united kingdom of great britain and ireland A:","output":"The task is to find the country of citizenship for William Allen based on the given context that discusses the relation between Buckingham Palace, the Royal Engineers, the Battle of Rorke's Drift, Major Gonville Bromhead, Queen Victoria, the Victoria Cross, William Allen, and the Anglo-Zulu War.

(B) British Empire: Refers to the larger entity encompassing several nations, not a country itself. (C) Great Britain: Refers to the geographic region, not the specific name of a country. (D) India: Not relevant to his citizenship. (E) Kingdom of Great Britain: The historical name of the country, but not applicable for the time he lived. (F) London: A city, not a country. (G) United Kingdom: A potential answer since it is the name of a country.

Animals' ability to act reasonably is believed to come partly from what we may call \\"genetic learning\\" , which is different from the individual learning that an animal does in the course of its own lifetime . Genetic learning is learning by a species --animals of the same kind--as a whole , and it is achieved by selection of those members of each generation that happen to act in the right way .

From the moment you walk in, you are transported into a world of beautiful plants, delightful fairy lights, and an atmosphere that is both magical and serene. The ambiance truly sets the tone for an unforgettable meal that tantalizes the senses. The staff at The Enchanted Garden are courteous, attentive, and knowledgeable. Our waiter greeted us with a warm and friendly smile, giving us a thorough run-down of the innovative menu that boasts an impressive array of dishes inspired by cuisines from around the world. His recommendations were spot-on, and we felt confident in our choices, knowing they were backed by expert advice. We started our meal with a generous serving of truffle-infused mushroom bruschetta and a plate of crispy, fresh, and flavorful Thai spring rolls. The bruschetta was a symphony of flavors: earthy mushrooms, creamy truffle, and tangy balsamic glaze melded beautifully with the crunch and warmth of the perfectly toasted bread. The spring rolls were light and accompanied by a lip-smackingly good dipping sauce that left us wanting for more. For our main courses, we decided on the pan-seared Chilean sea bass and the spinach and ricotta stuffed cannelloni. The sea bass was expertly cooked; its exterior was crisp while the interior remained succulent and flaky. The accompanying lemon-butter sauce elevated the dish to heavenly heights, and the bed of garlic smashed potatoes provided a comforting and flavorful base. The cannelloni, on the other hand, showcased the perfect balance of rich, smooth ricotta cheese and fresh, vibrant spinach, encased in tender pasta tubes and topped with a luscious tomato sauce. The dish was completed with a sprinkle of velvety mozzarella that left us in a state of euphoria. To conclude our gastronomic journey, we indulged in a decadent chocolate fondant cake with raspberry coulis and a refreshing mango sorbet. The fondant cake was a chocoholic's dream, its gooey, molten center spilling out at the touch of our forks while the tangy raspberry coulis cut through the richness with aplomb. The mango sorbet provided a much-needed palate cleanser, and was a celebration of natural sweetness - a beautiful finale to an outstanding meal. In addition to the exquisite food, the beverage selection at The Enchanted Garden is second to none. We opted for a bottle of their recommended red wine, which was masterfully paired with our dishes, enhancing the flavors without overpowering them. The bartender also whipped up delightful mocktails that were visually stunning and a treat to the taste buds. The Enchanted Garden is an exceptional dining experience worth trying for any special occasion, or when you wish to indulge in a world-class meal that will whisk you away to a dreamy, culinary wonderland. From the enchanting decor and the impeccable service to the unparalleled flavors and presentation of each dish, The Enchanted Garden deserves all the accolades and rave reviews it receives.

A:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"healing requires what as well as sitting\\" would be sleep. This is because healing, in a broad sense, requires rest and giving the body a chance to recover. Rest is not limited to sitting, but also includes other forms of physical and mental repose. Among the given answer choices, sleep is the most appropriate response for the following reasons: 1. Sleep is a crucial aspect of rest: Sleep is an essential component of physical and mental rest where the body has a chance to repair and regenerate itself. During sleep, our body enters a restorative phase where various physiological processes occur, such as tissue repair, the release of growth hormones, and the consolidation of memories. These processes allow the body to heal effectively and efficiently. 2. Sleep supports the immune system: An adequate amount of sleep is necessary for maintaining a healthy immune system. The immune system plays a vital role in the healing process by protecting the body against infections and facilitating the repair of damaged tissues. Studies have shown that sleep deprivation can negatively impact the immune system, making it harder for the body to heal. 3. The healing process is optimized during sleep: The body's healing mechanism operates more efficiently during sleep. As we sleep, our body undergoes various processes that support the healing of tissues, muscles, and organs. For example, during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stage, our body experiences an increase in blood flow to the muscles, allowing for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients that promote healing and growth. 4. Sleep reduces stress and inflammation: Stress and inflammation can hinder the body's healing process. Sleep helps regulate stress hormones, such as cortisol, and reduces inflammation by increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. By lowering stress and inflammation, sleep facilitates a conducive environment for the body to heal and recover. In conclusion, the best answer to the question \\"healing requires what as well as sitting\\" is sleep, as it encompasses various aspects of rest that promote the healing process. Sleep plays a vital role in supporting the immune system, optimizing the body's healing mechanisms, and reducing stress and inflammation, all of which contribute to faster and more effective healing."},{"instruction":"Keywords: chapter, information, text What is a sentence that includes all these keywords?","output":"In this chapter, the author presents valuable information by carefully analyzing the text and its various components."},{"instruction":"Fast Forward columnist Rob Pegoraro will be online to discuss recent reviews, including Portable Media Centers and Apple's iMac G5.

Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Settlement\\" correctly answer the question \\"Was the arrival of the Europeans a positive development for the Arawaks?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Settlement\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Was the arrival of the Europeans a positive development for the Arawaks?\\". Instead, the answer should be \\"No, it was not a positive development\\" because the paragraph states that the Arawak population was subjugated by the Spanish, many died due to oppression and diseases brought by the Europeans, and some even committed suicide to avoid living under the conditions imposed by the Spanish. Additionally, the arrival of the Europeans led to the decline of the Arawak population and the introduction of African slaves to work the land."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to count the number of words in a sentence that contain the given letter Problem:Sentence: 'cows are eating grass in the woods at twilight'.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Who recommends using serum?

Such Web-based applications eventually came to be known as \\"Rich Internet Applications\\" . In 2004, Macromedia Flex was released, and specifically targeted the application development market. Flex introduced new user interface components, advanced data visualization components, data remoting, and a modern IDE . Flex competed with Asynchronous JavaScript and XML and Microsoft Silverlight during its tenure. Flex was upgraded to support integration with remote data sources, using AMF, BlazeDS, Adobe LiveCycle, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and others. As of 2015, Flex applications can be published for desktop platforms using Adobe AIR. Between 2006 and 2016, the Speedtest.net web service conducted over 9.0 billion speed tests using an RIA built with Adobe Flash. In 2016, the service shifted to HTML5 due to the decreasing availability of Adobe Flash Player on PCs. As of 2016, Web applications and RIAs can be developed with Flash using the ActionScript 3.0 programming language and related tools such as Adobe Flash Builder. Third-party IDEs such as FlashDevelop and Powerflasher FDT also enable developers to create Flash games and applications, and are generally similar to Microsoft Visual Studio. Flex applications are typically built using Flex frameworks such as PureMVC. Based on the above article, answer a question.

(CNN) -- In dueling speeches that sought to frame the economic debate for their election showdown in November, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on Thursday offered differing visions for how to restore strong growth while telling separate Ohio crowds that the other's policies have failed. The president and the former Massachusetts governor both emphasized particular themes of community in their campaign speeches in a battleground state hit hard by the 2008 recession and its aftermath. Romney, speaking at a factory in the Cincinnati area minutes before Obama's speech in Cleveland, focused on what he called the president's failure to deliver promised economic growth so far in his first term. White voters were split on","output":"which candidate's economic vision would be the best solution to the nation's financial woes. Throughout the rest of the passage, it becomes evident that both Obama and Romney presented compelling perspectives, leaving the ultimate decision to the voting populace. Obama's approach to restoring economic growth concentrated on increasing government investment in essential infrastructure, education, and clean energy. He emphasized the importance of nurturing a strong middle class and ensuring that prosperity is attainable for future generations. Obama argued that his predecessor's administration was responsible for the fiscal crisis, referencing failed policies that handed out tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy at the expense of average American families. Furthermore, he noted that Romney's proposals echoed those of previous administrations, which ultimately led to the economic collapse. On the other hand, Romney's economic plan revolved around reducing federal spending and taxes, easing government regulations, and encouraging entrepreneurship. He contended that Obama's administration stifled economic recovery by excessively regulating businesses and increasing the federal deficit. Romney argued that the free market should be allowed to function without excessive government involvement, stating that the private sector was best suited to create jobs and stimulate overall growth. He maintained that the implementation of these strategies would ultimately strengthen the economy and boost job creation, leading to a more prosperous future for all Americans. Both candidates sought to address prevalent issues such as high unemployment rates, declining wages, increasing federal debt, and financial instability. However, their strategies to address these challenges were significantly different: while Obama leaned on the government’s involvement and investment, Romney advocated for deregulation and minimal intervention. Though white voters were divided in their opinions about the most effective approach to stimulate the economy, they had to carefully analyze the candidates’ proposals and assess which economic strategy aligned with their beliefs and values. The outcome of November's election would rely heavily on voters' faith in either Obama's dedication to build a more equal and sustainable society or Romney's faith in the free market and limited government intervention. The 2012 presidential race further reinforced the necessity of open dialogue and informed decision-making, as citizens recognized the profound impact their preferred candidate's policies would have on the nation's economic recovery and future growth."},{"instruction":"Article: This is a common myth held by students. Particularly if you’re a slow reader, you may find it more effective to read the beginning and end of the chapter, along with pull-outs (information placed in a box, graph, or other attention-grabbing area on the page) and anything bolded or italicized in the text. Another common mistake students make is to read their textbook once and then never look at it again. A better strategy is to practice layered reading. On your first read-through, skim the material. Determine what the main idea or goal of the text is (often signaled by the chapter title and subheadings), and mark any places that you didn’t feel as though you understood well. Read headings, subheadings, and other organizational elements. Textbook authors often construct their chapters so that it is very clear what the goal of each section is. Use this to your advantage. Read for more detail in later readings. Sometimes, students will just move their eyes along the page again and again and feel like they’re not getting anything from their “reading.” Reading is an active process: you need to be engaged, paying attention, and thinking about what you read. While it’s tempting to break out the rainbow of highlighters when you read through a chapter, avoid this temptation. Research has shown that highlighting actually can hamper your reading because you may feel tempted to highlight every single thing you feel is important without thinking critically about the ideas presented. If you must highlight, wait until you’ve completed your first read-through, and use the highlighter sparingly to point out only the most important ideas. It can be tempting to just read past words or elements you don’t understand in an effort to “just get it done.” This actually damages comprehension. If a dense textbook on Marxist economics has terms that you don’t initially understand, don’t just read on: stop what you’re doing, look up the word, and understand it before continuing.

The author suggests that slow readers can benefit from reading the beginning and end of chapters, focusing on pull-outs, and bolded or italicized text. Layered reading is introduced as a more efficient approach, where the first read-through involves skimming the material, identifying main ideas and marking challenging parts; followed by more in-depth readings. The author emphasizes active engagement and critical thinking during the reading process. They also advise against excessive highlighting during the first read, as it can hamper comprehension. Instead, highlighting should be sparingly used and only for the most important ideas. It is also important to address any unfamiliar terms or concepts and not to simply read past them.

Imagine if you had the biggest, best playground ever. This playground has a part where you can play golf, and it's in a city called Incheon. Incheon is really, really far away, all the way in South Korea! This is not just a golf course though, it also has a spa, where you can relax just like when mommy goes to get her massages. There are rooms where you can have a quiet nap, too, just like in preschool, but for big people, and even a special garden indoors! It's like having a park, but inside where it won't get rained on! And get this, they also have something called a casino, but that’s a place where adults play their own kind of games. Now, in this very special place, lots of people were asked what they thought about it.

Incheon’s playground was so amazing that it was really close to win against other really cool playgrounds in places called Hong Kong and Singapore. They also have very big, very cool airports.

They spent their days exploring the woods, riding bikes through the streets, and sharing family dinners over joyful laughter. But what no one else knew was that Jackie harbored a secret. Ever since she could remember, she had felt a profound, abiding love for her older brother. It was a love that transcended the ordinary bonds of sibling affection, though she could never find the courage to share her feelings with him. As they grew older, this unrequited passion cast a quiet shadow over their relationship. Through every stage of life, this secret pang of desire gnawed at Jackie's heart. No matter how many times her classmates or friends would giggle and tease her about the boys at school, or how many times her parents would jokingly speculate about her future husband, Jackie stood by her love for Matthew, a love that he would never return. In the radiant glow of their idyllic childhood, everything seemed possible. However, even in this sun-drenched world, there were unmistakable signs that adolescence was dawning, and with it came the necessity of facing adulthood. The terrible harbinger of change itself knocked on their door in the form of a text message. Matthew was preparing for his senior year of high school and was no stranger to the romantic advances of the girls who watched him from afar, openly admiring his charm, intelligence, and athleticism. He began dating a girl named Yolanda, who was widely considered to be one of the most popular girls in their grade. Despite her wishes to the contrary, Jackie couldn't help but observe how well-suited Matthew and Yolanda seemed. This revelation struck her heart like a thunderbolt, shattering her dreams of a life lived hand-in-hand with her beloved brother. Then, the final blow came. One afternoon, as the town gave way to the forgiving warmth of summer, Matthew stormed into the living room, his face contorted in a fury of emotion. As he slammed his phone onto the table, Jackie learned that Matthew had broken up with Yolanda due to a bitter argument, signaled by a single text message. The words on the screen seemed to cry out in a cacophony of dashed hopes, untold truths, and endless heartache. As the summer stretched golden tendrils of light through the trees and into their lives, Jackie made a vow to herself. With the knowledge of Matthew's newfound freedom, she would make the most of the summer days to come, hoping that in the fire of those moments, she might be able to mend her own broken heart. And so, Jackie and Matthew set about creating a summer to remember, planning trips, outings, and nights under the stars that would become some of the most cherished memories of their lifetime. The pinnacle of this dreamlike summer came in the form of a concert, where they danced away to the music of their favorite bands. It was there, in that sea of joyful exuberance, that Jackie could almost, for a fleeting moment, believe that she and Matthew were more than just brother and sister. The time stood still, and the world around them dissolved in a haze of song and dance. But as the sun began to dip below the horizon, the veil of enchantment slowly faded as well. The approaching autumn heralded a new season of life, one that would see Matthew leave for college in a distant city. It was a reminder that the respite Jackie had sought was but a temporary interlude, as grief and loss would now encroach upon her once-hopeful heart. The summer had been a balm for Jackie's soul, a beautiful distraction from the turmoil lurking beneath the surface. Yet, as the first cool breezes of fall began to brush through their town, she understood that her heart would never truly be free from the love that had blossomed during those golden days of innocence. Jackie could only stand and watch as the now-fading summer itself mirrored her heart, as her beloved brother's departure drew near, her grief waning in tandem with the warm days of youth. In the cold light of reality, she knew that she would have to face her unspoken love and learn to accept that it could never be more than a secret harbored in the deepest recesses of her heart. And so, as she watched Matthew pack his bags for college, Jackie could only hope that the intervening years would grant her the wisdom and the strength to finally let go, to embrace the love that she could find in living, and to leave behind the haunting dream of an impossible love."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Dear Guys, I'd like to talk to you about the two minutes of total embarrassments you put me through last night. You a group of fit, young men, were playing soccer on the field across from my apartment building, I, a beautiful looking young woman, was walking by with my groceries. That's when your ball came flying over the fence and landed at my feet. One of you came to me, and asked politely if I would throw the ball back to you. Fighting the urge to flee screaming down the street, I agreed. And I put my bags down, picked up the ball and with eyes half shut, threw it as hard as I could. It hit the middle of the fence and bounced right back to me. I picked up the ball again and threw the ball upward with all my strength. The ball once again hit slightly higher up on the fence and bounced back to me. This is the point where I start to blame you. Wouldn't it have been a better use of your time, and mine, if you had just walked around the fence and collected the ball then? I was clearly struggling. And yet you all just stood there, staring. Seeing that you weren't going to get the ball yourselves, I become desperate. But I picked up the soccer ball for the third time. I forced a smile while crying inside as you patiently shouted words of support over the fence at me like I was a two-year-old holding a beech ball for the first time. \\"Throw it granny-style!\\" one of you said. \\"Just back up a little end throw it hard!\\" another offered And, most embarrassing of all, \\"You can do it!\\" I know you thought you were being encouraging, but it only served to deepen the embarrassment.

It has been called an \\"architectural gem\\" and was featured by Dan Cruickshank in the BBC television series Around the World in 80 Treasures. From 1966 to 1993 the spire of St James' appeared on the Australian Australian ten-dollar note among other Greenway buildings. In 1973, the church appeared on a 50 cent postage stamp, one of four in a series illustrating Australian architecture issued to commemorate the opening of the Sydney Opera House. The Old Supreme Court building, also designed by Greenway with alternations by others, located next to the church is of the same date. Across the square is Greenway's \\"masterpiece\\", the UNESCO World Heritage listed-Hyde Park Barracks, designed to align with the church. Beside the barracks stands Sydney's oldest public building, part of the General Hospital built in 1811 and now known as the Mint Building. Separated from the Mint by the present-day Sydney Hospital is Parliament House, Sydney, of which the central section is a further part of the early hospital, and is now home to the New South Wales State Parliament.The church was constructed between 1820 and 1824 with later additions made in 1834 by John Verge who designed the vestries at the eastern end. Apart from these vestries, which retain the established style and proportions, the church externally remains \\"fine Georgian\\" much as Greenway conceived it. Relying on the \\"virtues of simplicity and proportion to achieve his end\\", Greenway maintained the classical tradition, unaffected by the Revivalist styles that were being promoted in London at the time he arrived in the colony. He planned the church to align with his earlier Hyde Park Barracks, constructed in 1817–19. The two buildings have similar proportions, pilasters and gables and together constitute an important example of town-planning.

Context: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger.

Lysaker is the easternmost part of Bærum, and borders Oslo proper. Lysaker was initially a farming community, later becoming a residential area. Today it is primarily known as a business and trade area, and a public transport hub. It is considered part of Stor-Oslo (Greater Oslo), and is home to offices of numerous domestic and international businesses. - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German). - Harald Sigurdsson (Old Norse: \\"Haraldr Sigurðarson\\"; c. 1015 25 September 1066), given the epithet Hardrada (\\"harðráði\\", roughly translated as \\"stern counsel\\" or \\"hard ruler\\") in the sagas, was King of Norway (as Harald III) from 1046 to 1066.

Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean.

Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - Norse Energy ( OSE : NEC ) is a petroleum and natural gas exploration and production as well as pipeline operator .

The largest island Mainland is often referred to as \\"the Mainland\\". It has an area of , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles. The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall. - Haakon V Magnusson (10 April 1270 - 8 May 1319) (Old Norse: \\"Hákon Magnússon\\"; Norwegian: \\"Håkon Magnusson\\") was king of Norway from 1299 until 1319. - Ecuador, officially the Republic of Ecuador (which literally translates as \\"Republic of the Equator\\"), is a representative democratic republic in northwestern South America, bordered by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Ecuador also includes the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about west of the mainland. - The Americas, also collectively called America, encompass the totality of the continents of North America and South America. Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the \\"New World\\". - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Oslo is the capital and the most populous city in Norway. It constitutes both a county and a municipality. Founded in the year 1040, and established as a \\"kaupstad\\" or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada, the city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (\\"formannskapsdistrikt\\") on 1 January 1838. Following a spelling reform, it was known as Kristiania from 1877 to 1925, at which time its original Norwegian name was restored. - Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast. It is bordered by Dalsland to the northeast, Västergötland to the southeast, the Skagerrak arm of the North Sea to the west, and the county of Østfold, in Norway, to the north. - The Scandinavian Peninsula (; \\"Skandinavsky poluostrov\\") is a peninsula in Northern Europe, which generally comprises the mainland of Sweden, the mainland of Norway (with the exception of a small coastal area bordering Russia), the northwestern area of Finland, as well as a narrow area in the west of the Pechengsky District of Russia. - History. The introduction of self-government in rural districts was a major political change. The Norwegian farm culture (\\"bondekultur\\") that emerged came to serve as a symbol of nationalistic resistance to the forced union with Sweden. The legislation of 1837 gave both the towns and the rural areas the same institutions: a minor change for the town, but a major advance for the rural communities. The significance of this legislation is hailed by a nationalistic historian, Ernst Sars: - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller Sør-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north. The isthmus is the location of the two largest lakes of the island, Sørlaguna (South Lagoon), and Nordlaguna (North Lagoon). A third lake is called Ullerenglaguna (Ullereng Lagoon). Jan Mayen was formed by the Jan Mayen hotspot. - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland.

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Bærum is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Sandvika. Bærum was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838. A suburb of Oslo, Bærum is located on the west coast of the city.

Question 2: Why most of the South Indian people don't talk in Hindi? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking for a list of great Indians who are not well-known, while Question 2 seeks an explanation of why most of the South Indian people don't speak in Hindi. I will address both questions below. Question 1: Who are some great Indians that most people have not heard of? There are several unsung heroes in India who have made considerable contributions to various fields and positively impacted society. Here are a few such individuals: 1. Udupi Ramachandra Rao - A renowned space scientist, he played a significant role in the development of India's satellite programs and contributed immensely to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Under his leadership, India became the first country in the world to successfully launch Moon and Mars orbiters in their first attempts. 2. Sonam Wangchuk - An engineer, innovator, and education reformer, Wangchuk is the inspiration behind the character 'Phunsukh Wangdu' in the Bollywood movie \\"3 Idiots.\\" He founded the Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL), an organization that has revolutionized the education system in Ladakh. In addition, he has devised innovative solutions like the Ice Stupa, an artificial glacier for water conservation purposes. 3. Dr. Suman Sahai - A geneticist and founder of the non-profit organization Gene Campaign, she has fought tirelessly for farmers' rights and the conservation of agricultural biodiversity in India. Her efforts have brought attention to the issue of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their potential impact on Indian agriculture. 4. Sir Chintaman D. Deshmukh - The first Indian to serve as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, his visionary leadership helped shape the economic and financial policies of independent India. 5. Palagummi Padmaraju - A scientist who contributed immensely to the field of high-density optical storage, he was part of the team that invented the Blu-ray Disc technology. Question 2: Why don't most South Indian people speak in Hindi? South India has a rich linguistic diversity, with the primary languages being Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam. There are several reasons why the majority of South Indians don't typically speak Hindi: 1. Distinct Language Families - While Hindi is an Indo-Aryan language primarily spoken in North India, the languages of South India belong to the Dravidian family. Since they are entirely different in their linguistic roots, traditions, and scripts, it is not a cultural or social norm for South Indians to speak Hindi. 2. History of Regional Languages - The South Indian states have a long history of literary and cultural traditions in their regional languages, predating even the arrival of Indo-Aryan speakers in North India. As a result, these regional languages hold significant cultural and historical value for the people, rendering the adoption of Hindi less appealing. 3. Regional Identity - The diverse linguistic and cultural background of South India fosters a strong regional identity, and people take immense pride in preserving their languages. The use of indigenous languages is seen as a symbol of regional pride and cultural preservation. 4. Hindi Imposition – There has been a history of political opposition to the imposition of Hindi as India's official language. The Indian constitution recognizes multiple languages, and many South Indians feel that the linguistic imposition undermines the diversity and federal structure of the nation. 5. Linguistic Aptitude – Due to the vast differences in grammar, vocabulary, and script between the Dravidian languages and Hindi, South Indians may encounter substantial difficulties in learning and speaking Hindi. Consequently, some may choose to focus on their native languages and English, which serves as an additional neutral language that allows for greater communication across linguistic barriers within India and internationally. In conclusion, while questions 1 and 2 pertain to India, they address different topics. The first question focuses on lesser-known great individuals from India, while the second question explores the reasons behind South Indians' limited use of Hindi. Both questions highlight the diversity and variety within Indian culture, history, and language."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"Family of people right before they crash to their deaths on shoddy roller coaster.\\" can we conclude that \\"Family of people willing to save the belongings of the person.\\"?

That theory, at least, is on the minds of archaeologists and historians in Reading, about 40 miles west of London, who this week will begin searching for the high altar of the abbey founded by King Henry I. They believe that the altar — and, they hope, the king’s remains — could be under the parking lot of a local prison, near the abbey ruins. The area around a nearby nursery school will also be searched. Nearly four years ago, archaeologists discovered King Richard III’s grave under a parking lot in Leicester, about 100 miles northwest of London, on the site of a former monastery. 100 Miles SCOTLAND North Sea N. IRELAND BRITAIN Irish Sea IRELAND Leicester ENGLAND WALES London Reading Celtic Sea FRANCE English Channel Henry I, who ruled from 1100 to 1135, reportedly died after eating lampreys, a kind of jawless fish. A son of William the Conqueror, who ascended to the throne after the death of his elder brother William II, Henry has been described as a usurper because he seized the crown while another elder brother was away on a Crusade. Henry also had a reputation for cruelty; he is said to have had the tips of the noses of two of his granddaughters cut off. But he is also credited with strengthening the monarchy and putting in place efficient — if sometimes oppressive — administrative policies. John Mullaney, a historian who is part of the team undertaking the search, said that archaeologists knew “within a few yards” where Henry was probably buried. He said the team would use ground-penetrating radar to search the area around the prison, and around a nearby nursery school. Photo “We know from burial records that Henry was buried in front of the high altar in the old abbey,” Mr. Mullaney said in a telephone interview. “The aim is to find the footprint of the old abbey. We don’t know if his remains will still be there.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story As to whether a former monarch would roll in his grave at the prospect of spending eternity under a parking lot, Mr. Mullaney was philosophical. Photo “I’m afraid that England is a nation of car drivers,” he said. “We are a small country and most people travel by cars, so we need lots of car parks. Henry was a reforming king and would have been fascinated by the idea of cars and transport, and may well have liked being buried under a car park.” The historian’s wife, Lindsay Mullaney, a linguist and amateur historian who is also involved in the search, said that Henry was a ladies’ man who fathered 24 children outside of marriage. “He was addicted to lust,” she said by telephone. He died in Normandy, which at the time was part of his realm. His decaying body was brought back to Britain and he was buried in Reading Abbey, which, she said, he had hoped would become the mausoleum of future kings. Mr. Mullaney said that Henry, as a man of learning, would have preferred being buried under a school or, even better, in a place of worship: “He was a religious man and so I think he would have preferred being buried in a church.” Until Richard III’s bones were discovered in Leicester, his grave had been unmarked for over 500 years. He was buried by men who killed him at the Battle of Bosworth. The bones were transferred, with much ceremony, to a new tomb in Leicester Cathedral in March 2015. ||||| Surveyors have begun scouring the land around the ruins of Reading Abbey, as part of a search that could unearth the missing remains of King Henry I. Investigators began using ground-penetrating radar on Friday, in a bid to outline the extent of the grounds of the ruined abbey, in a search that could see the body of a second English king discovered beneath a car park. Henry, who died in 1135, reportedly from a “surfeit of lampreys”, is thought to have been buried alongside his second wife, Adeliza, under the high altar of the abbey, which was largely destroyed during Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries. |||||Summary:","output":"Archaeologists and historians in Reading are searching for the high altar of an abbey founded by King Henry I because they believe the king's remains might be under a local prison's parking lot, near the abbey ruins. They are going to use a special tool called ground-penetrating radar to look for the king's remains. King Henry I ruled a long time ago, from 1100 to 1135, and he was famous for making the government work better. A few years ago, another king, King Richard III, was found under a parking lot too. This shows that sometimes very important history can be hidden beneath ordinary places."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the full name of the eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field? Answer the above question based on the context below: Immediately southeast of Mount Cayley lies Mount Fee, an extensively eroded volcano containing a north-south trending ridge. It has an elevation of 2,162 m (7,093 ft) and is one of the older volcanic features in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. Its volcanics are undated, but its large amount of dissection and evidence of glacial ice overriding the volcano indicates that it formed more than 75,000 years ago before the Wisconsinan Glaciation. Therefore, volcanism at Mount Fee does not display evidence of interaction with glacial ice. The remaining products from Fee's earliest volcanic activity is a minor portion of pyroclastic rock. This is evidence of explosive volcanism from Fee's eruptive history, as well as its first volcanic event. The second volcanic event produced a sequence of lavas and breccias on the eastern flank of the main ridge. These volcanics were likely deposited when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a volcanic vent and moved down the flanks during the construction of a large volcano. Following extensive dissection, renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lava flows forming its narrow, flat-topped, steep-sided northern limit and the northern end of the main ridge. The conduit for which these lava flows originated from was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older volcanics deposited during Fee's earlier volcanic events. This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion, and likely one or more glacial periods. Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north-south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark.Pali Dome, located north and northeast of Mount Cayley, is an eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field. Like Cauldron Dome, it consists of two geological units. Pail Dome East is composed of a mass of andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic material. It lies on the eastern portion of the Powder Mountain Icefield. Much of the lava flows form...

You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below. The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning.

Article: A blue hole is a flooded sea cave with a hole that opens up at the land's surface. These cave systems form in carbonate rock, often on islands. Some blue holes have very special rock formations and water chemistry. Far below sea level, they contain some of the harshest environments on Earth, with no oxygen and no light. Yet these areas are filled with life forms that have adapted to the extreme conditions. Information gathered from these blue holes is helping scientists to increase their understanding of biology, archaeology and geology. But exploring these blue hole environments brings danger as well as discovery. Blue holes get their name from the color1 some have when seen from the air. The color1 is usually a reflection of the sky on the water. But not all of these cave systems have blue surfaces. Some contain dark or muddy water. Blue holes are the result of erosion in which water breaks down rock. Rain falling thousands of years ago contained chemicals which slowly wore away at the limestone landmass. These holes were later filled with sea water as the sea level changed. The rising and falling of sea levels and the mixture of salt and fresh water further wore away at these cave formations. Blue holes are vertical caves. But they can also have horizontal cave formations that may be hundreds of meters long. These flooded cave systems can be found in the ocean, or they can be found inland. Ocean caves are affected by tides, so they always have water movement. But blue holes on land are very still. They have several layers of water, chemicals, and bacteria. The top layer of fresh water comes from rainfall. This layer acts like a cap on top of the layered mixture, and keeps out oxygen from the atmosphere. The fresh water floats on a denser layer of saltwater. Underneath this is a layer of poisonous hydrogen sulfide, produced by bacteria living in the water. Underneath this layer is anoxic seawater -- water that does not contain any oxygen. Underwater caves are probably one of the least explored ecosystems...

If you have a bad dream and can’t forget it, find a way to distract your mind. You could get out of bed for a few minutes. Consider watching peaceful images of a beach or mountains from a sleep or meditation app on one of your devices. Leave your bedroom for a bit and sit or lie someplace relaxing. Turn on a dim light if that helps you feel better. Read, watch a funny show, or listen to soft music, all of which can divert your attention from the nightmare. Show a pet some love, which can calm you and help you forget the dream. Talking to your pet may also help you. For example, stroke your cat and say, “Hello Socks, would you like to snuggle for a bit? What a good kitty you are. Listen to you purr. That makes me happy.” Load apps on one of your devices that promote sleep and/ or meditation. These often have soothing music and images that can distract your mind and relax you. Cognitive reframing is a technique that has you step back from a situation and alter its various aspects. Change out terrifying parts of a bad dream positive images. Reframing the storyline of your bad dream with different and happy images can help you forget its details. In turn, this can help you relax and get back to sleep. Keep in mind how often you forget dreams in the process of thinking about other things. Reframing your bad dream in alternative terms can help you forget it just as quickly as other dreams. Switch the storyline of the bad dream as soon as you wake up. Remove whatever upsets you by thinking about it or even writing it in a journal you keep next to your bed. This is especially useful because handwriting is closely associated with memory. Replace the bad elements of the dream for something happy and positive. For example, if you dream that a whale capsizes your boat, tell yourself or write, “A giant whale swam next to us and then guided us to a tropical paradise.” Avoid assigning meaning to your dreams as well. Remind yourself that dreams are just a product of your brain’s processing functions. They do not indicate something about you or about the future. Try not to assign meaning to the dream or to try to interpret the dream. If you want to consider the dream further, then do so later on when you are feeling calm. Dim lights can provide comfort in the dark of the night. Turn on your nightlight or small lamp next to your bed as soon as you wake up from a bad dream. This can relax and re-orient you to your surroundings. Choose a light in a soothing color that won’t stimulate your body to wake up. Hues in the red, yellow, or orange range are the best choices. Set the light near your bed so that you can turn it on easily when you wake up from a bad dream. If you have a clock in your bedroom or next to your bed, turn it so that you can’t see the time. Watching time pass can make the physical and emotional distress from a bad dream worse. Ignoring your clock can help you forget the dream and get back to sleep more quickly. What you smell can positively affect your mood and your dreams. If you wake up from a bad dream, place some fresh flowers or an aromatherapy oil next to or near your bed. These may help soothe your thoughts, relax you, and help you fall back asleep. Consider some of the following scents: Coconut Jasmine Lavender Marjoram Peppermint Rose Vanilla Grounding exercises can help to reduce anxiety and calm yourself down after something frightening has happened. If your bad dream has left you feeling shaken, then doing a grounding exercise may help you to feel better. Most grounding exercises require you to engage with the five senses. A simple exercise that you can do is to name or write: Five things in the room that you can see. You might see a clock, a picture, your cat, a lamp, and a dresser. Four things you can feel. You might feel the blankets on your skin, your pillow, cool air on your face, and your cat’s fur. Three things you can hear. You might hear a car passing by, your cat purring, and the sound of a fan. Two things you can smell. You might smell the lotion on your arms and the scent of fresh rain coming in through your window. One thing you like about yourself or that other people like. You might note that one good thing about yourself is that you are kind to people. Summary:","output":"To overcome a bad dream, distract your mind by watching peaceful images, changing your environment, or engaging in relaxing activities like reading, watching a funny show, or listening to soft music. Showing love to a pet and talking to them can also help. Use sleep and meditation apps to further relax your mind. Practice cognitive reframing to replace negative dream details with positive imagery. Avoid assigning meaning to dreams and remind yourself they are just brain functions. Turn on a dim light to provide comfort, but avoid looking at the time on your clock. Utilize pleasant scents like lavender and jasmine to create a soothing atmosphere. Finally, perform grounding exercises that engage with your five senses to reduce anxiety and calm yourself after a bad dream."},{"instruction":"Given the below context: The film centers around 10-year-old intelligent Elijah Butler living in New York.

I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live.

Because Toto now lives outside,she eats and drinks outside.I' ve set up a heating pad on the porch.and given her own food and water area nearby.She seems perfectly content with this arrangement except when she's out of food,or she wants to be petted. Strangely enough,she's been out of food a lot lately.\\"I think another cat is eating Toto's food.\\"I told Kris when I first noticed how quickly she was going through her bowl. \\"Actually,\\"I said a couple of days later,\\"maybe it's a dog.Whoever is eating Toto's food keeps knocking the bowl over.\\" But a few days after that,I realized that the food thief probably wasn't even a dog.Whatever the critter was,it was messy. Every morning,Toto's water dish was filled with mud.The food bowl was tipped over and the porch scattered with mud and debris .\\"I' ll bet it's a coon ,\\"I told Kris.Though we live in a residential neighborhood not far from Portland,we' ve seen plenty of raccoons in the six years since we moved in. Today I got to see the cat-food thievery first-hand.Turns out it's not one raccoon-it's a family of four.I was lucky enough to have my camera handy as they performed their daring raid:My favorite part of this video is how Toto simply sits on her heating pad and watches the raccoons eat her food.She isn't bothered at all.

Based on the text provided, Petru wants the giant to swear that he will carry him across the river in exchange for an honorable fight. Given the giant's agreement to this request, it would be reasonable to assume that the next sentence might involve the beginning of their fight or a continuation of their discussion.

Given the popularity and legendary status of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, we can infer that the character has inspired several stories in different parts of the world. As a cultural icon associated with Christmas, it is reasonable to assume that storytellers, writers, and other creators from various places would be inspired to create stories based on or involving Rudolph."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of integers. For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list. Q: [[-25, 7, -25, -9, -34], [-39, -37, 29, -22, 20], [9, -20, 35, -7], [11, 10], [-44, 26, 1], [23, -41], [30, 47], [-36, 43, -6, 36, 41], [-36, 49, -13], [-7, -43, 30, 7, 16], [49, -12, 20], [19, -20, -47]] A:","output":"This task asks you to handle a list of lists, where each of the inner lists contains a collection of integers. Here are the guidelines the task provides: 1. All of the lists are contained within an \\"outer\\" list. 2. Each list inside the outer list contains several numbers, which are positive or negative integers. 3. You are asked to multiply every odd number in each inner list, managing separately each list. 4. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list, you should then output 0 for that particular list. Now, here's how you can approach this task with those guidelines in mind: 1. Start by defining a function to multiply all odd integers in a list. 2. The function should iterate through each integer in the list. For each integer, it should check if it's odd. (An integer is odd if the remainder when dividing by 2 is not zero. You can use the modulus operator \`%\` for this function: \`number % 2 != 0\` will return \`True\` if the number is odd and \`False\` if it's even.) 3. If the integer is odd, it should multiply it with the previous result. It would be best to initialize the result with 1 since multiplying with 1 does not change the number. 4. If the integer is even, it should ignore it and continue to the next integer. 5. If after checking through all the numbers and none is odd, the multiplication result remains 1, the function should then return 0. 6. Now create another function or a loop to apply this function for every inner list in your main list. 7. Collect the result for each list in a new list. This will be your final output, a list of multiplications of odd numbers from each inner list. By following these steps, you should be able to deliver a list, where each element corresponds to the product of the odd integers in the inner lists from the original input list, or a 0 if there were no odd integers in the corresponding inner lists."},{"instruction":"Question: What do non-cuticle annelids use to protect their skin? Is \\"Some annelids also have oblique internal muscles that connect the underside of the body to each side.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Non-cuticle annelids, like other annelids, need mechanisms to protect their skin. The answer you provided, \\"Some annelids also have oblique internal muscles that connect the underside of the body to each side,\\" is not directly related to skin protection. Those oblique internal muscles play an essential role in locomotion and maintaining the body shape of the organism. To answer the question, let's look at some of the ways non-cuticle annelids protect their skin: 1. Mucus production: One of the primary ways non-cuticle annelids protect their skin is through the secretion of mucus. The mucus serves as a physical barrier that keeps the skin moist, prevents desiccation, and provides protection against parasites, predators, and pathogens. In some species, the mucus may also contain toxins or unappealing chemicals to deter predators. 2. Epidermal cells with microvilli or cilia: Some non-cuticle annelids have specialized epidermal cells that contain microvilli or cilia on their surface. These structures help improve the exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products between the environment and the organism. By having a more efficient exchange system, these annelids can maintain their skin health and prevent infections. 3. Regeneration: Annelids are famously known for their regenerative capabilities. If an annelid's skin is damaged, it can rapidly regrow the lost tissue, ensuring its skin remains functional and well-protected. 4. Setae or chaetae: Annalids possess hair-like structures called setae or chaetae, made of chitin, that protrude from their body. While these structures primarily assist with locomotion, they may also provide some level of physical protection for the skin. 5. Epidermal pigments: Some annelids have pigments in their epidermal layer that can help protect their skin against UV radiation, reducing the risk of tissue damage and providing a form of camouflage against predators. In summary, non-cuticle annelids use a combination of strategies to protect their skin, including mucus production, specialized epidermal cells, regeneration, setae/chaetae, and pigments. It's essential to understand that these mechanisms can act synergistically, ensuring the organism's skin remains healthy and protected in various environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"Dylan Tombides was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2011.

Analyzing the phrase: The phrase states \\"attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one.\\" Here, the subject seems to be trying to combine or improve three separate scenarios that are described as \\"dull.\\" The intended outcome is to create \\"one good\\" plot. 2. Evaluation of the attempt: The effort to turn something dull into something good could be seen as a positive action because it shows a desire to improve and make things better. The fact that there's an attempt being made can be considered as a positive aspect. 3. Evaluation of the dull plots: The plots being described as \\"dull\\" has a negative connotation because it implies that they are not interesting or engaging. This can be seen as the negative aspect of the phrase. 4. Balancing the positive and negative: The phrase contains both positive (attempt to improve) and negative (dull plots) elements. However, it seems that the overall intention of the phrase is to point out a flaw or critique regarding the plots being combined. Conclusion: This phrase leans more towards being negative because it emphasizes the dull plots' inadequacy and provides a subtle critique. The positive aspect of attempting to fuse the plots together seems insufficient to offset the negative connotation."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: The ferocity of later Cretan resistance against the Turks had all the trademarks of their fiercely independent spirit.

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower.

Earth’s magnetic poles are not the same as the geographic poles. Q: Earth’s magnetic north and south poles are not the same as what? A: A:","output":"Earth's magnetic north and south poles are not the same as the geographic north and south poles. The distinction between these two sets of poles lies in the way they are defined and their physical properties. The geographic north and south poles refer to the points on Earth where the planet's axis of rotation intersects with its surface. They serve as an essential reference for any geographic coordinate system and are crucial in the study of Earth's geography and in map-making. Reaching the geographic poles means one has reached the northernmost or southernmost point on Earth. On the other hand, the magnetic north and south poles are the points on Earth where the planet's magnetic field lines converge (north pole) and diverge (south pole). These poles are not stationary, as they continually shift due to changes in Earth's magnetic field over time. The magnetic poles are responsible for Earth's magnetic field, which protects the planet from harmful solar radiation and plays a vital role in navigation by means of instruments like compasses. So, in summary, Earth's magnetic north and south poles are not the same as the geographic north and south poles due to their distinct definitions, locations, and the phenomena they are associated with. The geographic poles are tied to Earth's rotation, whereas the magnetic poles are related to Earth's changing magnetic field."},{"instruction":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Robert Wilson's left all of his fortune to charity with the exception of gifts to his assistant of 20 years and his business manager.

Why is Sehwag so damn irritating and why do people & media glorify his lameness? Why is drupal so damn complicated? I thought it was to help people who don't know code.","output":"Although both questions involve a complaint or sentiment of dissatisfaction, the two questions are not the same, as they relate to different subjects and areas of expertise. The first question concerns a cricket player named Virender Sehwag and his public persona, whereas the second concerns the Drupal content management system. Here is an extended analysis of both questions: 1. \\"Why is Sehwag so damn irritating and why do people & media glorify his lameness?\\" This question addresses the controversial nature or public image of Virender Sehwag, a former Indian cricketer and one of the most successful openers in international cricket. The individual asking the question seems to find Sehwag's behavior or attitude irritating. It's important to note that people's opinions about public figures are inherently subjective, and what one person sees as irritating or obnoxious in an individual, another might find charismatic or entertaining. In addressing the second part of the question, the promotion of Sehwag's \\"lameness\\" (as the questioner puts it) by people and media might be attributed to several factors: a) Cricket is a popular sport in India, making cricket players celebrities with considerable media attention. b) Controversial or polarizing figures often generate increased media coverage and public discussions. c) Sehwag's accomplishments during his playing career lend credibility to his perspective, even if his views are sometimes seen as controversial. It's worth mentioning that it is normal to have differing opinions on a public figure, as people's perceptions vary based on their own personal experiences, values, and biases. 2. \\"Why is Drupal so damn complicated? I thought it was to help people who don't know code.\\" Drupal is an open-source content management system (CMS) and development platform, designed to help people build and maintain websites without having to write code from scratch. The question here focuses on the perceived complexity of the Drupal system. There are several reasons why Drupal might be seen as \\"complicated\\": a) Steep learning curve: Drupal has a reputation for having a steep learning curve, particularly when compared to CMS platforms like WordPress or Joomla. It requires a deeper understanding of the system and its terminology to effectively build and manage websites with it. b) Flexibility and customization: Drupal is known for its flexibility and high degree of customization potential. This power often results in increased complexity, as users may need to learn site configuration, module integration, and development concepts to fully utilize the platform. c) Growing with technology: As website technologies evolve and user expectations shift, Drupal, like other CMS platforms, continuously updates and improves its features. Sometimes, these changes result in added complexity or require users to learn new approaches to accomplish the desired task. d) Developer-oriented design: While Drupal aims to make website development accessible to non-programmers, the platform does have many developer-friendly tools and features which can contribute to its perceived complexity for those without coding experience. It's important to understand that individual experiences with Drupal, or any CMS platform, will vary based on an individual's background, technical proficiency, and willingness to learn. Some people may find Drupal to be an excellent tool for their needs, while others may have a preferred alternative they find more straightforward or intuitive."},{"instruction":"What is the minimum marks required in Neet exam for getting MBBS seat? what is the minimum marks required in Neet exam for getting mbbs seat ?

His parents, Simon and Gertrude Hope, were immigrants from the Caribbean, and had several children. Elmo began playing the piano aged seven. He had classical music lessons as a child, and won solo piano recital contests from 1938. Context: Unable to earn a living in New York because of the performance ban, Hope toured with trumpeter Chet Baker in 1957 and then began living in Los Angeles. He soon found other musicians who had been influenced by bebop, including saxophonist Harold Land and bassist Curtis Counce. Hope played with Rollins again, and, in October 1957, recorded a session known as The Elmo Hope Quintet Featuring Harold Land which Pacific Jazz did not release until 1962, along with the contents of a 1957 Jazz Messengers album. In March of the following year, Hope became part of Counce's band, and went on to record two albums with the bassist. Hope also did some arranging for others around this time, including for Land's 1958 Harold in the Land of Jazz. Hope also had his own band, with personnel that varied, and in 1959 he played with Lionel Hampton in Hollywood. Later that year, after performances in San Francisco with two quartets - the first containing Rollins, bassist Scott LaFaro, and drummer Lenny McBrowne; the other with Rollins replaced by Land - Hope travelled north with the Land group to play at a venue in Vancouver. Back in Los Angeles in August 1959, Hope was pianist for Land's quintet album The Fox; he also wrote four of the album's compositions. This recording, along with Elmo Hope Trio from the same year, were, in the opinion of jazz historian David Rosenthal, illustrative of Hope's musical development on the West Coast. The trio album received a rare five-star review from Down Beat magazine, with the comment that Hope's aesthetic was \\"a sort of bitter-sweet melancholy that seems to lie at the core of other jazzmen [...] who sometimes find the world 'a bit much', as the English say, to cope with.\\" In 1960, Hope married the pianist Bertha Rosemond (better known as Bertha Hope), whom he met in California. As a jazz musician on the West Coast, Hope found his life frustrating. In his only major published interview (written up for Down Beat in January 1961 and entitled \\"Bitter Hope\\"), he criticized the lack of creativity in the then-popular church-influenced soul jazz, complained about the shortage of good musicians in Los Angeles, and lamented the lack of work opportunities in the few jazz clubs in the area. Hope left Los Angeles later in 1961. His wife recounted that he was no longer working with Land, had recording offers from companies based on the East Coast, and still preferred it to Los Angeles, so the couple and their baby daughter moved to New York. Question: did it win awards?. Whats the answer?","output":"Although Elmo Hope's work received critical acclaim and appreciation from fellow musicians and jazz enthusiasts, there is no specific mention of him winning any major awards during his lifetime. His Elmo Hope Trio album received a rare five-star review from Down Beat magazine, which is a significant recognition within the jazz community. However, this does not equate to an award. Despite the lack of notable awards, Hope's musical contributions, particularly in bebop and hard bop, had a lasting impact on the jazz genre and influenced many musicians. His compositional and piano-playing skills were highly respected, but unfortunately, they did not translate into significant awards or widespread commercial success during his lifetime."},{"instruction":"Nancy, the librarian, is shelving books from the cart. She shelved 12 history books, 8 romance books, and 4 poetry books from the top section of the cart. Half the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, which she quickly put back into place. Then, she shelved the remaining books from the bottom of the cart, including 5 Western novels and 6 biographies. How many books did she have on the book cart when she started? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Step 1: Calculate the number of books from the top section of the cart. Nancy shelved 12 history books, 8 romance books, and 4 poetry books from the top section of the cart. Therefore, the total number of books from the top section is: Top section books = 12 history books + 8 romance books + 4 poetry books Top section books = 24 books Step 2: Calculate the number of non-mystery books from the bottom section of the cart. Nancy shelved 5 Western novels and 6 biographies from the bottom section of the cart. Therefore, the total number of non-mystery books from the bottom section is: Non-mystery books (bottom section) = 5 Western novels + 6 biographies Non-mystery books (bottom section) = 11 books Step 3: Calculate the number of mystery books in the bottom section of the cart. We know that half the books in the bottom section were mystery books. Thus, non-mystery books in the bottom section are also half the books in the bottom section. So the number of mystery books equals the number of non-mystery books in the bottom section: Mystery books (bottom section) = 11 books Step 4: Calculate the total number of books in the bottom section of the cart. Total number of books in the bottom section is the sum of mystery books and non-mystery books: Bottom section books = 11 mystery books + 11 non-mystery books Bottom section books = 22 books Step 5: Calculate the total number of books on the book cart when Nancy started. The total number of books on the book cart is the sum of the books from the top section and the bottom section: Total books on the cart = 24 top section books + 22 bottom section books Total books on the cart = 46 books So, Nancy had 46 books on the book cart when she started."},{"instruction":"Choose from options, is the following sentence linguistically acceptable?

About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed. A very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future. A small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science. Twenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening. The training performance of each runner was carefully measured at the beginning and end of each 3-week treatment period. The runners stuck to a set training schedule which allowed a more accurate assessment of any changes in performance over the training period. Why was a set training schedule used in a study of training performance of runners? - not enough information - the runners had a regimen to begin with - it was easier to study - it allowed for a more accurate assessment of any changes The answer is:","output":"A set training schedule was used in the study of training performance of runners because it allowed for a more accurate assessment of any changes in performance over the training period. By having a consistent and standardized training regimen for each participant, the researchers were able to better control the study variables and systematically evaluate the impact of the different dietary interventions on performance. Using a set training schedule ensured that all the runners followed the same exercise routine, allowing the researchers to eliminate potential variations in the intensity or frequency of training sessions that might have otherwise influenced the results. This uniformity in the training schedule enabled a more reliable comparison of each runner's performance data and facilitated a clearer understanding of the relationship between the antioxidants and potential exercise adaptation. Furthermore, by implementing a fixed training schedule, the study was able to more effectively measure the impact of the dietary interventions on the runners' performance. As every participant adhered to the same exercise regimen, the researchers could confidently attribute any changes in performance to the specific intervention under investigation, rather than differences in the training schedule itself. In summary, a set training schedule was used in the study of training performance of runners because it provided a controlled environment that allowed for a more accurate assessment of the potential changes in performance. This approach minimized the influence of extraneous variables and enhanced the reliability of the findings, ultimately allowing researchers to better understand the effects of antioxidant supplementation on the training adaptations of well-trained female runners."},{"instruction":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Choose your instrument: First, pick the instrument you want to play. In jazz, people often play the saxophone, trumpet, piano, guitar, bass, or drums. Decide which one you like the most. 2. Start learning the basics: Once you choose your instrument, start learning the basic notes, rhythms, and techniques. You can learn from a teacher, watch videos or read beginner's books. 3. Listen to jazz music: Listen to lots of jazz songs and styles to understand how this music sounds and feels. Jazz can be playful, smooth, or energetic. Pay attention to how the musicians play their instruments, experiment with their sound and create a conversation with each other. 4. Learn jazz scales: Jazz musicians use special scales, called \\"modes,\\" to make their melodies and solos. Some popular ones are the major scale, the minor scale, and the blues scale. Practice playing these scales on your instrument. 5. Learn chords: In jazz, a group of notes played together is called a \\"chord.\\" When musicians play together, they often use chords to create a rich and deep sound. Practice playing simple chords and progressions on your instrument. 6. Practice improvisation: Jazz is all about creating music in the moment. Improvisation means making up melodies and solos on the spot while playing. Start small, and as you get more confident, you can try more complex improvisations. 7. Play with others: Jazz is a social music, so find friends or join a group to play with. This will help you learn how to listen to others, take turns, and make beautiful music together. 8. Keep practicing: The more you practice, the better you will get at playing jazz. Consistency and patience will help you master your instrument and enjoy the creative world of jazz music."},{"instruction":"Where are people likely to push a religious tract? Options: - public place - airport - church's track rack - laundromat - stage Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"1. Public place: People are likely to push a religious tract in a public place because it can be an effective way to reach a diverse and large audience. Public places generally have more foot traffic, making it easier to distribute the materials to a wider range of people who may be interested or curious about the religious content. 2. Airport: An airport is also a good location to distribute religious tracts because it brings together a diverse cross-section of society, including people who may be traveling to or from religious events, pilgrimages, or even those who are in search of spiritual guidance. Also, the waiting times in airports can provide enough downtime for people to read the tract. 3. Church's tract rack: A church's tract rack is likely the most focused and appropriate place to push a religious tract. Many churches have special racks or tables designed for the distribution of religious literature. Visitors attending church services or events are more likely to be interested or open to the religious content since they share similar beliefs or are exploring the faith. 4. Laundromat: Laundromats are a less likely place to push a religious tract because people typically visit these facilities for a specific purpose unrelated to religion. However, it is still a common gathering area, and people may have downtime while waiting for their laundry, which provides an opportunity for them to pick up and read the tract. 5. Stage: A stage is typically not an ideal place to distribute religious tracts as the focus at events is usually on the performance or presentation. Unless the stage is being used for a religious event specifically, it would not be an appropriate venue for distributing religious materials. In conclusion, based on the options given, the church's tract rack seems to be the most optimal and focused place to push religious tracts, followed by public places and airports. Laundromats can also be a place to distribute the tracts but might not be as effective as the other options mentioned. A stage is generally not a suitable location unless it is being used for a religious event."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, we have Spanish and Catalan tweets for automatic stance detection.

She ran the dishwasher instead of the washing machine because the Options: (1). washing machine was the appliance that was working.; (2). dishwasher was the appliance that was working.;","output":"(2). dishwasher was the appliance that was working. The old washing machine had broken down again, a common occurrence in their humble abode. She had asked her husband to fix it multiple times, but the repairs seemed to only work for a few moments before it groaned back into disrepair. She didn't blame him, though. He was usually a good handyman, but this washing machine seemed to be cursed. No matter how many times he brought it back to life, it refused to stay that way. Weariness settled into her bones as she stared down at the towering pile of dirty laundry. It taunted her, a constant reminder of the endless tasks that made up her daily routine. She knew that if she didn't wash the clothes soon, the pile would only grow higher and more menacing with each passing day. It was then that a sudden thought crossed her mind, a glimmer of resourcefulness that broke through her despair. She wondered if the dishwasher could double as a makeshift washing machine. She knew the idea seemed ludicrous. Dishwashers were, after all, meant for washing dishes. But what was a washing machine other than a container meant to swish clothes around in soapy water? She figured that as long as she made some adjustments, perhaps the dishwasher could be a temporary solution to her laundry crisis. Carefully, she began sorting through the pile. She realized that delicate fabrics and certain colors couldn't be washed in the dishwasher; the rough water flow would be too strong for them. The water temperature would also be a factor, so she resorted to the load of clothes that could handle the hot water that the dishwasher usually provided. As she put the clothes in the dishwasher, she felt a sense of excitement at her ingenuity. She was determined to make the best of her situation. After all, her grandmother used to tell her stories about washing clothes in the river, so how bad could this be in comparison? She grabbed the laundry detergent and paused, realizing that the dishwasher would need less soap than a washing machine. With a shake of her head and a wry smile, she poured a small amount of detergent into the designated dishwasher compartment. Then, holding her breath, she pressed the start button. The dishwasher roared to life, its insides whirring and splashing as it moved through the wash cycle. As she waited, she couldn't help but feel a mix of apprehension and hope. Would the clothes emerge clean and fresh, a testament to her clever actions? Or would they be ruined, leaving her to deal with an even more significant disaster than before? Finally, the dishwasher came to a halt, releasing a puff of steam as the door swung open. Nervous, she reached in, pulling out an item of clothing. To her surprise, it was not as terrible as she had feared. The clothes were wet, of course, but otherwise seemed clean and relatively unblemished. Relief washed over her, and she felt a sense of pride. She had managed to overcome a challenge with limited resources, and in the process, had learned something new about her own resourcefulness. With renewed energy, she proceeded to remove the remaining clothes, hanging them around the house to dry. There was a certain sense of satisfaction in seeing the damp clothes hanging on every available surface, their bright colors breathing life into the room. Despite having only wanted a washing machine, she felt fulfilled by her dishwasher-turned-laundry machine. As she returned to her daily routine, she couldn't help but smile. Sometimes, life threw obstacles into her path, and often, they seemed impossible to overcome. But as she'd discovered, in the face of adversity, she could find a way to adapt and grow, even when both options seemed imperfect. And in doing so, she not only conquered the laundry crisis but stumbled upon a newfound sense of innovation and strength within herself."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)?

In this case, we have a well-known thespian tackling Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\", so that the film's last third delves effectively into the thriller genre  with press agent Edmond O'Brien (who happens to really be besotted with Colman's co-star and ex-wife Signe Hasso) 'investigating' the actor's possible involvement in the Desdemona-like strangling of a celebrity-seeking waitress (a very slim Shelley Winters). The theatrical/New York atmosphere of the immediate post-war era is vividly captured by the husband-and-wife screen writing team of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon and legendary \\"actor's director\\" George Cukor (all of whom were recognized by the Academy with nominations); incidentally, the film nabbed a second Oscar for Miklos Rozsa's eclectic score.

Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant.

Over time, he gained significant experience and knowledge in the retail sector, propelling him to success as he built upon existing family businesses.

Step 2: Give a brief introduction \\"Inception\\" is a 2010 science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Tom Hardy. The movie is a fascinating exploration of dreams and the subconscious mind, as a skilled thief named Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) uses technology to enter people's dreams and steal valuable information. Step 3: Discuss the plot without spoiling major events The plot of \\"Inception\\" follows Dom Cobb and his team of specialists as they attempt a seemingly impossible task – not to steal an idea from someone's mind, but to plant one instead. This process, called inception, becomes the main focus of the movie, as Cobb takes on a job that promises to help him clear his criminal record and reunite him with his family. The story is filled with twists, emotional depth, and tense action sequences as the team navigates multiple layers of dreams, each becoming more unstable than the previous one. Step 4: Discuss the acting, directing, and technical aspects The acting in \\"Inception\\" is superb, with DiCaprio giving a captivating performance as Cobb, portraying the character's emotional turmoil and obsession with his work. The supporting cast, including Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, also deliver strong performances, bringing depth and complexity to their characters.

However, based on this brief statement, I can offer an analysis of possible ratings that can be inferred from these two words. 1. ★★★★★ (5 stars) - If the user meant that the download process was seamless, quick, and efficient, and that they are overall satisfied with the product or service, then this could be possibly interpreted as a 5-star rating, reflecting a positive experience. 2. ★★★★ (4 stars) - This rating would represent a very good experience, where the user found the download process satisfactory but may have a few suggestions for improvements or encountered minor issues during the process. 3. ★★★ (3 stars) - This rating would indicate an average experience with the download process, where the user did not encounter any major problems, but also did not find it to be outstanding or highly efficient. 4. ★★ (2 stars) - If the user experienced issues during the download process, such as slow speeds or interruptions, but managed to complete the download successfully in the end, a 2-star rating could be inferred from the review. 5. ★ (1 star) - It is unlikely that the review \\"Download Approved\\" would represent a 1-star rating, as this usually signifies a very negative experience. Since the download was approved, it is assumed some level of success or satisfaction was achieved. From the limited information provided in this review, it is not possible to accurately determine the exact star rating the user intended. However, considering the positive sentiment of the statement and the approval of the download, I would be inclined to assume a higher star rating, such as 4 or 5 stars.

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties.

The critical apparatus presents the author's work in three parts: first, a list or description of the evidence that the editor used (names of manuscripts, or abbreviations called sigla); second, the editor's analysis of that evidence (sometimes a simple likelihood rating),[citation needed]; and third, a record of rejected variants of the text (often in order of preference).[citation needed] Q: What is included in or accompanies in \\"critical edition\\"?","output":"A critical edition is a scholarly publication that aims to present as close an approximation to the original or authorial text as possible. It is the result of a thorough textual criticism process, which involves assessing and comparing various manuscripts, earlier editions, translations, and other sources to identify and correct any errors or discrepancies. A critical edition is accompanied by an apparatus criticus, or critical apparatus, which serves as a documentation and justification of the editorial choices made in the process of establishing the text. The critical apparatus consists of three main components, providing a comprehensive account of the textual critic's work: 1. A list or description of the evidence used: This comprises the various sources consulted during the textual criticism process, such as manuscripts, early printed editions, and translations. The evidence is usually represented by sigla, which are abbreviations or symbols that identify specific manuscripts or editions. This list helps the reader trace the origins of the text presented in the critical edition and understand its historical context. 2. The editor's analysis of the evidence: This part of the critical apparatus may include an explanation of the methodology employed in assessing the evidence, the rationale behind selecting particular readings, and the reason for rejecting others. In some cases, the editor may provide a likelihood rating to indicate the level of certainty they have in their choice of readings. This enables readers to appreciate the editor's thought process and decision-making criteria in constructing the critical edition. 3. A record of rejected variants of the text: In this section, the editor documents the alternate readings or textual variants that were considered but ultimately not included in the critical edition. The variants are typically listed in order of preference, with the most likely alternative presented first. This record allows readers to compare the chosen text with the rejected variants, offering insight into the editor's choices and promoting further scholarly discussion and analysis. Together, these components of the critical apparatus provide essential context and transparency for the critical edition, ensuring that both the editor's work and the resulting text are open to scrutiny, evaluation, and ongoing scholarly debate. This contributes to the dynamic nature of textual criticism, as future discoveries and insights may lead to revisions and new critical editions of the same text."},{"instruction":"Is the following sentence factually correct? \\"Odysseus rode his bike to the pancake shop to try and fix his Pokemon game.\\" Options: - yes - no Chain of thought and solution for this question is:","output":"No, the given sentence is not factually correct. Chain of thought and solution for this question: 1. Odysseus: Odysseus is a legendary Greek hero from the epic poem, \\"The Odyssey,\\" which was written by the ancient Greek poet Homer. He was a king of Ithaca and a warrior who played a major role in the Trojan War. He is a mythological figure and wasn't known to ride bikes. 2. Bike: Bicycles were invented much later in history, during the 19th century, which makes the idea of Odysseus riding one anachronistic. 3. Pancake shop: Pancakes, though they have existed in various forms in ancient times, were not known to be associated specifically with Odysseus or ancient Greek culture directly. 4. Pokemon game: Pokemon, a popular fictional universe featuring various creatures, was created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori in 1995 as a video game and later expanded into other media forms such as card games, TV shows, and movies. This is a modern invention and has no relation to Odysseus or ancient Greek culture.

After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed.

The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s.

He liked to take photographs, so a family friend bought the young Jackson a super 8mm camera. He has been a filmmaker even since. At age nine he even attempted to remake his favorite film, King Kong, using his own stop-motion effect. Unlike many of the filmmakers working today, Jackson never went to film school. Instead he created his own short films with the help of family and friends.

With that avenue closed, Jackson began working other jobs to support himself, while shooting shorts on the weekend. One of these weekend films, expanded from its original ten minutes length into a feature film. The project took four years to complete (1983-1987)and was called Bad Taste.

Today, Parature’s Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product suite supports millions of end users worldwide. With the advent of social media channels, customer service has forever changed. Consumers are no longer willing to sit and listen to classical music on hold. In today’s age of hyper-responsiveness, customers expect instant responses from support reps on very public online platforms. Instead of shying away from social media, smart businesses will leverage their social channels to spread a positive brand reputation, to connect happy customers and to step up their customer support efforts. Consumers aren’t eager to blast negative messages about your company – unless your brand is unresponsive. I recently learned at an IBM conference that customers are five times more likely to post something positive than negative, and that companies usually have at least 10 warnings before someone posts a negative comment. Happy customers who get their issues resolved tell an average of four to six people about their positive experiences, according to the White House Office of Consumer Affairs. It pays to treat your customers well, not only for the repeat business, but also to gain the positive word-of-mouth consumers now broadcast across social media. Satisfied customers can become your most influential brand ambassadors. They’ll help to answer customer service questions posted online and also tout their own positive experiences with your business. Here are the five best ways to turn customers into brand ambassadors through customer service. When a customer turns to social media for a support issue, he expects a brand to generate the fastest response possible. According to a recent UK study, 25% of social media users expect a response within one hour, and 6% expect a response within 10 minutes. If you allow a support issue to dangle for too long, you risk being perceived as a company that either doesn’t know the answer or doesn’t care enough to reply promptly. Remember, most people on social networks aren’t itching to post negative comments. They only do so after a bad experience. Therefore, don’t give them enough time to have a bad experience. Private and direct messaging on Facebook and Twitter is all well and good, but when it comes to customer service, it’s best to be totally transparent and visible. The answer you give to one customer could, in turn, help thousands more. Think of each post and interaction as a resource that future customers can reference. Not to mention, customers will be more apt to direct friends to your page with their own questions. Social media sites foster an online community around your brand. Watch how customers discuss and respond to your products so you can join the conversation and better understand the community that supports your brand. It’s vital that you ensure all customer support answers remain consistent across the web and across all social channels. If a common question is posted on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, then each response should communicate the same solution. Conflicting answers create confused, unhappy customers. Just as people expect consistent experiences with your products, they also expect consistent service across all of your channels. Brand accuracy drives confidence and credibility, and helps build brand loyalty among your customers. If consistency creates brand ambassadors, then being organized is equally paramount. Admittedly, the cross-company integration and management of social media continues to be challenging. Maintaining a successful social media presence on just one network is a full-time job. Trying to do it over multiple networks is impossible if your support staff isn’t properly organized. Customers can spot disorganization a mile away, especially online. However, if you demonstrate that your company support knows what it’s doing, you’ll earn the respect and trust of brand loyalists. Organization goes beyond knowing who does what on the support team; it’s also vital that everyone on the team is on the same page. Each team member must know where to seek reliable answers, and each must source information from the same place. As cool as Siri is, she still hasn’t crossed from digital assistant to human entity. Until then, your social media customer support should remain as human as possible. On the bright side, social networks already take the formalities out of conversation. It’s one of their biggest draws. Therefore, a customer’s name isn’t “Inquiry #83kd4z.” She’s Christie from Denver. People respond best when they feel like they’re talking to other people. Your customer support should make customers feel as if they’re posting a normal question on a friend’s wall. Creating that kind of relationship with your customer should be the priority of any company. Using customer service to create brand ambassadors isn’t the Herculean task it once was. Social media is presenting countless opportunities to turn your company’s support system into an open, interactive community, where customers can share their positive experiences with one another and spread the good word about your products and services – all on your behalf.

All of a sudden, this is the worst disaster for the Secret Service, ever. All of a sudden, the Secret Service is out of control. All of a sudden, anything might have happened, like one of the 11 agents could have been blackmailed to open a door for a sniper or to look the other way as a bomb-carrying terrorist walks up to the president. All of a sudden, the men and women of the Secret Service are no longer the best and the brightest. Especially the men. All of a sudden... Stop! It's time for a reality check. The 11 agents who were sent home from Colombia in disgrace before the president even left Washington were there in a support role. Whether they were manning metal detectors or handling dogs that sweep rooms, whether they were part of a sniper team or standing post at 3 a.m. along a barricaded street, they were not members of the Presidential Protective Division (PPD). They were not on the president's shoulder. At no time was the president's security in danger. What damage did their stupidity do? Obviously, a lot to their personal lives, their marriages and their careers. Obviously, also, a lot to the image and reputation of the Secret Service. The legislation creating the Secret Service was sitting on Abraham Lincoln's desk, waiting to be signed, on April 15, 1865, the night he was assassinated. In those days, the Secret Service was housed inside the Treasury Department, and its job was to protect and defend the currency and monetary instruments of the United States. It didn't get the supplementary duty of protecting the president and vice president until after William McKinley was assassinated in 1901. No agent I have ever met was hired for his sense of humor. These are very serious men and women who do their jobs very seriously. They have always been the best and the brightest. And they still are. You can see it in the way they stand a little taller and walk with a different gait than others in law enforcement. You can see it in their pride. Frankly, I can't think of any other law enforcement agency where pride counts as much as it does with the Secret Service. It's the same pride that is always so visible with the U.S. Marines. That's the reason why this scandal matters. Not because someone thinks the agency is out of control. It's not. Not because of wildly exaggerated threats of blackmail. No, Chicken Little, the sky is not falling. It matters because the idiotic actions of 11 agents who forgot who they are and what their badge stands for deeply affects every active duty agent and tens of thousands of retired agents. Pride has been dented. And agents are, rightly, furious. These are men and women who have made -- and continue to make -- huge personal sacrifices for their share in that pride. The divorce rate among agents is high. That's not because they party with hookers, but because for the privilege of wearing that special five starred badge, they abandon any thoughts of their time being their own. They miss birthdays and Christmas, Little League games, graduations, school plays, first teeth, first steps, first words. When the president travels, especially overseas, it's a flying circus with 800-1,000 people, limousines, helicopters, communications equipment, big guns, small guns, sometimes food, and often 20-30 planes. As an integral part of this, Secret Service agents have two main concerns: To create and to maintain a tightly controlled environment in which the president can do his job safely and to bring everyone home at night. Anything short of that is, the way the Secret Service defines the word, failure. Just as those two things are true, so are these: What happened with those 11 agents is defined as stupidity. They will be dealt with quickly by the Secret Service. The president's opponents will pretend that there are political ramifications and invent whatever capital out of this that they can to embarrass the president. It will take a long time before pride is fully restored, and, if this ever happens again, it will definitely not be soon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Robinson.","output":"Title: The Effect of the Secret Service Scandal on Agency Pride 1. The Secret Service faced scrutiny after 11 agents engaged in a scandal involving alcohol and prostitution while away from home, casting doubt on the agency's culture and putting its image at risk. 2. Despite the negative attention and potential risks, such as blackmail or compromised security, the president's safety was never in danger, as these agents were not part of the Presidential Protective Division (PPD). 3. The Secret Service, created in 1865, has a history of pride and dedication comparable to that of the U.S. Marines, which is why the scandal is so damaging - it dents the pride of active and retired agents. 4. Agents sacrifice much to serve, with high divorce rates and missed family milestones - this pride is essential to their motivation and dedication. 5. The scandal highlighted the need for maintaining a tightly controlled environment around the president and will likely speed up the process of dealing with such situations in the future. 6. It will take time to restore the pride of the Secret Service due to this incident, but agents remain committed to their duty, striving for excellence and avoiding future scandals."},{"instruction":"Please add spaces between words: WhenyouhaveearnedthetierpointsneededtomoveuptotheFinnairPlusLifetimePlatinumtier,we’llsendyouyournewLifetimemembershipcardbypostwithinafewweeks.","output":"To add spaces between words in the given text, I'll follow these steps: 1.

For example, if you are a talented baker and enjoy putting together new and interesting recipes, a bakery is a good choice. Focus on your talents and interests. If you don’t already have aspirations about what kind of shop you want to own, you can take a more practical approach to figuring out what your city or town is missing. Walk or drive around your city. Bring a pen and paper with you to write down the businesses you see. Make a tally mark next to each business as you come across more than one. For example, if you see 5 bakeries, you should have the word “bakery” written with 4 tally marks next to it. Although not the most scientific, it can give you a good idea of what kind of shops are in each area. Visit your local chamber of commerce. Typically, chambers of commerce offer a wealth of information about what businesses are already existent, and lots of additional information for small business owners. They may be able to advise you on potentially good business ventures. Governmental agencies typically offer plenty of information about economic indicators, income and earnings in different parts of the country, as well as statistics about employment. This information can also point you in the direction of good business ideas. Visit trade shows and read business magazines.

This combination technique consists of camera traps and sufficient tiger search to collect basic data .","output":"These two sentences convey similar meanings, but there are subtle differences in their structure and word choices. Let's break them down for a better understanding: 1. \\"They measure not only population numbers, but also demographic parameters. This combination technique consists of camera traps and sufficient tiger search to collect base data.\\" 2. \\"They not only measure population numbers, but also measure demographic parameters. This combination technique consists of camera traps and sufficient tiger search to collect basic data.\\" Both sentences begin by illustrating that 'they' are responsible for measuring population numbers and demographic parameters. However, the first sentence presents this information in a more concise manner by using 'measure' only once. In contrast, the second sentence repeats the verb 'measure', making it less concise in comparison. Another difference between the two sentences lies in the terms 'base data' and 'basic data'. 'Base data' typically implies fundamental, foundational information—the groundwork upon which further analysis and conclusions can be built. On the other hand, 'basic data' may refer to simple or essential data, but this term lacks the sense of it being a foundation for further work. As for the remaining content in both sentences, everything else stays virtually the same. Both sentences mention a combination technique, which consists of camera traps and sufficient tiger search to collect the aforementioned data. In conclusion, although the sentences share very similar meanings, they differ in the structure (specifically, how the verbs are applied) and the choice of words used to describe the data being collected. While both sentences work well for expressing the same general idea, the first sentence is slightly more concise, and it emphasizes that the data collected serves as a foundation for further work."},{"instruction":"Dorries was born as Nadine Vanessa Bargery in Liverpool. Her father was a bus driver who became a lift operator having suffered from Raynaud's disease, which had necessitated the amputation of his toes. Her father was a Roman Catholic of Irish descent, while her mother was an English Protestant. Dorries was raised as a Protestant. In 2009, she gave this account of her 2005 selection: \\"Three weeks before the 2005 general election I, a council estate Scouser, was selected as the Conservative candidate to represent a southern rural constituency. Because the vacancy occurred so quickly and so close to D-day, the party provided my association with a shortlist of seventeen candidates, of which about five were women. Following a long day of interviews in hot sunny rooms, the list was whittled down to a shortlist of three ... I was informed that I had been selected outright on the first ballot ... That pride, that sense of achievement, the knowledge that I was selected on the basis of my performance and merit above all other candidates on that day is what enables me to hold my head up high in this place.\\" Dorries's account of her own selection appears to contradict a news report which The Times ran at the time, reporting that Conservative Campaign Headquarters placed a majority of women on the shortlist and pressed for the selection of a female candidate: \\"Mrs Dorries, who has three teenage children, easily beat her 11 rivals and won the plum safe seat on the first ballot at the selection this weekend. Party officials were thrilled that the seat has gone to a woman. Previously, only two women had been selected in the 17 safe seats where sitting MPs have retired. Senior party figures had made clear to local dignitaries that they would like the seat to go to a woman and presented the constituency with a shortlist of seven women and five men to underline the point.\\" In a debate on Woman's Hour, broadcast on 22 August 2001, Dorries (as Nadine Bargery) had advocated all-women shortlists if the behaviour of Conservative selection committees did not change. In 2009 though, Dorries was highly critical of David Cameron's proposal to consider using all-women shortlists, arguing against a move which would create \\"two classes of MPs\\". She wrote that \\"Sometimes I feel sorry for some of the Labour women who were selected via all-women shortlists. Everyone knows who they are. They are constantly derided.\\" Dorries was elected to the House of Commons at the 2005 general election for the safe seat of Mid-Bedfordshire on the retirement through ill health after a series of scandals of Jonathan Sayeed, with a majority of 11,355, and made her maiden speech on 25 May 2005. She was re-elected in 2010, with an increased majority and a swing of 2.3% from the Lib Dems. Dorries, described as \\"a right-wing, working-class Conservative\\", is a member of the socially conservative Cornerstone Group. A Christian, she has said in an interview for a Salvation Army newspaper: \\"I am not an MP for any reason other than because God wants me to be. There is nothing I did that got me here; it is what God did. There is nothing amazing or special about me, I am just a conduit for God to use.\\" Dorries initially supported the attempt of David Davis to become Conservative leader in 2005 but later withdrew her endorsement. David Cameron, the successful candidate, though \\"represent[s] everything that through my life . . . [I have] been suspicious of.\\" In May 2007, she criticised Cameron for ignoring the recommendations of the Conservative public policy working group in favour of grammar schools. However, she did defend the selection of Elizabeth Truss in 2009, whose Conservative candidature was called into question after an extra-marital affair was revealed. Dorries served as a member of the Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee. In the year to November 2008, she attended only 2% of sessions. The committee then reformed as the Science and Technology Select Committee; she did not attend a single session. In 2010, she was elected to the Health Select Committee. Dorries has said she witnessed \\"botched\\" abortions on two occasions, an experience that influenced her campaign to lower the point during a pregnancy at which an abortion can be performed. On 31 October 2006, Dorries introduced a Private Member's Bill in the House of Commons, which would have reduced the time limit for abortion in Great Britain from 24 to 21 weeks; introduced a ten-day 'cooling-off' period for women wishing to have an abortion, during which time the woman would be required to undergo counselling; and accelerate access to abortion at the end of the cooling-off period. Dorries alleged she had received death threats from pro-choice activists and was given police protection. Parliament voted by 187 to 108 to reject the bill. In May 2008, Dorries tabled an amendment to the proposed Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill seeking to reduce the upper limit for abortions to 20 weeks from the current 24 weeks of pregnancy. Reportedly written by Andrea Williams then of The Lawyers' Christian Fellowship, Dorries has denied that her campaigning on the abortion issue receives funding from Christian fundamentalist groups, although Dorries website for the \\"20 Reasons for 20 Weeks\\" campaign in 2008 was registered by Christian Concern For Our Nation (CCFON), another organisation with which Williams is involved; one of the pressure group's interns set up the website without charge to Dorries. According to Guardian journalist Kira Cochrane it was the greatest challenge to women's abortion rights in nearly 20 years. Dorries' amendment was defeated by 332 votes to 190, with a separate 22-week limit opposed by 304 votes to 233. A majority of MPs continued to support the 24-week limit. She said of her tactics on this issue in 2007: \\"If I were to argue that all abortions should be banned, the ethical discussions would go round in circles ... My view is that the only way forward is to argue for a reduction in the time limit ... it's every baby's right to have a life.\\" What was the experience?","output":"Nadine Dorries is a woman from Liverpool who became a Member of Parliament (MP), which means she helps make laws and decisions for the country.

She believes in some ideas that are more traditional, like being against abortion, which is when a pregnancy is ended on purpose. Nadine wanted to reduce the time limit for abortion and make sure women have enough time to think carefully before having one.

Think about people you know in real life who remind you of the character or who inspired the character. You can also play on an existing name you feel fits with the character and change the spelling. For example, Kris instead of Chris, or Tara instead of Tanya. Look for names that fit with your character's background and don't seem odd in terms of your character's role or position. A soccer mom who lives in suburban Portland and identifies as Caucasian is likely not going to be named Esmeralda. And an evil sorcerer from another planet will likely not be named Joe or Craig. There are several character name generators online that you can also use, filtering by background and gender. If your character was to fill out a census or a form at a doctor's office, what would they specify for gender, age, height, and weight? Though you may not use this character information in your story or novel, your character's gender, and age will affect their character voice and their point of view. For example, the young child character, Scout, in Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird will view the world of the novel differently than her father, Atticus Finch, an older man. It's important to specify your character's physical characteristics, especially their hair and eye color. Often, description of characters focuses on hair color or eye color, and these details can help signal to your reader that your character has a certain ethnic background or appearance. These descriptions can also indicate a certain type of character. For example, describing your character's physical appearance as: “She had dishwater blonde hair and gray eyes that glazed over when she was bored” not only gives your reader a clear physical description, it also shows the character's personality. Harry Potter's lightning bolt scar is a good example of a distinguishing marker that identifies his character and makes him unique. You can also use birthmarks, like a mole on your character's face, or a marker due to an accident, like a burn mark or a scar due to stitches. These scars or markers can make your character feel distinct to your reader. They can also tell the reader more about your character. In To Kill a Mockingbird, Scout's brother Jem is characterized on the first page of the novel through a description of his broken arm: “When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn't have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt.” Harper Lee uses the injury, or physical marker, to introduce Jem's character and tell the reader that he has a shorter left arm, a distinguishing characteristic that makes him a more nuanced and believable character. Clothing can be a great way to show the reader more of your character's personality and preferences. A character who wears punk t-shirts, black jeans, and Doc Martens will come across as a rebellious character, while a character who wears a sweater set and loafers may come across as a more conservative character. Be specific when you are describing a character's clothing, but don't repeat descriptions too much in the narrative. Establishing your character's style of dress once will create a clear picture in the reader's mind that they can refer back to. In Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep, the main character Philip Marlowe describes his clothing in two concise sentences: “I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn't care who knew it.” Chandler uses very specific detail to paint a clear image of Marlowe and he injects the description with Marlowe's voice, “I didn't care who knew it,” adding more depth to the description. Your character's station in life will affect how she navigates certain situations and how she will react to everyday occurrences. A young African American man living in Washington, D.C. will have a different experience or perspective than a young Southern man living in Little Rock, Arkansas. And a middle class woman living in New York will have different daily experience than a woman living on food stamps in New York. Your character's background and class experience will be an integral part of their perspective as a character. Though it is not essential that you announce your character's background and class to the reader, your character will feel more realistic and true if their station in life factors into their point of view. The characters in the fiction of Junot Diaz, for example, uses colloquial terms that indicate class and background to the reader. In Diaz's short story “The Cheater's Guide to Love” he notes: “Maybe if you'd been engaged to a super-open-minded blanquita you could have survived it—but you're not engaged to a super-open-minded blanquita. Your girl is a bad-ass salcedense who doesn't believe in open anything; in fact, the one thing she warned you about, that she swore she would never forgive, was cheating.” In this story, Diaz uses Spanish terms to indicate the character/narrator's background, without having to tell the reader directly that the narrator is Spanish. Another way to make your character more believable on the page is to delve into the details of their profession or career. If you are writing a character who works as an architect, this character should know about how to design a building and may see a city skyline in a unique way. Or if you are writing a character who works as a private detective, this character should know basic P.I. protocol and how to solve a case. Use library books and online sources to make your character's career convincing in your story. If possible, try to speak to someone who is in the profession you would like to use for your character. Interview them about their daily habits at work to make sure you are getting the details of their profession right. Summary:","output":"To create a believable character, think about their name, appearance, and background. You can use real-life inspiration or change the spelling of existing names. Describe your character's physical features, like hair and eye color, and include any unique marks or scars. Clothing can also show personality, so describe their style of dress. Consider your character's background and class, and how it affects their perspective. Learn about their profession to include accurate details in your story, and talk to people in that profession if possible. These elements will help make your character more realistic and interesting."},{"instruction":"What is a question about this article? If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

What did Sadat exchange for the remainder of Sinai?","output":"Anwar Sadat exchanged peace with Israel for the remainder of the Sinai Peninsula."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Drunken driving--sometimes called America's socially accepted form of murder--has become a national epidemic . Every hour of every day about three Americans on average are killed by drunken drivers, adding up to an incredible 250,000 over the past ten years. A drunken driver is usually defined as one with a 0.10 blood alcohol content or roughly three beers, glasses of wine or several glasses of whisky drunk within two hours. Heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the American manly image and judges were serious in most courts, but the drunken slaughter has recently caused so many well-publicized tragedies, especially involving young children, that public opinion is no longer so tolerant. Twenty states have raised the legal drinking age to 21, reversing a trend in the 1960s to reduce it to 18. After New Jersey lowered it to 18, the number of people killed by 18-20-year-old drivers more than doubled, so the state recently upped it back to 21. Reformers, however, fear raising the drinking age will have little effect unless accompanied by educational programs to help young people to develop \\"responsible attitudes\\" about drinking and teach them to resist peer pressure to drink. Though new laws have led to increased arrests and tests and, in many areas already, to a marked decline in accidents, some states are also punishing bars for serving customers too many drinks. A bar in Massachusetts was fined for serving six or more double brandies to a customer who \\"obviously drunk\\" and later drove off the road, killing a nine-year-old boy. As the accidents continue to occur daily in every state, some Americans are even beginning to speak well of the 13 years of national prohibition of alcohol that began in 1919, what President Hoover called the \\"noble experiment\\". They forgot that legal prohibition didn't stop drinking, but encouraged political corruption and organized crime. As with the booming drug trade generally, there is no easy solution. Question: In America, public opinion about drunken driving has changed because _ . Options: A: judges are no longer serious B: new laws are introduced in some states C: the problem has attracted public attention D: drivers do not appreciate their manly image A:","output":"Step 1: Understand the context of the question and identify the key points from the article. The article discusses the issue of drunken driving in America and how public opinion has changed over time, particularly due to well-publicized tragedies involving young children. Step 2: Analyze each option and find the one that matches with the key points identified from the article. Option A: \\"judges are no longer serious\\" - The article states that judges used to be more lenient because heavy drinking was associated with a \\"manly image,\\" but it doesn't say that judges being lenient causes the public opinion change. Option B: \\"new laws are introduced in some states\\" - Although the introduction of new laws is a consequence of the changing public opinion, it is not the cause of the change itself. Option C: \\"the problem has attracted public attention\\" - The article highlights how well-publicized tragedies, especially those involving young children, have led to a shift in public opinion, which matches with this option. Option D: \\"drivers do not appreciate their manly image\\" - This option contradicts the article, which says that heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the American manly image. Step 3: Choose the answer that best aligns with the information from the article. Based on the analysis of the options, the correct answer is C: the problem has attracted public attention. This is because the well-publicized tragedies mentioned in the article have raised public awareness and led to a shift in public opinion."},{"instruction":"His Excellency: George Washington is a 2004 biography of the first President of the United States, General George Washington. It was written by Joseph Ellis, a professor of History at Mount Holyoke College, who specializes in the founding fathers and the revolutionary and federalist periods. Can we draw the following conclusion? The first President of the United States, George Washington, will be written about for many years to come. Available options: (a). Yes (b). It's impossible to say (c). No","output":"(a). Yes Based on the enduring interest in the founding fathers of the United States, including the first President, George Washington, it is reasonable to conclude that he will continue to be written about for many years to come. This interest can be attributed to several factors that ensure the relevance of Washington's life and legacy in contemporary discussions and historical inquiries. First, as the inaugural President of the United States, George Washington played a crucial role in shaping the country's formative years. His actions and decisions have served as important precedents within the development of the American political system and culture. His symbolic significance as the \\"Father of His Country\\" draws attention to him as a subject of study, and as scholars continue to examine the foundation of the United States, his role in its establishment will keep him in the spotlight. Second, George Washington's military career as the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War has contributed to his ongoing relevance. His strategic leadership and perseverance in the face of adversity demonstrated qualities that many view as emblematic of the American spirit. As a result, historians continually revisit the actions and decisions made by Washington throughout the revolution, seeking insights into how these elements shaped the eventual success of the United States in its fight for independence. Third, Washington's personal life and character continue to generate interest among historians and biographers. His upbringing, relationships, and deeply-held beliefs provide important context to understand the man behind the public figure. The various roles he played throughout his life – as a farmer, military officer, and politician – offer multiple dimensions of study and allow historians to paint a nuanced picture of who he was as a person. Lastly, there is also an interest in George Washington’s public and private struggles on a range of social and moral issues during his period. This provides a fertile ground for historians, scholars, and general readers to debate, gain new perspectives and have a better understanding of his principles. In light of these factors, the conclusion that George Washington will continue to be written about for many years to come seems justified. As a seminal figure in American history, his life and contributions are intrinsically linked with the nation's identity, both past and present. There will always be more to learn, discuss, and interpret regarding Washington's role as a leader, the context of his times, and the impact of his decisions on subsequent generations."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Sapphire Battersea is the 2011 sequel to \\"Hetty Feather\\", written by best selling English author Jacqueline Wilson, whose children's novels frequently feature themes of adoption, divorce and what type of illness?

This statement is largely justified based on the phrase, \\"Power generators, which emit CO2, contribute about 29 percent of the total emissions of all U.S. man-made greenhouse gases.\\" \\"Outsized proportion\\" is a relative term, which means it's larger than the average or expected proportion. In this context, if we consider the numerous anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gas emissions such as transportation, industrial processes, agriculture, residential and commercial activities, waste management, etc., the fact that power generators alone account for 29% presents a significant portion. Thus, labeling this as an 'outsized proportion' seems quite justifiable. However, keep in mind that this 29% is a cumulative statistic that envelops both commercial and non-commercial (e.g., residential and industrial) use of power generators. Commercial applications include power for businesses like data centers, restaurants, office spaces, hospitals among others. Non-commercial applications include residential uses like powering homes and appliances as well as industrial uses like manufacturing processes. To reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in the power sector, various strategies are being employed. These include increasing energy efficiency, transitioning towards clean and renewable sources of energy like wind, solar, and hydro, implementing carbon capture and storage technologies, and electrifying other sectors of the economy, mainly transportation and heating which traditionally rely on burning fossil fuels. However, it's also crucial to bear in mind that while a shift towards cleaner alternatives is necessary, the reliability of power supply must also be ensured. Thus, a balance should be achieved between reducing emissions and maintaining the capacity to meet power demand at all times. In conclusion, power generators indeed seem to contribute an outsized proportion of human-created greenhouse gases in the US, highlighting a need for more sustainable and efficient energy production and usage practices."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"The disability prevalence rates and their distribution according to the characteristics of individuals and provinces in Cuba have patterns similar to those described in other publications.\\" to Spanish.","output":"To translate the given sentence to Spanish, I will break it down into smaller segments, translate each segment, and then combine them coherently. 1.

In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of small particles. In his second reaction, reaction B, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of large chunks of material. Both reactions use the same total weight of sodium oxide. Which reaction, reaction A or reaction B, will occur at a faster rate? Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. A:","output":"Reaction A will occur at a faster rate. Justification: As the hint provided suggests, an increase in surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. This is because there is more area for the reactant to be in contact with the reaction environment, thereby increasing the chance of reactant molecules colliding with one another and forming products. In Reaction A, Demetrious is using sodium oxide in the form of small particles. Due to their small size, these particles have a larger surface area compared to chunks of the same total weight. In Reaction B, Demetrious is using sodium oxide in the form of large chunks. These chunks have less surface area compared to small particles of the same total weight. By this logic, since smaller particles have a higher surface area and can therefore react more quickly than bigger chunks, Reaction A, where sodium oxide is used in the form of small particles, will occur at a faster rate compared to Reaction B."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: How to log in to kidblog<br>Open the confirmation email that was sent to you by your teacher on behalf of kidblog.

This backlash started in late September 2005, when the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published a dozen cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad. The images ranged from serious to comical in nature; a particularly controversial cartoon portrays Mohammad with a bomb wrapped in his turban. The Jutland-based newspaper states that the images were meant to inspire some level of public debate over the image of Islam in Europe, and had no direct aim of offending anyone.","output":"Step 1: Identify the elements in the sentence to verify. - A Middle East newspaper - Published offensive cartoons of Prophet Mohammed - Sparked outrage in 2005 Step 2: Compare the elements with the text. - The text mentions a Danish newspaper named Jyllands-Posten as the publisher of cartoons of Prophet Mohammad. - The cartoons are mentioned to be controversial and provocative, with one example portraying Mohammad with a bomb wrapped in his turban. - The text confirms the backlash started in late September 2005. Step 3: Check if all elements match the text. - The statement mentions a Middle East newspaper, while the text mentions a Danish newspaper.

An unopened bottle of vodka can be stored indefinitely. Because of this, you should wait to open a bottle until you're actually ready to start drinking it. The alcohol in the vodka starts to slowly evaporate once the seal is broken and the bottle is opened. It will take several decades before the opened vodka becomes undrinkable because the alcohol is a preservative. If your vodka is sealed with a cork, make sure the cork is firmly in place since a loose seal could speed up evaporation. If your bottle has a screw top like a cap, make sure it is tightly closed. If the cork or screw top doesn't seem like it will be secure, you may want to store your vodka in a different bottle or container. If you'd like to take vodka with you when you're out and about, store vodka in a flask. Most flasks come with small funnels so you can easily transfer the vodka to the flask. Just be sure to use the vodka or remove it within 3 days since prolonged exposure to the metal in the flask can make your vodka taste metallic. When you've emptied the vodka, rinse out your flask and let it air dry.

Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate..., what would be the answer ?","output":"The answer to the question would be Nielsen.

In contrast, autocrine signaling takes place within the same cell. An autocrine (auto= “self”) is a chemical that elicits a response in the same cell that secreted it. Interleukin-1, or IL-1, is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in inflammatory response. The cells that secrete IL-1 have receptors on their cell surface that bind these molecules, resulting in autocrine signaling. Local intercellular communication is the province of the paracrine, also called a paracrine factor, which is a chemical that induces a response in neighboring cells. Although paracrines may enter the bloodstream, their concentration is generally too low to elicit a response from distant tissues. A familiar example to those with asthma is histamine, a paracrine that is released by immune cells in the bronchial tree.

Tucked away in the bottom left corner of the United States, the San Diego Chargers were easy to either forget or dismiss as the blueprint for NFL ineptitude.","output":"The statement given is a reference to the San Diego Chargers, a former National Football League (NFL) team that was based in San Diego, California. The team was initially established in 1960 as part of the American Football League (AFL) and joined the NFL in 1970 as a result of the AFL-NFL merger. In 2017, the team relocated to Los Angeles and is now known as the Los Angeles Chargers. Being located in the bottom left corner of the United States, San Diego is geographically distant from many other NFL cities, which could have contributed to the Chargers being overlooked or forgotten by some people. Additionally, the team has faced various struggles throughout its history, leading to its occasional dismissal as a model of NFL ineptitude. The San Diego Chargers had their share of ups and downs. While they held a successful track record in the AFL, with one AFL championship in 1963 and five AFL division titles from 1960-1965, their fortune changed in the NFL. The Chargers experienced several dry spells in terms of competitive performance, which contributed to the perception of being an example of NFL inadequacy. One of the primary reasons behind the team's fluctuating success was the constant change in ownership and management. The Chargers dealt with multiple ownership transitions and front office shakeups, which impacted the team's stability and overall direction. This lack of consistency yielded varying results on the field, with the team often going through phases of promise followed by disappointment. Despite the Chargers' struggles, they were able to achieve a certain level of success in the NFL. They qualified for the playoffs on multiple occasions, highlighted by their 1994 season when they reached Super Bowl XXIX. However, they lost to the San Francisco 49ers, which further fueled the notion of the Chargers as a team synonymous with ineptitude. Another contributing factor to this perception could be the lack of a consistently loyal fan base, which is essential for any NFL team's success. San Diego is a city known for its diverse population, advantageous climate, and a strong military presence, which meant that many residents were not originally from the area and may not have felt a strong connection to the Chargers. This situation was further exacerbated by the team's struggles and an aging stadium that needed renovations or replacement. It is worth noting that while the San Diego Chargers often struggled to find consistent success, they produced some of the NFL's all-time greats, such as quarterback Dan Fouts, tight end Antonio Gates, and running back LaDainian Tomlinson. These individuals enjoyed illustrious careers and provided memorable moments for the Chargers fan base. In conclusion, the San Diego Chargers were sometimes seen as the blueprint for NFL ineptitude due to their geographically isolated location, inconsistent on-field performance, fluctuating ownership and management, and divided fan base. That said, it is essential to recognize the moments of success and the legendary players produced by the organization throughout its history."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When faced with a task that requires creativity, many people wonder about the source of unique and innovative ideas. Creativity often seems elusive, as if it's something that can't be captured, yet we witness examples of it every day in various forms of art, writing, and even in everyday problem-solving. There is an underlying element that drives this sort of mental breakthrough, and that is inspiration. Inspiration can come from various sources, such as observing nature, reading books, watching movies, or simply engaging in a conversation with others. What's fascinating about inspiration is that it is not bound by any limitations and can change or evolve over time, just as our experiences and perspectives change throughout our lives. Sometimes, a sudden moment of clarity or a single experience can provide an enormous amount of inspiration. For instance, a musician might attend a concert that features unusual instruments, and the resulting sound may inspire them to create a completely new style of music. Similarly, an artist might visit a museum and absorb different artistic styles that influence their work or witness a sunset that causes them to see the world through a new lens. Learning from the journey and experiences of others can also serve as a source of inspiration. Following the lives and stories of people who have achieved great things or overcome significant obstacles can remind us of our own potential to influence change and strive for greatness. Inspirational figures can be historical icons, famous artists, or simply individuals who have left an impact on our personal lives. Moreover, the act of engaging in creative activities could inspire new ideas and thoughts, which is commonly referred to as “entering the flow.” This state of mind allows for free association and a space for thoughts to interact with each other, sometimes leading to unexpected connections and ideas. For example, a writer might begin with a simple idea for a story, and as they write, their stream of consciousness might take them down new and unanticipated avenues. Finally, challenging oneself and experimenting can also lead to the discovery of inspiration. By stepping out of comfort zones and embracing uncertainty, individuals often ignite their creative spark, leading them to think outside the box and generate innovative concepts. In conclusion, the answer to the question of how one comes up with unique and innovative ideas lies in seeking and embracing inspiration through various means. Inspiration can stem from numerous sources, including nature, art, experiences, observations, conversations, or even challenging oneself. By pursuing inspiration, exploring various creative paths, and harnessing the power of the human mind, individuals are capable of generating brilliant ideas and transforming them into tangible, impactful creations."},{"instruction":"Komitenin önerileri uyarınca, üç örgüt BH Güvenlik Bakanlığı çatısı altında tek bir güç meydana getirecek.

Article: When people think of Hollywood, they think of the city where dreams come true. This did not apply to F. Scott Fitzgerald, a screenwriter who had his share of ups and downs in this land. Fitzgerald was not a successful Hollywood writer because he was not good at the career path he chose. He was an amazing novelist, but his efforts of turning them into screenplays ended in disappointment and confusion. It was because of a lack of potential for screenwriting as well as his addiction and desire to be famous. Growing up as a boy, Fitzgerald went to movies a lot. He wanted to write stories that would eventually turn into movies. The problem was: just because Fitzgerald wanted to do something didn't necessarily mean that he was good at it. He made his attempts, but most of these efforts ended in disappointment because he thought about the change from script to screen too much. His plot was too detailed and complicated; his tone was too serious or his dialogue too sentimental . Fitzgerald's quick rise to fame also led to his fall. In life, things are not meant to happen all at once, all that the same time but it did for Fitzgerald. At his best time, three of his early stories were made into short films, including The Great Gatsby and Babylon Revisited. As the twenties approached, he was gradually forgotten by the reading public. He became drunk and constantly took pills both to sleep and wake up. His marriage was destroyed and his wife broke down mentally. He seemed unsure about his life. Fitzgerald had another chance at success when many opportunities came his way, including revisions of Emlyn William's play The Light of Heart and production of one of his own scripts, Cosmopolitan. However, these were all put aside and he was right back where he started, left behind and called a \\"ruined man\\". Fitzgerald simply wanted too much in his life.

Once we understand that, we can apply it to the given options and select the correct answer. Step 1: Determine the work done by 4 men in 2 days. The work done by 4 men is coloring a 48 m long cloth in 2 days. Step 2: Calculate the work done by 1 man in 1 day. Since there are 4 men, we can determine the work done by one person by dividing the total work by 4. Work of 1 man = (48 m cloth colored by 4 men) / 4 Work of 1 man = 12 m cloth colored in 2 days Now, we need to find the work done by 1 man in 1 day. Work of 1 man in 1 day = 12 m cloth colored / 2 days Work of 1 man in 1 day = 6 m cloth colored Step 3: Calculate the work done by 6 men in 1 day. We now know that 1 man can color 6 m of cloth in 1 day. Work of 6 men in 1 day = 6 m cloth * 6 men Work of 6 men in 1 day = 36 m cloth colored Step 4: Determine the number of days required for 6 men to color 72 m cloth. We know that 6 men can color 36 m long cloth in 1 day. We need to find how many days it would take for them to color a 72 m long cloth.

The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper.

Referring to himself as a \\"consulting detective\\" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard. First appearing in print in 1887 (in A Study in Scarlet), the character's popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Details about Sherlock Holmes's life, except for the adventures in the books, are scarce in Conan Doyle's original stories. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective. An estimate of Holmes's age in \\"His Last Bow\\" places his year of birth at 1854; the story, set in August 1914, describes him as sixty years of age. His parents are not mentioned in the stories, although Holmes mentions that his \\"ancestors\\" were \\"country squires\\". In \\"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\\", he claims that his grandmother was sister to the French artist Vernet, without further clarifying whether this was Claude Joseph, Carle, or Horace Vernet. Holmes's brother Mycroft, seven years his senior, is a government official who appears in \\"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\\", \\"The Final Problem\\", and \\"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\\" and is mentioned in \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\". Mycroft has a unique civil service position as a kind of human database for all aspects of government policy. He lacks Sherlock's interest in physical investigation, however, preferring to spend his time at the Diogenes Club. Holmes says that he first developed his methods of deduction as an undergraduate; his earliest cases, which he pursued as an amateur, came from fellow university students. A meeting with a classmate's father led him to adopt detection as a profession, and he spent six years after university as a consultant before financial difficulties led him to accept John H. Watson as a fellow lodger in 1881 (when the first published story, A Study in Scarlet, begins). The two take lodgings at 221B Baker Street, London, an apartment at the upper (north) end of the street, up seventeen steps.

It is important to note that this passage does not discuss the personal life or family of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but rather provides a loose biographical picture of his famous character, Sherlock Holmes."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of person whose ancestral home was denied to her through agnatic primogeniture? , can you please find it? Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal.

When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge. Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy High-altitude military parachuting instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Dominic Jagger (Luca Bercovici) could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts. Pete is instead referred to Jagger's reckless ex-wife, ex-con Jessie Crossman (Yancy Butler) - who is unaware that Jagger is part of Ty's crew.

I also had a bottle of Inca Cola, which I hadn't had since studying abroad in Quito in 2006.

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. and the situation: David wants to revisit the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace. He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits.

Answer the following question: Which species would decrease in number, species A and species B? A:","output":"Species B would likely decrease in number over time. Since species A has helpful traits that contribute to better survival and reproduction, these traits would become more common in the population due to natural selection. On the other hand, species B has harmful traits that are not advantageous for survival or reproduction.

A wartime pilot who suffered a head-wound, even Manning himself started to doubt his mind, and wondered if he had suffered from a \\"blackout\\"?Manning's wife, Jill, convinced he is innocent, contacts lawyers, but the defending barrister refuses to see her and her imprisoned husband, because he wants to preserve an \\"objective view\\" on the case. She later wins the sympathy of the junior counsel Peter Tanner, who visits Manning in prison, believes in his protestation of innocence and makes the case his own. The trial begins at London's Old Bailey, where Tanner is opposed by his father, prosecuting counsel Geoffrey Tanner. The trial is presided over by Justice Harrington, whose wife is in the hospital undergoing a serious operation. It soon becomes evident that things are going badly for Manning. Jurors are seen expressing their belief in Manning's guilt even before the trial was over. Irene's mother gave hearsay evidence that Manning had given the victim sweets, breaking down in tears and accusing Manning of murder. Following the testimony of prosecution-witness Horace Clifford, all of the evidence seems to point to Manning's guilt.

Not one car pulled off the interstate all morning. Nothing hit the drive but a thin steady rain, puddling slow rainbows in the oil. Me and Harnie just tilted back our chairs against the cigarette rack, watched the monster movie, and waited for the game to start. The big flying turtle was about set to barbeque downtown Tokyo when the drive bell rang, and up sluiced a car so damn gorgeous it hurt to look at it. A '37 Buick Roadmaster it was, painted a red so rich it was nearly black, that straight eight engine whispering like a lover while teardrops of rain rolled down the chrome grill. Out climbed this tall fellow, dressed like God's grandpa done up for a wedding or a funeral. His skin was brown as a buckwheat cake, with creases deep as drainage ditches. Took a mighty long stretch of sweat and toil, love and birth and dying, to carve a face like that. He flexed his shoulders, then rolled his neck till it cracked. He pulled a pack of Camel straights from inside his vest and flipped one out. \\"Got a light?\\" His voice was deep and warm, half gravel, half honey. I tossed him a pack of matches through the open door; he caught it left-handed, then flipped it open, folded over a match, and struck it with his thumb. \\"This the town with the dead fiddler?\\" he said after a long drag on the smoke. \\"You might say so,\\" I said, ignoring the look Harnie gave me. Nobody talked about her; I wondered how this fellow had even heard about her. \\"Ain't a fiddle, though. It's a cello, like in the symphony.\\" The stranger shrugged. \\"Close enough.\\" \\"She ain't d-dead, neither,\\" Harnie said. \\"M-more sleeping, like.\\" He puffed out a wreath of smoke. Then another. \\"Let's go wake her up,\\" he said. \\"You best not try, mister,\\" I said. \\"She been sleeping for thirty some year.\\" What did the man pull out of his vest? - Camels - not enough information - candy - money Answer:","output":"The man pulled out a pack of Camel straights from inside his vest. This detail can be found in the following sentence from the text: \\"He pulled a pack of Camel straights from inside his vest and flipped one out.\\" The man proceeds to ask for a light and the narrator tosses him a pack of matches, which he uses to light his cigarette.

Gary Neville has attacked Manchester United’s bizarre transfer policy after claiming the sale of Danny Welbeck for just £16m is ‘strange’.

Neville said: ‘It’s not the way I would expect United to go about their business, I thought it would be more controlled. VIDEO Scroll down to see Phil Neville's thoughts on Welbeck's transfer Manchester United sold Danny Welbeck to rivals Arsenal for £16million after the arrival of Radamel Falcao ‘I can’t work it out and I know I worked with Danny Welbeck last week [with England], but it’s odd. I have to admit I thought the Danny Welbeck sale was a strange one, but that’s just me.

By choosing this option, we can see the direct connection to the subject of the passage, which is Danny Welbeck's transfer from Manchester United to Arsenal. Gary Neville's comments express his confusion regarding the decision to sell Welbeck for £16 million, and by adding Welbeck's perspective on the matter, we are given further insight into the situation. Welbeck's preference to play in the center forward position aligns with his move to Arsenal, where he would likely have more opportunities to play in his favored position and prove his worth as a player. In addition, mentioning Welbeck's statement directly ties the issue back to the player's personal experience with the transfer and the club, providing a more human aspect to the situation. While Gary Neville criticizes the club's management for their transfer decisions, hearing from Welbeck himself allows the reader to understand how the player himself feels about the move, emphasizing his eagerness to perform and showcase his abilities in a new environment."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrete works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. Zappa was born on December 21, 1940 in Baltimore, Maryland. His mother, Rosemarie (nee Collimore) was of Italian (Neapolitan and Sicilian) and French ancestry; his father, whose name was anglicized to Francis Vincent Zappa, was an immigrant from Partinico, Sicily, with Greek and Arab ancestry. Frank, the eldest of four children, was raised in an Italian-American household where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical warfare facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home in case of an accident. This had a profound effect on Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work. Zappa was often sick as a child, suffering from asthma, earaches and sinus problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of radium into each of Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation, and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant enough evidence to confirm this. Nasal imagery and references appear in his music and lyrics, as well as in the collage album covers created by his long-time collaborator Cal Schenkel. Zappa believed his childhood diseases might have been due to exposure to mustard gas, released by the nearby chemical warfare facility. His health worsened when he lived in Baltimore. In 1952, his family relocated for reasons of health. They next moved to Monterey, California, where his father taught metallurgy at the Naval Postgraduate School. They soon moved to Claremont, California, then to El Cajon, before finally settling in San Diego.

Article: Corky was a brave young man and he dreamed of becoming the best fighter in the world. To become stronger and get better fighting skills, he went to many schools. One day, he went to the best school in the world. Before entering the gate, he was made to hand in all his weapons . \\"You won't need those any more. Here you'll get better ones,\\" said the guard. Corky handed his weapons to him. A serious old teacher took Corky to his room. Before he left, he said to Corky, \\"In a hundred days the training will start.\\" A hundred days! At first Corky thought that was a joke, but he soon realized the old teacher had been serious. Corky felt nervous during the first days and he tried many ways to try to get the teacher to start the training. However, it didn't work. At last Corky waited patiently and enjoyed each day in the school. \\"You've already learned how to use your main weapon - patience,\\" said the old teacher. Corky could hardly believe it, but he really understood that the teacher was right. Finally, the lesson began. \\"Now it's time to learn how to win every fight,\\" said the old teacher. That sounded good to Corky until he found himself tied hand and foot. Many villagers tried to hit him because they were told that Corky was a dangerous man. The same thing was repeated for days, and Corky knew he had to do something. He realized that the only way would be to deal with the villagers' anger . In the following days, Corky kept talking to them until he managed to make them believe that he was not an enemy. In the end, the villagers made friends with Corky. Finally, Corky knew what the most powerful weapon was. He said thanks to the teacher and left. Question: Why did the old teacher tell Corky that the training would start in a hundred days? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The old teacher told Corky that the training would start in a hundred days as a lesson in patience. This was a part of his teaching methods. The extended time frame was not necessarily meant for physical training but for mental training. By making him wait, the teacher was training Corky to develop patience and learn to enjoy each day despite the anticipation and uncertainty. This aspect of patience, as the teacher later explained, was a key weapon for Corky to master first before his actual combat training began. It was a critical part in shaping Corky's mindset and approach towards his goal of becoming a fighter, hinting at the understanding that not all battles are won through physical strength alone."},{"instruction":"I friendzoned a guy because I didn't want anything more than a friendship.

Interestingly, there's another record mentioned of 2:54:22 of the same year, which might be a world record (WR), though it's less clear what specific achievement this refers to. Considering the birth date range provided, the runner would have been aged between 43 and 44 as of the update year mentioned as 2013.

He would get up in the morning, and then put them in what state again? Options: - upside down - in motion - active - wakefulness - resthold The answer is \\"in motion\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"in motion\\" because the context of the question revolves around James's bouncing rubber balls, which are inherently objects intended for movement and kinetic activity. When James goes to sleep, he puts the bouncing rubber balls at rest as this ensures that there is no disturbance as he sleeps. This implies that when James wakes up in the morning, he would want to place the bouncing rubber balls in a state opposite to their nighttime resting state, which would be in motion. The other options provided do not accurately fit the given scenario: 1. \\"Upside down\\" – This term does not apply to rubber balls as they are generally symmetrical and have no specific orientation. 2. \\"Active\\" – While the term \\"active\\" could potentially describe the state of the rubber balls when they are bouncing, it does not clearly define the motion and physics involved in their intended use. The term \\"in motion\\" more specifically captures the essence of the bouncing rubber balls. 3. \\"Wakefulness\\" – This term is typically used to describe consciousness in living beings and does not fit the context of bouncing rubber balls. 4. \\"Resthold\\" – This option has no relevance to the context of the question, as it is a term likely referring to a hold or position designed for rest and does not apply to bouncing rubber balls. In conclusion, \\"in motion\\" is the correct answer to the question because it directly relates to the bouncing rubber balls' intended purpose and accurately describes their state when James wakes up in the morning to play with them. This answer demonstrates that the balls transition from a resting state during the night to a state of motion as James becomes active during the day, highlighting the contrast between the two states of the rubber balls."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer: If \\"A woman in high heels is walking away.\\", does it logically follow that \\"woman in heels leaves\\"? 1). yes 2). it is not possible to tell 3). no","output":"1). yes The statement \\"A woman in high heels is walking away\\" implies that the woman is leaving or moving away from a certain location.

Physical reasoning tasks are designed to evaluate a person's ability to analyze and predict the behavior of objects and the forces acting upon them. A suitable task should encompass elements such as motion, forces, energy, and everyday situations where physics can be applied. An ideal task to test physical reasoning could be: Designing and Building a Rube Goldberg Machine A Rube Goldberg machine is a contraption that accomplishes a simple task using a series of complex and interconnected devices. Each device in the machine triggers the subsequent device, creating a chain reaction of events that eventually leads to the completion of the task. Building a Rube Goldberg machine requires creativity, critical thinking, and a strong understanding of the principles of physics. This task will test a person's ability to apply physical reasoning to design, construct, and evaluate the machine successfully. The task can be broken down into several detailed steps: 1. Define the simple task to be accomplished: Choose a straightforward task, such as popping a balloon, ringing a bell, or pouring a glass of water. This will be the final action of the Rube Goldberg machine. 2. Brainstorm potential devices and connections: List out the various objects and materials that can be used in the machine, considering their physical properties, such as size, shape, weight, and functionality. Ensure that the objects are readily available and safe to use. 3. Incorporate different mechanisms and principles of physics: Plan ways to include different mechanisms, such as levers, pulleys, inclined planes, and gears, in the machine. Design the machine in a way that makes use of different physical concepts, like gravity, friction, momentum, energy conservation, and Newton's Laws of Motion. 4. Sketch the machine: Create a visual blueprint of the Rube Goldberg machine, showing each device and how they connect to create the chain-reaction. Ensure the sketch is detailed and clear enough to be used as a reference while constructing the machine. 5. Build the machine: Using the sketch as a reference, gather the necessary materials and tools, and start assembling the devices sequentially. Regularly test each connection and device, making adjustments as needed, and ensure that devices safely and effectively trigger the subsequent device according to plan. 6. Fine-tune and troubleshoot: Once the machine has been built, fine-tune the connections and device positions. Identify any potential issues or problems that might hinder the machine's successful completion of the task. Troubleshoot any issues and make adjustments as needed. 7. Run the final test: Trigger the first device in the machine, and observe the chain reaction as each device activates the next one. The ultimate test of physical reasoning abilities will be if the machine successfully completes the chosen task with the least amount of intervention. Designing and building a Rube Goldberg machine tests a person's ability to apply their understanding of physics to design and construct a complex, interactive mechanism successfully. This task showcases their capacity for physical reasoning, problem-solving, and critical thinking in a real-world setting."},{"instruction":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

Sentence 2: The speaker is expressing that the situation isn't so bad. There might be some level of badness, but it's not that significant. Step 2: Compare the meanings of the sentences Both sentences convey the idea that the situation is not as bad as it could have been. Sentence 1 emphasizes a change in opinion/thought, while Sentence 2 conveys an overall sentiment about the situation. Step 3: Evaluate the relationship between the two sentences If Sentence 1 is true, it means that the speaker no longer thinks the situation is as bad as they originally thought. This implies that the speaker now has a more positive or less negative view of the situation. If Sentence 2 is also true, it means the speaker believes the situation isn't so bad. This also indicates a less negative view of the situation.

Options are: - yes; - it is not possible to tell; - no;","output":"It is not possible to tell whether \\"The person does it of their own accord\\" if you can't help it, as there could be various factors at play that determine the involvement of an individual's voluntary actions. In order to provide a detailed understanding, it is essential to consider different circumstances and perspectives that might be involved. To start, the phrase \\"of their own accord\\" implies that the individual is acting based on their free will and personal choices rather than external influences or force from others. However, when you say, \\"If I can't help it...\\", it suggests there may be some limits on your ability to intervene, assist or influence the person's actions or decisions. From a psychological standpoint, human actions can result from complex interactions between one's biological make-up, social environments, personal experiences, and cognitive processes. These internal and external factors can sometimes make it difficult to clearly identify the core motivations driving an individual's actions and whether they act of their own accord or as a result of outside factors. For example, consider a person struggling to quit smoking despite receiving support, advice, and motivation from their friends and family. Their inability to quit might stem from physical addiction or habits formed over years of smoking, making it hard for them to exercise their free will effectively. In this scenario, it might be inaccurate to conclude that the person continues smoking \\"of their own accord,\\" as there may be internal struggles that make quitting challenging. On the other hand, a person working hard to achieve a personal goal, such as entering a specific career field, might face similar obstacles, including difficulty in finding resources, networking, or even battling self-doubt at times. Despite these issues, their persistence and resilience could be seen as acting \\"of their own accord\\" because they are driven by their inner desires and aspirations. Given the complexity of human behavior and the multitude of factors that influence our actions, it is not possible to generalize whether a person acts of their own accord without considering the specific circumstances and factors involved. Therefore, it is crucial to examine each situation on a case-by-case basis to determine the root causes and motivations behind an individual's actions and assess whether they are indeed acting according to their free will."},{"instruction":"Another visit, another wait of over an hour and I am still in the waiting room.

Sentence A: \\"he drink much alcohol while exercise\\" 1. Meaning: This sentence is trying to convey that someone is drinking a lot of alcohol while exercising. 2. Grammar: The sentence has some grammatical mistakes: a. It should use \\"drinks\\" instead of \\"drink\\" to match the third-person singular subject \\"he.\\" b. \\"exercise\\" should be \\"exercising\\" to maintain verb consistency (gerund form for both \\"drink\\" and \\"exercise\\").

The unforeseen circumstances have pushed the business to dock its fleet of boats at the dry dock, throwing a wrench in the works for both its employees and loyal customers. The spill, which occurred due to an unfortunate accident involving a fuel tanker, has raised major concerns regarding the safety and environmental impact of the company's operations. As a responsible business owner, the management team has made the difficult decision to prioritize the well-being of the local marine ecosystem, as well as the reputation of their business, over their immediate economic interests. Step by step, the company is working tirelessly to mitigate the damage caused by the spill. Firstly, they mobilized a team of trained professionals to clean up the affected area. The team skillfully contained the spill and began the process of removing the hazardous materials from the water to ensure no further harm to the ecosystem. This also helped reduce the risk of potential legal implications and fines associated with the spill. Secondly, the company's management decided to embark on a thorough inspection of their fleet to ensure that the boats are in optimal working condition. This was a necessary move to guarantee that no similar incidents occur in the future and to uphold their commitment to safety and environmental responsibility. By taking this step, the company aims to regain the trust of its customers and stakeholders. Finally, the management has pledged to invest in employee training and education to further emphasize the importance of safety measures and awareness. The goal is to develop a skilled workforce capable of handling any unexpected challenges or emergencies that may arise during their operations. As the boat business struggles to bounce back from the setback caused by the spill, it is important for the community to rally around and support local businesses in these trying times. With a host of safety and quality measures now in place, the company aims to resume operations as soon as possible, while ensuring that such incidents are prevented in the future."},{"instruction":"Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Clean a saucepan with stuck on food.

Rinse with hot water and brush again with more soap if necessary.; 2. Place the saucepan in an empty sink and fill it with hot water and a few drops of dish soap; let it sit for 10 minutes, then find a clean hair brush and gently brush food bits away. Rinse with hot water and brush again with more soap if necessary.;","output":"Option 1 is the better solution for cleaning a saucepan with stuck-on food. Let's discuss both options in detail to understand why that is the case: Option 1: In this method, you are placing the saucepan in an empty sink and filling it with hot water and a few drops of dish soap. This combination is effective for loosening stuck-on food particles. By letting the saucepan sit for 10 minutes, you give the hot water and dish soap time to soften and break down the food, making it easier to clean. Using a clean dish brush in the next step is the appropriate tool for the job. Dish brushes are designed specifically for cleaning dishes, making them effective at removing stuck-on food particles. Brushes used for cleaning dishes have stiff, durable bristles that are safe for use on kitchenware and are typically non-scratch, meaning that they won't damage the surface of your saucepan. After you gently brush away the food bits, rinsing with hot water helps to further loosen any remaining residue. You may need to brush again with more soap and rinse if necessary, but this method should effectively clean the saucepan. Option 2: This option is also based on the same initial steps of filling the saucepan with hot water and dish soap, allowing it to sit for 10 minutes. This process should still help with softening and breaking down the stuck-on food particles. However, the main difference between the two options is using a clean hair brush instead of a dish brush. Hair brushes are not designed for cleaning kitchenware and are typically used for detangling and grooming hair. Their bristles may be too soft or not effective in removing food particles from the saucepan. Moreover, using a hair brush for cleaning dishes can also contaminate the brush with food particles and bacteria, making it unhygienic for its original purpose. Considering these factors, Option 1 is the better solution for cleaning a saucepan with stuck-on food. It employs a dish brush designed specifically for cleaning dishes, reducing the risk of damage to the saucepan and ensuring a more effective and efficient cleaning process."},{"instruction":"Mnohokrát.

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If fewer organisms thrive in the ecosystem, there may be less diversity and fewer interactions between species. This could lead to less support for tree networks to form or grow. As fewer organisms thrive, the overall health of the ecosystem may decline. When this happens, there might be fewer tree networks forming because these organisms play a crucial role in maintaining the cycle of nutrient recycling, seed dispersal, pollination, and more. This reduction in tree networks can have a cascading effect on the ecosystem, making it even more challenging for other organisms to thrive. So, in this case, fewer organisms thriving could cause fewer tree networks to form, which could then negatively impact the organism population further.

(Photo: USA TODAY) To confirm a diagnosis of Alzheimer's today, a patient either needs a painful spinal tap or a costly brain image. But several detection tools under development offer the promise of at least ruling out Alzheimer's easily and inexpensively in a doctor's office. In new research to be presented this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Denmark, scientists show progress developing detection methods that rely on the blood, sense of smell and protein build-up in the eyes. All have been tested in dozens to hundreds of patients. \\"Those are now moving into the more serious realm,\\" said Maria Carrillo, vice president of medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer's Association. \\"So we're very excited about this.\\" Among people with mild memory problems, a reduced sense of smell effectively predicted who would go on to get Alzheimer's, according to one study to be presented today. Also, older, healthy people were more likely to have memory declines if they scored lower on a smell test, said Davangere Devanand, a psychiatrist and director of the division of geriatric psychiatry at Columbia University. Other studies include one suggesting that a device the size of a desktop computer can detect Alzheimer's by looking at the lens of a patient's eye. Beta amyloid, a protein that builds up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, is detectable in the lens, potentially before symptoms appear, said Paul Hartung, president and CEO of the Massachusetts-based company Cognoptix that is developing the device. And in another study reported recently, researchers at King's College London and UK proteomics company, Proteome Sciences, found that a panel of 10 proteins in the blood can help identify people with the brain shrinkage that is characteristic of mild memory loss and Alzheimer's. None of these tests is likely to be perfect predictors of Alzheimer's, though, said Ralph Nixon, chairman of the Alzheimer's Association's Medical & Scientific Advisory Council, and a professor of psychiatry and cell biology at New York University School of Medicine. Everyone with Alzheimer's has beta amyloid in their brain, but not everyone with beta amyloid buildup will develop Alzheimer's, limiting the predictive ability of some of these tests. Their best use may be to help flag people who need costlier testing, or to quickly rule out Alzheimer's as a cause of symptoms, said Devanand, who does not expect the smell test to be definitive. The other long-term hope is that these sensory and blood tests may be able to predict Alzheimer's risk long before symptoms appear. In recent years, trials of drugs to change the course of Alzheimer's have all been failures. Researchers believe that's because the drugs are given after too much damage has occurred – but right now, they can't identify the disease any earlier. Earlier diagnosis offers the possibility of treating people sooner, when medications may be more effective, said Matthew Growdon, a medical student at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health. At the conference Growdon will also present research on the link between odor identification and the biological characteristics of Alzheimer's. The smell test is a 15 to 20 minute quiz in which the participant has to scratch and sniff one box at a time and identify its odor from among four options such as pizza, gasoline, apple and chocolate. The scents are intentionally different because many people would have trouble with more subtle distinctions – say, between and apple and a strawberry. And, the test is meant to be easy, Devanand said. By itself, a lousy sense of smell doesn't predict Alzheimer's – so people shouldn't worry if they don't discern smells as well as a family member, Devanand said. Respiratory infections, allergies, smoking and other factors can all reduce smelling ability. \\"It is not as if, if you score poorly, you are sure to have Alzheimer's,\\" he said.

That number is expected to increase dramatically in the decades ahead. On Sunday, researchers announced the promising results of a study on a new test to pick up on the disease years - if not decades - in advance. And they're looking for signs in an unusual place: the eye. These bright dots are proteins called beta amyloids visible in the retina of a patient diagnosed with Alzheimer's diseases. Beta amyloids are typically found in the brain and have been known to be linked to Alzheimer's. Dr. James Galvin is a neurologist at New York University Langone Medical Center. \\"What makes it unique is that the retina is actually an extension of the brain and so we think that a lot of the pathology that is occurring in the brain may also be occurring in the retina,\\" he said. CBS News Australian researcher Shaun Frost tested 40 people using a liquid form of curcumin, the natural substance that makes curry yellow. Curcumin sticks to beta amyloids, allowing doctors to spot the proteins with a simple eye test. Frost found that the test positively identified 100 percent of the participants who had Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's so far is incurable, so why is it important to be able to detect it? \\"Well, for several reasons. So we have medicines today that treat the symptoms of the disease, so you'd like to be able to pick up the disease as soon as possible, so you can start someone on an available medicine. But more importantly, in order to develop new therapies, we need to be able to identify people at the earliest stages,\\" said Galvin. Currently, the disease is detected through spinal taps or PET scans, which are invasive, expensive and not readily available. The developers of the eye test say it can predict the onset of Alzheimer's 15 to 20 years before clinical diagnosis. The full study, involving 200 subjects, is expected to be completed earlier this year. |||||","output":"Researchers have been developing new detection methods for Alzheimer's that rely on blood, sense of smell, and protein build-up in the eyes.

NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context. Over time, \\"new wave\\" acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated \\"new wave\\" and no longer called \\"punk\\".

How to stop ogling Follow the three-second rule. It's natural to glance at people as they walk by you, and a quick glance is usually okay. But if you find yourself looking for longer than 3 seconds, you're ogling.","output":"To stop ogling, it is essential to understand why it is essential to do so and to implement practical strategies to control your gaze. Ogling can make the person you are staring at feel uncomfortable and objectified, leading to an unhealthy environment. Here are some practical steps you can take to stop this behavior: 1. Acknowledge the issue: The first step to stop ogling is to admit that you have a problem. Recognize that it is inappropriate, disrespectful, and potentially offensive to those you stare at. Accepting that you need to change your behavior will help you move forward. 2. Practice self-awareness: Pay attention to your behaviors and actions, especially in social situations. Be aware of where your eyes are looking, and consciously choose to look away or engage in conversation if you find yourself ogling. 3. Develop empathy: Put yourself in the shoes of the person you are ogling. Imagine how uncomfortable and uneasy it would make you feel to have someone staring at you. Empathizing with the other person will help you understand the impact of your actions and make it easier to control your gaze. 4. Engage in conversation: If you find yourself ogling someone, try starting a conversation with them, focusing on their thoughts and opinions rather than their appearance. This can help you see them as more than just a physical object and train your brain to focus on their personality. 5. Redirect your focus: When you feel the urge to ogle, shift your focus to something else. This could mean looking around the room, focusing on your drink or a book, or even just thinking about something else entirely. The goal is to distract yourself from the desire to stare. 6. Use visualization techniques: Visualization techniques can help you train your brain to avoid ogling. Start by visualizing yourself in a situation where you would usually ogle, then imagine yourself behaving respectfully and appropriately instead. Over time, this practice can help you to change your behavior in real-life situations. 7. Set goals and track progress: Set goals for yourself to reduce or eliminate ogling, and evaluate how well you are progressing regularly. Keep a journal or a record of your progress to ensure you are on the right track and make adjustments if needed. 8. Seek support: Confiding in a friend or family member about your desire to stop ogling can hold you accountable and provide encouragement and motivation throughout the process. It also helps surround yourself with positive role models and engage in social activities where respectful behavior is the norm. 9. Practice mindfulness and meditation: Mindfulness exercises and meditation can help improve self-awareness and control over your thoughts and actions. Spending time each day practicing mindfulness or meditation can help you stay focused and make better choices in your daily life, including avoiding ogling. 10. Seek professional help if necessary: If you find that your ogling is impacting your relationships or daily life, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide personalized guidance to help you overcome your tendencies and develop healthier habits. By taking these steps to stop ogling, you can cultivate a more respectful and considerate attitude towards others, leading to healthier and more fulfilling social interactions. Remember that changing ingrained habits can take time, so be patient and keep working on it."},{"instruction":"Which of the following is a prime number ?

Sunset Boulevard (stylized onscreen as SUNSET BLVD.) is a 1950 American film noir directed and co-written by Billy Wilder, and produced and co-written by Charles Brackett. It was named after the thoroughfare that runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills, California. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter, and Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded silent-film star who draws him into her fantasy world, where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. The street known as Sunset Boulevard has been associated with Hollywood film production since 1911, when the town's first film studio opened there. The film workers lived modestly in the growing neighborhood, but during the 1920s, profits and salaries rose to unprecedented levels. With the advent of the star system, luxurious homes noted for their often incongruous grandeur were built in the area. As a young man living in Berlin in the 1920s, Billy Wilder was interested in American culture, with much of his interest fueled by the country's films. In the late 1940s, many of the grand Hollywood houses remained, and Wilder, then a Los Angeles resident, found them to be a part of his everyday world. Many former stars from the silent era still lived in them, although most were no longer involved in the film business. Wilder wondered how they spent their time now that \\"the parade had passed them by\\" and began imagining the story of a star who had lost her celebrity and box-office appeal. The character of Norma Desmond mirrors aspects of the twilight years of several real-life faded silent-film stars, such as the reclusive existence of Mary Pickford and the mental disorders of Mae Murray and Clara Bow. It is usually regarded as a fictional composite inspired by several different people, not just a thinly disguised portrait of one in particular. Nevertheless, some commentators have tried to identify specific models.

This match-up would see two 10-1 teams face one another for the first time since 1990 when the New York Giants lost to the San Francisco 49ers. Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo faced off against his boyhood idol Brett Favre in the game. The Packers started the game missing two key players of their defense, with injured cornerback Charles Woodson (tied for 7th in the NFL with 4 interceptions) and pass-rushing end Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila (tied for 6th in the NFL with 9.5 sacks) on the inactive list. In the first quarter, Green Bay took the early lead as rookie kicker Mason Crosby completed a 47-yard field goal. On the first play of the Cowboys opening drive, Al Harris stripped the ball from Terrell Owens and side judge Laird Hayes signaled Green Bay ball, but head linesman Derick Bowers overruled him. The only option for Mike McCarthy to challenge on the play, since the whistle was blown, was whether it was a reception - the strip could not be reviewed. The replay upheld the reception and Dallas retained possession. Nick Folk completed a 26-yard field goal to tie the game. Folk also completed a 51-yard field goal, and QB Tony Romo threw a 3-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton. The Packers would end the first quarter with rookie RB Ryan Grant running for a 62-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Dallas responded with Romo completing a 26-yard TD pass to TE Anthony Fasano and a 10-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens. Brett Favre left the game in the second quarter after he hit his right elbow on the helmet of a blitzing Cowboys DB Nate Jones. The throw led to Favre's second interception. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers took over for the Packers next series and led the offense on a 74-yard drive, capping it off with an 11-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings. In the third, Grant finished off a 69-yard Packer drive with a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the quarter. In the fourth quarter, Romo completed a 4-yard TD pass to Crayton. Mason Crosby kicked a 52-yard field goal with just over 5&#160;minutes remaining in the game to pull the Packers within a field goal. Dallas sealed the win as Folk kicked a 25-yard field goal with 1:03 left in the game. The Packers were flagged for a season-high 142 penalty yards. Question: Which team scored more points in the second quarter? Answer:","output":"In the second quarter, the Dallas Cowboys scored more points. They scored with a 26-yard TD pass to TE Anthony Fasano and a 10-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens. The Packers scored with a 74-yard drive, capped off with an 11-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings. So, the Cowboys scored 14 points in the second quarter while the Packers scored 7 points."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, You are given an open-domain question that can be answered based on factual information.

Article: A private sixth grade is set to start its lessons at 1.30 pm every day because the school's teacher thinks his students will study better after a morning lie-in . Instead of rising early for a 9 am start, students at the PS15,000-a-year Hampton Court House, in East Molesey, Surrey, will get to enjoy a lie-in and work from 1.30 pm until 7pm. Head teacher Guy Holloway says the move for all sixth grade students, set to begin from September, has been made according to research by scientists. He predicts that not only will his students aged 16 and upwards get great night's sleep, but their productivity will also be improved. The co-educational school will have the latest start time in the UK, and will be the only one to begin lessons in the afternoon. Experts say young people are programmed to get up later, and that rather than laziness it is simply a shift in their body clocks. 'There are 168 hours in a week and how productive they are depends on how they choose to use those hours,' said Mr Holloway. 'At Hampton Court House we don't think we have the answer for everybody; it's about what works in our school. We want to get them into a condition where they can get great sleep and study well.' He said students would also benefit from reduced journey times as they travel to and from school after rush hour . Year 10 student Gabriel Purcell-Davis will be one of the first of 30 A-level students to start at the later time. 'I want to wake up in my bed, not in my maths lesson,' said the 15-year-old. Lessons for all other students at the school will still begin at 9 am as usual. Question: Why did the school decide to start the class at 1.30 pm? Options: A: It may be good for students' study. B: Students wanted a morning lie-in. C: Students were often late for school. D: Teachers wanted to have a good sleep in the morning.

Oslo was initially founded around 1048 by King Harald III, who was also known as Harald Hardråde (or Harald Hardrada in English). The site of the original settlement was located at the eastern end of the Oslo Fjord, which provided an ideal natural harbor and strategic location for trade and defense. In 1624, a devastating fire swept through the city, leaving most of it in ruins. Recognizing the importance of rebuilding the city, King Christian IV of Denmark and Norway ordered its reconstruction on a new site, slightly west of the original location. The city was then renamed Christiania, in honor of the monarch. The new city was laid out with broader streets and constructed primarily with stone and brick to minimize the risk of future fires. Later, in 1877, the spelling of the city's name was altered to \\"Kristiania.\\" For a long time, Christiania maintained its status as the political, economic, and cultural center of Norway. However, following the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905, a growing sentiment of nationalism took hold, and many Norwegians longed to reconnect with their historical roots. This movement eventually led to the city's name being reverted to its original name, Oslo, in 1925. Today, Oslo is a thriving city known for its vibrant culture, rich history, and beautiful surrounding landscapes. It houses the Royal Palace, the Norwegian Parliament, and various important museums like the Viking Ship Museum, the Munch Museum, and the Nobel Peace Center. Furthermore, Oslo has a reputation for its green spaces, such as the Vigeland Park and the Ekebergparken Sculpture Park, along with its beautiful waterfront promenade, Aker Brygge. In conclusion, the city that was founded around 1048 by King Harald III, destroyed by fire and rebuilt by King Christian IV as Christiania, and ultimately reverted to its original name, Oslo, in 1925, is a significant urban center in Norway with a fascinating history and an enduring legacy as the country's capital."},{"instruction":"Choose your reply from the options at the end.

To provide some context to this answer, let us take a detailed look at the situation: The English Premier League (EPL) was founded on February 20, 1992, as a breakaway from the English Football League (EFL). The new league was established to increase commercial revenue and football quality through heightened exposure and investment. Formed by 22 clubs, the Premier League aimed to become the most competitive and attractive football league in the world. Foreign players have undeniably played a crucial role in achieving the Premier League's goals, with pivotal contributions to the league's commercial, technical, and cultural growth. Over the years, more and more clubs began recognizing the value of recruiting foreign players due to their diverse skills, styles, and experiences. However, this was not the case when the Premier League was first established in 1992–93. At that time, there were only eleven foreign players from outside the United Kingdom or Ireland appearing in the starting line-ups for the opening round of matches, indicating a rather low level of international player involvement compared to the current landscape. It is crucial to note that this figure specifically refers to the first round of games, and it is likely that other foreign players would have joined the league throughout the 1992-93 season and beyond. But, regardless of this, the statement certainly answers the original question effectively. In conclusion, the given statement accurately answers the question by identifying that there were eleven foreign players present within starting line-ups for the first round of matches during the 1992-93 Premier League season.

The first statement, \\"So we all have benefited indirectly,\\" suggests that everyone involved has experienced some sort of positive effect or gain, albeit not in a direct manner. Indirect benefits can occur through various connections or events, which ultimately lead to an advantageous outcome for those concerned. This indicates that there is a network of benefits and advantages at play that are being channeled through multiple layers, ultimately reaching everyone involved or impacted. For instance, if a company generates more revenue and in turn, provides higher salaries and better facilities for its employees, the local economy in which those employees reside will experience positive changes too. In contrast, the statement \\"Nobody has benefited, not even indirectly\\" implies that no individual or group has experienced any advantages, either directly or indirectly. This could be due to a lack of overall positive outcomes in a given situation or that the negative consequences outweigh any possible benefits, rendering them negligible. This statement conveys a more pessimistic viewpoint that nothing positive has emerged or been experienced in one's environment or interactions. Therefore, to conclude that \\"Nobody has benefited, not even indirectly\\" is directly contradicted by the initial statement that \\"So we all have benefited indirectly.\\" The two ideas oppose each other and cannot coexist in the same context. It is essential to carefully analyze and understand the context and the reasons behind each statement to form an appropriate understanding of a given situation."},{"instruction":"Arrays are islands with limited cross array management where moving data between arrays is cumbersome, leading to historically over-provisioned and underutilized system.

To give some background, club owners and stakeholders had been discussing the idea of breaking away from the existing Football League system to generate more revenue. The key turning point came when the Founder Members Agreement was signed on 17 July 1991 by the top-flight clubs, which established the foundational principles for the new FA Premier League. This new league provided clubs with the ability to negotiate their own broadcast and sponsorship agreements, opening up the potential for significant financial growth. The main argument given at the time was that the additional income would enable English clubs to compete effectively with teams across Europe. As a result, the proposal in 1991 was not postponed.

Before his appearance in \\"Transformers: The Last Knight,\\" Tucci had already built a strong reputation in Hollywood through his diverse roles in a variety of genres. Some of his notable works include \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" (2006), where he played the character of Nigel, \\"Julie & Julia\\" (2009) as Paul Child, and \\"The Hunger Games\\" film series (2012-2015), in which he portrayed Caesar Flickerman.

Merlin uses his alleged magical abilities, which were, in fact, advanced technology provided by the Transformers, to help King Arthur and his knights in their fight against their foes. Besides Stanley Tucci, the film stars Mark Wahlberg, Josh Duhamel, Anthony Hopkins, Laura Haddock, and Isabela Moner, among others.

Although Captain Ben Richards [Robert Ayres] of the Air Force Space Command says that Dan is the best pilot they have, he bucked the rules when flying Y-12, went into the ionosphere, had problems landing his ship, and then promptly ran to see his girlfriend, Tia Francesca [Marla Landi], before bothering to even make out his report. Still, Capt Richards wants Dan to pilot the Y-13, after he has been throughly checked out and briefed by Doctor Paul von Essen [Carl Jaffe].Y-13 takes off with Dan at the controls. He climbs and climbs. At 600,000 feet, when he is supposed to level off and begin his descent, he continues to climb, even firing his emergency boost. He climbs to 1,320,000 feet (250 miles) and suddenly loses control of the ship and passes through some meteorite dust, so he is forced to catapult.The next that is heard about Y-13 is a report to the New Mexico State Police that some Mexican farmer saw a parachute attached to some sort of plane land near his farm on Route 17 about 10 miles south of Alvarado.

The bin was strategically placed close to the stove to ensure that the vegetables could be easily added to the pot of soup. As the cook dumped the vegetables into the pot, the enticing aroma of the soup began to fill the air. The cook recognized the importance of layering flavors and ensuring that the vegetables were cooked to perfection. Watching with a keen eye, the cook monitored the soup as the vegetable pieces swam in the simmering broth. The soup base was a rich blend of vegetable stock, carefully brewed from the remnants of other vegetable dishes. The cook, a master of their craft, understood that combining the essence of different vegetables created a more complex and delicious flavor. The broth was fortified with herbs such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary, as well as seasoned with salt and pepper to enhance the taste. As the vegetables began to release their flavors into the soup, the pot gradually filled up. The cook continued adding vegetables from the bin to the pot, observing as the contents expanded and thickened. This delicate balancing act was crucial to achieving the right consistency and texture for the dish. Additionally, the cook had to gauge when the right amount of vegetables had been added to yield a hearty, satisfying meal for the diners. Eventually, the pot reached its capacity, brimming with a medley of root vegetables and garden greens. The cook carefully stirred the soup to evenly distribute the ingredients. The mixture simmered for longer, allowing the flavors to mingle and produce a delectable symphony.

All four friends decided to buy a t-shirt. The original price of the t-shirt was 20 dollars. How much money did they spend in total? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Step 1: Determine the discount on each t-shirt. The original price of each t-shirt is 20 dollars, and there's a 50% discount on every item. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 50% of 20 dollars. 20 * 0.50 = 10 dollars This means each t-shirt's price is reduced by 10 dollars. Step 2: Find the price of the t-shirt after the 50% discount. To find the new price of each t-shirt, subtract the discount (10 dollars) from the original price (20 dollars). 20 - 10 = 10 dollars So, each t-shirt will cost 10 dollars after the discount. Step 3: Calculate the total cost for all four friends. Since all four friends are buying one t-shirt each at the discounted price, we need to multiply the price of one t-shirt with the number of friends. 4 friends * 10 dollars per t-shirt = 40 dollars Therefore, the four friends spent a total of 40 dollars on t-shirts at the clothes shop."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity.

Because of the dramatic drop in elevation of the two rivers, there were rumors of huge waterfalls and violent rapids, and Native American tales strengthened their credibility. In 1869, one-armed Civil War veteran John Wesley Powell led an expedition from Green River Station in Wyoming, aiming to run the two rivers all the way down to St. Thomas, Nevada, near present-day Hoover Dam. Powell and nine men – none of whom had prior whitewater experience – set out in May. After braving the rapids of the Gates of Lodore, Cataract Canyon and other gorges along the Colorado, the party arrived at the mouth of the Little Colorado River, where Powell noted down arguably the most famous words ever written about the Grand Canyon of the Colorado: We are now ready to start on our way down the Great Unknown. Our boats, tied to a common stake, are chafing each other, as they are tossed by the fretful river. They ride high and buoyant, for their loads are lighter than we could desire. We have but a month's rations remaining. The flour has been re-sifted through the mosquito net sieve; the spoiled bacon has been dried, and the worst of it boiled; the few pounds of dried apples have been spread in the sun, and re-shrunken to their normal bulk; the sugar has all melted, and gone on its way down the river; but we have a large sack of coffee. The lighting of the boats has this advantage: they will ride the waves better, and we shall have little to carry when we make a portage. We are three-quarters of a mile in the depths of the earth, and the great river shrinks into insignificance, as it dashes its angry waves against the walls and cliffs, that rise to the world above; they are but puny ripples, and we but pigmies, running up and down the sands, or lost among the boulders. We have an unknown distance yet to run; an unknown river yet to explore. What falls there are, we know not; what rocks beset the channel, we know not; what walls rise over the river, we know not; Ah, well! we may conjecture many things. The men talk as cheerfully as ever; jests are bandied about freely this morning; but to me the cheer is somber and the jests are ghastly.

Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would...

She bought 3 large ones and 6 small ones, for 48 total. If the large tubs cost 6, how much do the small ones cost? Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"To find the cost of the small storage tubs, we will follow these steps: 1. Find the total cost of the large storage tubs 2. Subtract the cost of the large storage tubs from the total cost to find the amount spent on the small storage tubs 3. Divide the remaining cost by the number of small storage tubs to find the cost of each small storage tub Step 1: Find the total cost of the large storage tubs Alison bought 3 large storage tubs. Each large tub costs 6, so the total cost of the large tubs will be 3 * 6 = 18. Step 2: Subtract the cost of the large storage tubs from the total cost The total cost of all the storage tubs is 48. So, the cost spent on small storage tubs is 48 - 18 = 30. Step 3: Divide the remaining cost by the number of small storage tubs Alison bought 6 small storage tubs. To find the cost of each small tub, we will divide the cost spent on small tubs (30) by the number of small tubs (6). So, 30 ÷ 6 = 5.

Burges died, aged 53, in his Red Bed at the Tower House, at 11.45 p.m. on Wednesday 20 April 1881. While on a tour of works at Cardiff, he caught a chill and returned to London, half-paralysed, where he lay dying for some three weeks. Among his last visitors were Oscar Wilde and James Whistler. He was buried in the tomb he designed for his mother at West Norwood, London. On his death, John Starling Chapple, Burges's office manager and close associate for more than twenty years, wrote \\"a constant relationship ... with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe. Thank God his work will live and ... be the admiration of future students. I have hardly got to realize my lonely position yet. He was almost all the world to me.\\" Lady Bute, wife of his greatest patron, wrote, \\"Dear Burges, ugly Burges, who designed such lovely things – what a duck.\\" In Saint Fin Barre's, together with memorials to his mother and sister, there is a memorial plaque to Burges, designed by him, and erected by his father. It shows the King of Heaven presiding over the four apostles, who hold open the Word of God.

Answer:","output":"Based on the provided product review, it is clear that the reviewer is depicting the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with the title \\"total disappointment :(\\" and continues to describe their negative experiences with the product throughout the review. There are several reasons that contribute to this unflattering portrayal: 1. The reviewer mentions that they have bought three of these battery packs for the GBA SP, which demonstrates that they have made multiple attempts to acquire a functioning product. Despite these attempts, their experience has remained consistently negative, which could indicate deficiencies in product quality or reliability. 2. The reviewer notes that the battery packs hold their charge but fail to transfer the charge to the device they were designed for. This highlights a significant functional issue, as the core purpose of a battery pack is to provide power and extend the life of the electronic device it was designed for. 3. The reviewer specifies that the battery packs were new in the package, which implies that the issue is not a result of improper handling or storage prior to purchase but rather an inherent product flaw. This further contributes to the unflattering representation of the product because it suggests that the problems experienced by the reviewer may be pervasive and not easily resolved. 4. The reviewer strongly advises against purchasing the product, stating \\"Don't buy these, they just don't work.\\" This recommendation discourages potential customers from considering the product, reflecting the reviewer's lack of confidence in the product's ability to perform as intended. In conclusion, the provided product review paints an unflattering picture of the product due to multiple instances of the battery packs not working, functional issues with the product design, and the potential for these problems to affect other customers.

The reason for this restatement is due to the company having incorrectly calculated loan losses during those periods. As a result of this restatement, SunTrust has decided to postpone the release of its earnings report. Restating financial results is not an uncommon practice among businesses, but it is a significant event that can have implications on the company's perceived credibility and the confidence of its investors. The fact that SunTrust incorrectly calculated their loan losses could indicate deficiencies in their financial reporting or internal controls, which can be a cause for concern among stakeholders. Loan losses are an essential aspect of a bank's financial performance as they can impact the organization's profitability, risk management, and regulatory standing. Incorrect calculation of loan losses can lead to a misrepresentation of the bank's financial health, possibly influencing the decisions of investors, analysts, and regulators. This misrepresentation could result in adverse consequences on the bank's overall value and reputation. By postponing the release of its earnings report, SunTrust is taking the necessary time to review and correct the inaccuracies in their reported loan losses. This action can be viewed as a responsible and transparent move aimed at ensuring the bank's stakeholders have access to accurate and reliable financial information.

Emphasize any of your specializations and areas of focus. Social media is a great way to build your brand and your business. You can put your relationship coaching business on different social media sites to help build network and professional connections. You can use Facebook and Twitter to help get the word out about your new business. Encourage friends, family, and acquaintances to share your page and spread the word about the services you offer.

Meeting other people in the field can help you make professional connections and potentially grow your business. You may also find out about professional development opportunities, relationship coaching events, and other opportunities through these sites. You should also try to get your name listed on relationship coaching websites. Look for national directories you can place your name so potential clients in your area can search for you. You set the amount you charge for each session. Sessions can range from 60 to 150 for a session. The amount you choose to charge may depend on various circumstances. At first, you may not want to charge too much since you are a new relationship coach who is trying to build a client list. If you are providing coaching to single people, you may choose to charge less than couples or families. The amount you charge may depend on the length of the session. Some sessions may run 45 minutes while others might last for 90 minutes. You may decide to charge more for longer sessions. To start a career in relationship coaching, you have to take on clients. Don’t get discouraged if it takes a few weeks or months to get your business off the ground. Keep advertising on social media and placing your name on relationship coaching directories. Once you start building a client list, decide how many clients you want to take on at once. You may want to focus on a few people at first, or try to get a full-time load. If you are struggling to gain new clients at first, offer reduced rates to your family and friends. Try offering reduced rates for new clients or the first ten clients who sign up for coaching sessions. You may decide to offer a free introductory session. This gives someone the option of meeting and talking with you to decide if you are a good fit. This might be good for people who are hesitant to spend money to find a relationship coach they may not like or if they are nervous because you are new to the field.","output":"The article highlights the importance of effectively marketing oneself as a relationship coach by creating a website, showcasing qualifications, leveraging social media for brand building, connecting with fellow coaches, listing on coaching directories, setting session rates, and offering special promotions to attract clients in the initial phase of business growth."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Clinic counselor Dr. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to a uniquely persuasive method: every time Dick smokes a cigarette, horrors of increasing magnitude will befall his wife and child. Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him). Not wanting to worry them, Dick hides the looming threat from his family. That night, Dick is angered by the methods Quitters uses and notices an undisposed pack of cigarettes in his desk. He prepares to smoke it, but notices a set of feet in his closet, realizing Quitters Inc. is serious about their threat to ensure he is not smoking. The following day, Dick visits his daughter (also played by Drew Barrymore) and gives her a doll. Donatti is also at the school, warning Dick that if he strays the only thing his daughter would understand is that someone is hurting her because her father misbehaved.

Movie title: The Final Cut Movie plot: In this futuristic tale, Alan Hakman (Robin Williams) witnesses the death of his childhood friend who had fallen off a plank of wood in the abandoned building in which they were playing. Flash to the present, and chips called \\"Zoe\\" are inserted into the brain at birth and record a person's entire life; when the person dies, the video is edited and shown at the funeral. Video editor (\\"cutter\\") Alan Hakman edits the recordings of people's lives according to the wishes of the subject's family, interviewing the person's family members to get an idea of what to look for in the recordings. Of course, in the case of some unscrupulous people, the bad parts are left out, but the entire recording of a person's life is therefore subject to scrutiny. So, in some cases, Hakman was knowingly burying the bad and highlighting the good. As a result, Alan is turned into a cold megalomaniac, but things change when he stumbles across a subject's memory of his friend, who he thought was dead. In searching for a record of his friend's Zoe chip, he finds none, as only 20% of all people have the implants. What he does find is a record of his own implant, of which he was unaware. He goes about accessing the memory, which shows that Alan's friend was still breathing, and the \\"blood\\" Alan thought he remembered stepping in as he was leaving the building turned out to be paint. Meantime, the Zoe chip of his subject is destroyed during a confrontation in his office. Confronted by activists who want his subject's life opened to all, Alan attempts to flee because his memory chip recorded what he saw of the subject's life, but is shot and killed by the activist, who justifies his actions, hence Alan was not killed in vain.

The dramatic revelation came Monday during a court hearing in New York where lawyers for Cohen and Trump argued for permission to determine whether thousands of pages of documents FBI agents seized from Cohen last week should be subject to attorney-client privilege. U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood appeared to reject the idea, saying that a “taint team” created by prosecutors to set aside privileged documents is a “viable option,” while a court-appointed outside lawyer known as a “special master” may also play a role in determining which records can and cannot be viewed by prosecutors. The disclosure about Hannity, who also hosts a nationally syndicated talk radio show, came after prosecutors indicated that Cohen performed “little to no legal work” and had just one client: Trump. In response, Cohen’s lawyers said that Cohen has represented three clients in the past year — Trump, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and a third “publicly prominent individual” who wished to remain anonymous. Cohen's lawyers identified Hannity as the third unnamed client only after Judge Wood ruled that it must be made public. In a statement, Hannity sought to minimize his relationship with Cohen, saying he had never retained him as a lawyer. “Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter,” Hannity said. “I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.\\" “I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third-party,” Hannity said.

While it is true that this period is sometimes called the Dark Age of Comic Books due to the popularity and artistic influence of grim titles like \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" and \\"Watchmen,\\" it is important to note that the Modern Age encompasses a broader range of styles, themes, and storytelling techniques.

Possible answers: wanted to show Quinn a good time, wanted to stay home, buy everyone a round Answer:","output":"Skylar took Quinn to the new bar to celebrate Quinn getting the new job for a few reasons. The primary reason being that Skylar wanted to show Quinn a good time and congratulate them on their recent achievement. By taking Quinn to a new bar, Skylar hoped to create a memorable experience that both of them could share and enjoy. Firstly, going to the new bar was a way for Skylar to demonstrate support and excitement over Quinn's new job. Skylar believes that accomplishments like these deserve recognition, so they used this opportunity as a chance to highlight Quinn's success. In doing so, Skylar seeks to strengthen their friendship by demonstrating that they are not just there for the difficult times, but also for celebrating the happy moments together. Secondly, taking Quinn to the new bar provided a chance for both of them to unwind and have fun together. Given the nature of a bar, it's a social environment that encourages enjoyment and relaxation. It is likely that Quinn had been working hard and going through the rigors of job searching, so Skylar deemed it necessary to organize an evening to help Quinn de-stress and savor their accomplishment. Another potential reason for this outing could be to expose Quinn to new experiences and places. Trying out a new bar can be refreshing and interesting as it gives the attendees an opportunity to explore a different atmosphere, taste new drinks and potentially make new connections. It's both an act of celebration and the embracing of the excitement that comes with new discoveries and shared experiences. In addition, by taking Quinn to a bar, Skylar could also have been providing an opportunity for them to meet other people and engage in conversation with other individuals who might be acquaintances, potential friends or professional connections. Attending social events can prove beneficial in expanding one's circle and even fostering connections that could be beneficial later on. It's important to note that the other options mentioned are not relevant to the scenario. Wanting to stay home may be a preference for Skylar, but considering the context, it would not be consistent with the goal of celebrating Quinn's achievement. Similarly, buying everyone a round might be a generous gesture, but it does not directly contribute to the reason behind Skylar choosing to take Quinn to the new bar. In conclusion, Skylar took Quinn to the new bar to celebrate their new job primarily to show Quinn a good time as well as to express support, facilitate relaxation, offer exposure to new experiences, and potentially foster networking opportunities. The outing served as a perfect way to acknowledge and appreciate Quinn's accomplishment within a fun and enjoyable environment."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music.

The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound. - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication.

FLYBOL is an acronym that seemingly has no clear meaning or reference to a known phenomenon or organization. Nevertheless, I will provide a detailed and long answer about left empty dwellings by region, rooms, use, and residence time in the housing. 1. Left Empty Dwellings by Region: Empty dwellings are properties that are unoccupied for a certain period. The reasons behind this could be many, such as the owner moving out temporarily or permanently, the property being under maintenance, or the property being on the market but not occupied yet. Different regions can have varying numbers of left empty dwellings due to factors like population density, economic conditions, and housing demand. Urban regions usually have a higher number of empty dwellings compared to rural areas, as the demand for accommodation in cities is generally higher. Furthermore, areas with a stagnant or declining population may also have more empty dwellings, as the supply of houses might exceed the demand. 2. Rooms: The number of rooms in an empty dwelling plays a crucial role in its occupancy time. Generally, accommodations with more rooms might take longer to be occupied, as larger homes have higher rent and purchase prices. Similarly, properties with too few rooms might also remain empty for longer periods, as they may not meet the space requirements of potential occupants. 3. Use: The intended use of an empty dwelling also affects its occupancy duration. For example, properties meant for residential purposes might be occupied faster than those intended for commercial or industrial use. This is because the demand for residential properties is more consistent, while commercial or industrial properties are often subject to market fluctuations. Additionally, properties used for vacation rentals might experience seasonal changes in occupancy rates. 4. Residence Time in the Housing: Residence time refers to the duration an occupant spends in a particular property. In the context of empty dwellings, this concept is significant because it affects the overall number of empty properties in a region. Areas with a high residential turnover rate or temporary residents, such as college towns or tourist destinations, are likely to have a higher number of left empty dwellings. In contrast, areas with stable populations and long-term residents might have fewer empty dwellings. In conclusion, left empty dwellings are influenced by various factors like region, room count, intended property use, and the residence time of occupants. Analyzing these factors can provide useful insights into housing market trends, identifying potential housing deficits, and developing strategies to reduce vacancy rates."},{"instruction":"Translate to Russian: The guest reviews are submitted by our customers after their stay at Euston Square Hotel .

Let's analyze each sentence's content and context. Sentence 1: \\"So it just doesn't hold water, and you look at some of the other countries that have the death penalty.\\" This sentence implies that the speaker believes the death penalty is not a valid or logical solution (i.e., \\"it doesn't hold water\\"). Additionally, it suggests that there are other countries where the death penalty is practiced which either the speaker or the listener is comparing to the current subject. Sentence 2: \\"In other countries, they handle the death penalty much more justly.\\" The second sentence asserts that the death penalty is handled more justly in other countries. This implies that there are differences between the mentioned countries and the one the speaker is currently discussing, but it does not directly entail what those differences might be or whether the speaker approves of the death penalty use in those other countries. In conclusion, the second sentence is not directly entailed by the first sentence, as the first sentence talks about the lack of validity of the death penalty (in the speaker's opinion) and alludes to comparisons with other countries but does not directly address the concept of justice as the second sentence does. However, both sentences discuss the death penalty and other countries' practices, making them related to the same topic.

NATO, a political and military alliance formed in response to the security concerns that arose in the aftermath of World War II, has been trying to ensure the stability and security of its member states. Russia, being a major global power with its military might and regional influence, has a significant bearing on NATO's decisions and efforts to maintain peace in Europe and other regions. Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary General, in a bid to reduce tensions and foster a stable and secure environment, has emphasized the need for establishing a mature relationship with Russia. This call comes at a time when both NATO and Russia are faced with emerging challenges, such as cyber threats, geopolitical shifts, and the growing influence of non-state actors. A mature relationship between the two entities would require abandoning the historical animosity that has impeded cooperation and mutual understanding in the past. A mature relationship between NATO and Russia would entail respectful dialogue, a willingness to see each other's point of view, and maintaining open communication channels. It would also involve replacing Cold War-era hostility with a cooperative approach to address contemporary issues, such as counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, and non-proliferation. For NATO, improving its relationship with Russia entails demonstrating its commitment to the mutual resolution of conflicts and taking concrete steps to address Russia's security concerns. Building trust with Moscow could result in Russia re-examining its perspective on NATO’s eastward expansion, missile defense systems, and other strategic moves – issues that have been sources of contention between the two parties. Simultaneously, NATO needs to continue upholding its commitment to the security of its member states and ensuring that they are not subject to undue pressure or intimidation from any external forces, including Russia. On the Russian side, demonstrating a genuine willingness to engage in meaningful dialogue and be open to compromise will be crucial in building a mature relationship with NATO. Russia needs to demonstrate its commitment to adhering to the principles of international law, respecting the sovereignty of other nations, and avoiding any kind of aggression. This would lay the groundwork for constructive and effective collaboration between NATO and Russia, which could extend to various areas of mutual interest including peacekeeping operations, humanitarian efforts, and crisis management. Apart from addressing bilateral concerns, a mature relationship between NATO and Russia is essential for global peace and security. With the unpredictable nature of current geopolitical dynamics, any escalation of tensions between the two entities could have unforeseen consequences, leading to a renewed arms race, proxy wars, and heightened destabilization. In the long term, fostering a stable and constructive relationship between NATO and Russia could pave the way for arms control agreements, cooperative military exercises, and joint initiatives that enhance global security. In conclusion, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's call for a mature relationship with Russia should be considered as an opportunity for both parties to take a step back, reassess their priorities, and work together in the interest of regional and global stability. Pursuing a mutually beneficial relationship would not only alleviate security concerns of both sides but also contribute to easing tensions on the world stage. It is high time that the two entities embrace the spirit of cooperation and leave the animosities of the past behind in order to build a prosperous and secure future for all."},{"instruction":"Consider, aşadar, că animalele ar trebui ucise doar în cadrul controlat al unor abatoare autorizate şi supuse inspecţiilor şi, fără excepţie, după asomare prealabilă.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

My boyfriend and I decided to try out Miller's after seeing all the ads for their specials around Town Square. We ended up going on Valentine's Day, and they had a special menu, but we didn't try anything off of it. I read about their famous \\"Zingers\\" here on Yelp so we ordered some hot Zingers and a dozen oysters to start. The Zingers were really great and went well with the beer -would definitely recommend! The oysters were pretty much what you can expect from a \\"bar-food\\" type place like this. They were 14 for a dozen, and I don't think I would order them again. I can get a dozen for around the same price fresh at Whole Foods down the street and they taste much better. My boyfriend ordered a few beers with the meal. It looks like they had a full bar, and the selection on the menu was decent. For entrees, I ordered the 35 Shrimp Scampi and he ordered the Chicken Caesar. Both were very good - and I think my pasta actually had 35 shrimp in it! I thought that was just the name. The portion sizes are huge: I ate about half of mine and I still had enough pasta left for a meal, and the salad was very large as well. I only took a few bites of the salad but each bite had a good amount of dressing, unlike those salads where the dressing is skimp. Neither of us finished our food and we were too full for dessert. The bill came out to be about 70, but that is only because of the beers - without them I think it would have been around 50. I would probably go back to Miller's on those days when you are having that \\"What do you want to eat?.. I don't know... What do you want to eat?\\" conversation. Its a pretty chill place with decent service, food, and atmosphere. Choose the sentiment of this review? Choose your answer from: --negative. --positive.","output":"The correct answer is: --positive. This review is positive because the person enjoyed their experience at Miller's, liked the Zingers, appreciated the large portion sizes, and the overall decent service, food, and atmosphere. They also got a carnation for Valentine's Day, which added to their positive experience.

During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \\"the Singing Budgie\\" by her detractors over the coming years. In a review of the album Kylie for AllMusic, Chris True described the tunes as \\"standard, late-80s ... bubblegum\\", but added, \\"her cuteness makes these... Answer:","output":"The singer who was going to work with the producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman is Kylie Minogue. Minogue had risen to fame previously as an actress on the television show \\"Neighbours\\", but it was her musical performance at the Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert that caught the attention of Mushroom Records. Subsequently, she was signed to the said label in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion,\\" proved to be a major success in her home country of Australia, spending seven weeks at number one on the singles charts. Due to this initial success, Minogue was sent to England by Gary Ashley, an executive from Mushroom Records, to work with the renowned producing trio Stock, Aitken & Waterman. Her time working with them led to the creation of her hit, \\"I Should Be So Lucky,\\" a song that was written while she was waiting outside of the studio as the producers had forgotten about her appointment. Despite this almost comedic oversight, the song was a major success, reaching number one in several countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Israel, which further established her as a prominent figure in the music industry. In July 1988, her debut album, \\"Kylie,\\" was released which was essentially a collection of dance-oriented pop music. The album had a long run on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. It also did well in the United States, where it went gold. To further her music career, Minogue left the show \\"Neighbours\\" later that same year. Her collaboration with Jason Donovan on the song \\"Especially for You\\" became yet another number-one hit in the UK and eventually sold its one millionth copy in December 2014. Despite facing some criticism early on with some detractors labeling her as \\"the singing budgie,\\" Minogue's successful collaborations with Stock, Aitken & Waterman proved pivotal in her striving music career."},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which documentary film is older, Superjews or Feiyu Show?

The puppeteer uses movements of her hands, arms, or control devices such as rods or strings to move the body, head, limbs, and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet. The puppeteer often speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet, and then synchronizes the movements of the puppet's mouth with this spoken part. The actions, gestures and spoken parts acted out by the puppeteer with the puppet are typically used in storytelling. Puppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which dates back to the 5th century BC in Ancient Greece. There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made from a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They range from very simple in construction and operation to very complex. - Looney Tunes is an American animated series of comedy short films produced by Warner Bros. from 1930 to 1969 during the golden age of American animation, alongside its sister series \\"Merrie Melodies\\".

Step 2: \\"sign up\\" instead of \\"signup\\": When used as a verb in English, \\"sign up\\" is two separate words. \\"Signup\\" is a noun or adjective referring to the act or instance of signing up. Step 3: Commas are added between the elements in the list \\"quality, themes, and payouts\\" to make the sentence clearer. This is commonly known as the Oxford comma or serial comma and is used to separate items in a list. This comma is optional and some style guidelines recommend not using it, but it often can help avoid ambiguity."},{"instruction":"TEXT: benjy gripped my hand , and i squeezed back , trying to reassure him . \`\` knox said i could . if you have a problem with it , take it up with him .

Does the word \\"beachhead\\" mean the same thing in \\"The Germans were desperately trying to contain the Anzio beachhead.\\" and \\"The town became a beachhead in the campaign to ban smoking outdoors.\\"? Choose from: +different meanings. +the same meaning.","output":"The word \\"beachhead\\" in both sentences does not have the exact same meaning, but they share a similar concept. So, the answer would be: +different meanings. In the first sentence, \\"The Germans were desperately trying to contain the Anzio beachhead,\\" the term \\"beachhead\\" is used in its traditional military sense. In a military context, a beachhead refers to a strategically important area, usually on a shoreline, that an invading force has successfully captured and is now using as a secure starting point to continue advancing into enemy territory. In this instance, Anzio is the location where the invading forces landed and established their foothold during World War II. It represents a more literal interpretation of the term. In contrast, the second sentence, \\"The town became a beachhead in the campaign to ban smoking outdoors,\\" employs \\"beachhead\\" in a more metaphorical sense. While it still implies an initial foothold, it does not refer to a physical location or military operation. Instead, the term is used to describe the starting point of a broader effort or campaign, in this case, the campaign to ban smoking outdoors. The town serves as an example for other areas to potentially follow suit and join the movement. This usage of \\"beachhead\\" is more abstract, leveraging the military concept to describe the advancement of an idea or initiative. In summary, although the word \\"beachhead\\" is used in different contexts in these two sentences, the essence of the term remains the same: it signifies a foothold, whether literal or metaphorical, from which further progress can be made."},{"instruction":"A neighborhood association decided to plant a tree on every street.

They want every other tree to be a fruit tree, so they will plant 9 fruit trees in total (18/2 = 9). The association wants an equal number of plum, pear, and apricot trees.

The judge made a ruling related to this situation, which indicates that the answer involves a financial aspect. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant choices - \\"selling out\\" refers to compromising one's principles for personal gain, which does not apply to this situation. - \\"hitting the jackpot\\" implies winning in gambling or having good luck, but it does not directly relate to the judicial ruling in the question. - \\"happy\\" is not focused on the specific financial aspect mentioned in the question. - \\"getting paid\\" is close to the correct answer, but it implies that the person is being paid for work or services. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate answer \\"Receiving money\\" is the best answer because it describes a person getting money after an accident, which is in-line with the judge's ruling.

The spread of water-carried disease is of great concern. In highly developed countries in particular, emphasis has changed from concern over bacterial disease to concern over water-carried viral disease. Viral hepatitis , for example, has been found to occur more frequently in cities whose water supplies have comparatively high levels of water impurity. Poisonous chemicals found in streams that are ultimately used for water supplies also create an important public health problem. It is clear that poisonous chemicals must be excluded from water, but more and more chemicals from new pesticides , fertilizers, and other new products have been found in water. Since the public health importance of these chemicals is not yet fully known, they are of increasing concern. The chemicals from fertilizers are also finding their way into water supplies from pollution. As man's desire for water-based recreation increases, greater demands are placed on the quality of the water. The water must not only but be attractive in appearance but also meet certain other conditions. Sports such as swimming involve direct contact with water, and so water standards are raised higher. The range of water quality necessary for industrial processes varies greatly with the intended use of the water. The water used in steel mills, foe example, must have a lower chloride level than that accepted for drinking water. Cooling water can often be of comparatively low sanitary quality.

Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story. And a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. To sum up, you should write the second sentence of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the new ending(last three sentences) of the story.

Original Ending: When I asked her why she didn't want to replace the table she smiled. Then she told me about every scratch and how it got there. I never knew my Mom was so sentimental.

According to jazz critic Gary Giddins, Misterioso is a hard bop record. The songs performed for the album were arranged by Monk, who reworked four of his earlier compositions. In the album's liner notes, Keepnews wrote of Monk's approach to arrangements: \\"It should be axiomatic that Monk is a constantly self-renewing composer-arranger-musician, that each new recording of an 'old' number, particularly with different personnel, represents a fresh view of it—almost a new composition.\\" In the producer's opinion, Monk played the piano more vividly and less introspectively than on his studio recordings in response to the enthusiastic crowds he drew nightly to the venue.On \\"Nutty\\", Griffin incorporated lines from \\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\\" and exhibited a frenetic swing that was complemented by counterplay from Haynes and Monk. \\"Blues Five Spot\\", a new composition by Monk for the album, is a twelve-bar blues homage to the Five Spot Café and featured solos from each player. Griffin and Monk transfigured chord structures and melodies throughout the performance. Griffin's solo vamp maintained the rhythm while quoting lines from other pieces, including the theme song for the animated Popeye theatrical shorts; he played \\"The Sailor's Hornpipe\\" at the end of \\"Blues Five Spot\\". The quartet began \\"In Walked Bud\\" with an eight-bar piano intro and thirty-two-bar form. Griffin began his solo a minute into the song with saxophone wails. In the third minute, Monk did not play, while Griffin played fast phrases at the top of his register with intermittently slower R&B and free jazz elements. Monk shouted approvingly throughout Griffin's solo before he resumed piano and played a two-minute theme. \\"Just a Gigolo\\", a standard, was the only song on the album not composed by Monk, who performed it in a brief, unaccompanied version. It was played as a single chorus repeated at length.The title track—first recorded for Blue Note Records in 1948 with vibraphonist Milt Jackson—is one of Monk's most influential recordings and is...

He is best known as a member of the bluegrass ensemble the Kentucky Colonels and the rock band the Byrds, as well as for being a pioneer of the musical genre of country rock during the late 1960s. White also worked extensively as a session musician, appearing on recordings by the Everly Brothers, Joe Cocker, Ricky Nelson, Pat Boone, the Monkees, Randy Newman, Gene Clark, Linda Ronstadt, Arlo Guthrie, and Jackson Browne amongst others. Together with frequent collaborator Gene Parsons, he invented the B-Bender, a guitar accessory that enables a player to mechanically bend the B-string up a whole tone and emulate the sound of a pedal steel guitar. Context: During 1964, White began to look beyond bluegrass music towards rock 'n' roll as an avenue for artistic expression. Although he was influenced by Country guitarists like Doc Watson, Don Reno and Joe Maphis, he also idolized the playing of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, rock 'n' roller Chuck Berry, and studio musician James Burton. White even anticipated the viability of a folk/rock hybrid when, in the summer of 1964, he was approached by Jim Dickson to record a version of the then-unreleased Bob Dylan song \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" with electric instruments. However, despite White's enthusiasm for the project, he was unable to convince his bandmates in the Kentucky Colonels of the experiment's validity and ultimately, the song was instead recorded by Dickson's proteges, the Byrds. By the time the original line-up of the Kentucky Colonels folded in late 1965, White had become a respected and well-known guitarist. Abandoning bluegrass temporarily, he switched from his Martin D-28 acoustic guitar to an electric Fender Telecaster, with the intention of becoming a studio musician like his hero James Burton. Transitioning to electric guitar required White to modify his right hand playing technique, switch from open chording to fretting the whole guitar neck with his left hand, and practice using the tone and volume controls. However, he soon mastered the intricacies of the instrument and, between 1965 and 1968, he undertook session work for artists including Ricky Nelson, the Monkees, and the Gosdin Brothers. As 1965 turned into 1966, White met Gene Parsons and Gib Guilbeau at a recording session for the Gosdin Brothers and shortly after, he began to perform live with the duo in local California clubs, as well as doing regular session work on their records, which were released under the moniker of Cajun Gib and Gene. 1966 also saw White begin playing with a country group called Trio, which featured drummer Bart Haney and former Kentucky Colonel, Roger Bush, on bass. In autumn of that year, as a result of his friendship with Gilbeau, Parsons and the Gosdin Brothers, White was asked to provide lead guitar to ex-Byrd Gene Clark's debut solo album, Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers. White also briefly joined Clark's touring band shortly thereafter. During the Clark album sessions, White reconnected with mandolin player and bassist Chris Hillman, who he had known during the early 1960s as a member of the bluegrass combo the Hillmen. Hillman was currently a member of the Byrds and in December 1966, he invited White to contribute countrified lead guitar playing to his songs \\"Time Between\\" and \\"The Girl with no Name\\", which both appeared on the Byrds' Younger Than Yesterday album. The country-oriented nature of the songs was something of a stylistic departure for the group and can be seen as an early indicator of the experimentation with country music that would color the Byrds' subsequent work. White also contributed guitar to the band's follow-up album, The Notorious Byrd Brothers, and to their seminal 1968 country rock release, Sweetheart of the Rodeo. Question: Any other songs during this time? Answer:","output":"Yes, during this time, Clarence White continued to contribute his guitar skills to various songs and albums. In addition to his work with the Byrds, White performed on numerous records as a session musician, although specific song titles from this period are not readily available. However, his collaborations with artists such as the Everly Brothers, Joe Cocker, Ricky Nelson, Pat Boone, the Monkees, Randy Newman, Gene Clark, Linda Ronstadt, Arlo Guthrie, and Jackson Browne during his career highlight the diversity of his musical contributions during this time."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Xbox 360 is a home video game console developed by Microsoft.

This woman may be equipped with professional skills and perhaps valuable experience. She will not be content to be Executive Assistant to Mr. Seldom Seen of the Assistant Vice President's Girl Friday, who is the only one who comes in on Saturday. She is the symbol of what I call the Second Wave of Feminism. She is the modern woman who is determined to be. Her forerunner was the radical feminist who interpreted her trapped position as a female as oppression by the master class of men. Men, she believed, had created a domestic, servile role for women in order that men could have the career and the opportunity to participate in making the great decisions of society. Thus the radical feminist held that women through history had been oppressed and dehumanized, mainly because man chose to exploit his wife and the mother of his children. Sometimes it was deliberate exploitation and sometimes it was the innocence of never looking beneath the pretensions of life. The radical feminists found strength in banding together. Coming to recognize each other for the first time, they could explore their own identities, realize their own power, and view the male and his system as the common enemy. The first phases of feminism in the last five years often took on this militant, class-warfare tone. Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, and many others hammered home their ideas with a persistence that aroused and intrigued many of the brightest and most able women in the country. Consciousness-raising groups allowed women to explore both their identities and their dreams--and the two were often found in direct conflict. What is the stereotyped role of American women?

Context: One student started packing up at the beginning of a lab exercise. I asked him where he was going. He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime. You already know that. You can email me. It’s my job to help you understand, but you have to come to me. You are an adult. It would be very inappropriate of me to follow you around, inviting you to office hours. And you must do the homework and the labs.” He stayed for the lab. I notified his counselor about what was going on, and she called him in and said the same things that I said. Next class he moved from the seat at the edge of my peripheral vision, to the middle, started working his ass off, and he passed. For a while I thought he was closing in on a C, but he got his D and graduated. And I didn’t give him anymore of a grading break than I give any of my students.

Over the years, he collected six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, and the coveted UEFA Champions League trophy while playing for the Red Devils. His move to Real Madrid in 2003 only served to enhance his global appeal and strengthen his brand. Not only was he an integral part of the famed \\"Galácticos,\\" alongside Ronaldo, Zidane, and Figo, but he also aided in securing the 2006-2007 La Liga title for Los Blancos. Beckham then ventured across the Atlantic to join MLS side, LA Galaxy, where his impact on American soccer was immense. Despite facing initial struggles, he eventually led the team to back-to-back MLS Cups in 2011 and 2012. Throughout his career, Beckham created various highlight-worthy moments both on and off the pitch. Most notably, his spectacular goals - including his famous halfway line goal for Manchester United against Wimbledon - not only showcased his immense talent but also etched his name in football history. In addition to his club success, David Beckham had a storied international career where he earned 115 caps for England and represented his country in three World Cups.

Shaking the object is definitely not encouraged. But that’s exactly what we—a group of museum curators and conservators—did when this exquisite Greek black-glazed kantharos (wine cup) was temporarily removed from display during the reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Getty Villa. One of just a handful of “rattling cups” that survive from the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., we wanted to learn more about how it was made.(1) Although we were eager to find out what was below the surface of the cup, we started by examining its exterior. The kantharos’s distinctive shape, with profiled lip, tall foot, and elegant, upward-sweeping handles, is characteristic of black-glazed pottery made in the second half of the fourth century B.C., and replicates the form of luxury vessels in metal. Although the cup is currently catalogued as South Italian, the shape—and its striking decoration—are also typical of Athenian manufacture, and it may in fact have been produced there.(2) During the fourth century B.C., Athenian pottery was both imported into southern Italy and imitated by local craftsmen. The best South Italian versions were meant to be difficult to distinguish from Athenian examples, and we are continuing to investigate where ours may have been made. A Greek inscription applied in gilt around the rim reads: ΚΑΣΤΟΡΠΟΛΥΔΕΥΙΚΕΣ (“KASTORPOLYDEUIKES”). Kastor and Polydeukes were twin sons of Zeus—known together as the Dioskouroi—and were worshipped as protectors of sailors, horsemen, and chariot racing.(3) The inscription indicates that the kantharos was dedicated to them, perhaps as thanks for—or in hope of—safe passage at sea or a successful race.

It was called single in IEEE 754-1985. In older computers, different floating-point formats of 4 bytes were used, e.g., GW-BASIC's single-precision data type was the 32-bit MBF floating-point format. Ieee single precision floating point number in binary? If the answer is 'binary32'; explain the reasoning:","output":"Yes, the IEEE single precision floating point number in binary is referred to as 'binary32' in IEEE 754-2008 standard. The reasoning behind this is as follows: IEEE 754-2008 is a standard for floating-point arithmetic that was established by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). This standard defines representation and operations for floating-point numbers. 'binary32', as the name suggests, is a 32-bit base-2 format (binary representation) for floating-point numbers that complies with this standard. In the binary32 format, a single precision floating-point number is represented using 32 bits, which are divided into three parts: 1. Sign bit (1 bit): The first bit indicates the sign of the number, where 0 represents a positive number and 1 represents a negative number. 2. Exponent (8 bits): The next 8 bits are used to store the exponent (E) of the number, which is represented in excess 127 (bias 127) format. This means that you need to subtract 127 from the stored exponent to get the actual exponent. 3. Mantissa (23 bits): The last 23 bits are used to store the significant digits (also called mantissa or fraction) of the number in the format 1.xxxx... (known as normalized form). Note that the leading 1 is implicit and not stored within the bits. The floating-point number is then calculated using this formula: (-1)^sign * 2^(E - 127) * (1 + mantissa). In older computers, various other floating-point formats were used. However, IEEE 754-2008's binary32 format has become the standard, as it is widely used in modern hardware and software for its efficient representation and arithmetic operations with single precision floating-point numbers."},{"instruction":"If asked her if she enjoyed her job, can we conclude that \\"I asked if this was her favorite job.\\"?

Asking if someone enjoys their job refers to whether they find their current position satisfying, engaging, and fulfilling. It seeks to understand if they are content with the work they do, its challenges, environment, and how it aligns with their goals or values. On the other hand, asking if it is someone's favorite job might require a comparison with previous or other jobs held by the individual. It seeks to understand the personal ranking of their current job compared to other work experiences they have had. Their favorite job may be the one they find most enjoyable and satisfying, surpassing other jobs they have held in the past.

He is charged with murdering sex worker Ting Fang, 25, whose body was found in a room at the Grand Chancellor Hotel in the city centre. Scroll down for video. Ting Fang, 25, was found murdered in an Adelaide city hotel room with a slashed neck on New Year's Day. Chungaung Piao, 27, of Allenby Gardens, appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates Court two days after he was arrested. He has been charged with Fang's murder. Ms Fang was found deceased in the hotel room with her neck slashed open. The court heard that, 'there was an extremely serious injury to (Ms Fang's) neck, both her (internal and external) jugular veins were cut,' she said. Police at the time said she had been in Adelaide for three or four days. It's understood she was working as a sex worker. Prosecutor Lucy Boord alleged that Piao's fingerprint was found on the victim's shoe, according to the Adelaide Advertiser. Defence lawyer Julian Kelly said Piao denied involvement in the murder. Police at the time said she had been in Adelaide for three or four days. It's understood she was working as a sex worker. Ms Fang was found deceased in the Hotel Grand Chancellor Hotel when the hallway and the level below her twelfth-floor apartment began to flood. A tap was running in the room where she'd been killed.

We are asking Apple to take the vicious guard dog away and let us pick the lock,” said FBI Director Comey in his recent testimony before the Judiciary Committee. What would happen if the government mandated that we take away all the guard dogs in a neighborhoods and leave our homes vulnerable for others to ‘pick the lock’ and gain access to our homes? As a former judge I have a problem with that premise. As the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Terrorism, I am as dedicated as anyone to national security and the mission of defeating the terrorists. I still believe that we can combat this threat without bending the rules written in the Constitution. The question is this: Must private industry be forced to create new software that can give the government access to a phone they would not have access to otherwise? I think the answer is no. The truth is that Congress should have acted on this issue already and not waited for a terrorist attack. Hundreds of phones in the possession of investigators are sitting in limbo because the law is not clear. This will turn into thousands unless we act. It is the role of Congress to debate this and to change the policy, not the courts. Since the San Bernardino attack, investigators have not been able to get into the phone of Syed Farook because of the security Apple has on all of its devices. In the wake of San Bernardino, law enforcement jobs are more challenging than ever as our enemies are more determined. As challenging as this is, a drastic, fear-driven policy that dramatically affects the privacy of every single American with an Apple product should not be made in the courts. Before we mandate that the government must have a “key” for all encrypted data-- we must step back and consider what that means for privacy. Congress has recently taken steps to protect the Fourth Amendment rights of Americans in the digital age; this decision does the opposite. This order in effect would give the government the keys to the backdoor to every cell phone in America. In order to do this, the government is attempting to force Apple and other companies to re-engineer all of their products in order to give the government the ability to access all phones. This decision will not only violate the privacy of American citizens -- far more than just the owner of the iPhone the court ruled on-- it will also hurt American tech companies. American products will suffer on the world market because international consumers will know that their phones are not safe from the eyes of the snooping United States government. My bill, H.R. 2233, End Warrantless Surveillance of ‎Americans Act would specifically prohibit the government from either mandating (as they are trying to do with Apple) or even requesting that a back door be installed. Congress should immediately act on this to make the law clear. Throughout history, America has faced threats from a variety of enemies. During times of heightened fear, there have been similar calls for less privacy in the name of more security. I believe there can be both. Today the government once again asks us to just “trust” them with our privacy because the threat of Islamic extremism exists. They want a key to our email, a key to our phones, a key to virtually all elements of our life. Should we trust the government not to abuse this power? We don’t give the government a spare key to our homes and our cars. Why should the laws that govern the digital world be any different? These questions are difficult, but they are not new. Technology has rapidly changed in recent years, and the question has been what will Congress do to protect privacy. The case of San Bernadino has demanded that we address that question. The law must keep up with technology. Our Constitutional rights depend on it. Technology may change, but the Constitution does not. The Electronic Communications and Privacy Act (ECPA) is a perfect example. Under this law, authorities can search your electronic communications after 180 days without a warrant. Today, with most of our data flowing through the cloud, our constitutional right to privacy is in jeopardy. Let’s not make the same mistake twice with encryption. We can defeat the threat of Islamic extremism while keeping our Constitution whole at the same time. As Ben Franklin once said: “Those who Sacrifice Liberty for Security Deserve Neither”.

They arrive in Rio to finalize the purchase of a hotel, but angry Claudia must fly to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to meet the hotel's owner. Claudia instructs Emily to cover her date for the night. While viewing the hotel, Emily sees two locals having animalistic sex, which unnerves her and she returns to her own hotel. She meets Claudia's date; a wealthy man named James Wheeler. They have dinner, accompanied by James' bodyguards. James intrigues Emily; he is quiet and asks personal questions without being demanding or rude. After dinner, they attend a street carnival; Emily leaves after a masked man who looks like James tries to seduce her. The next morning, Emily wakes to find James watching her. He gives her a bouquet of orchids and denies making advances to her the previous evening, and as an apology, he offers to show her the city. She is initially reluctant but consents; they attend a party with a married couple that they noticed in the restaurant the night before. Some navy sailors at the party try to make advances on the wife; James fights them and he, Emily, and the couple leave quickly in his limousine. The married couple is having marital problems because of the wife's infidelity. She wants to reconcile with her husband. James encourages the couple to have sex in the limo, which they do. Emily finds their actions disturbing. Emily and James then visit the hotel that her firm wants to buy, and she tells James that she fears he would disappear if she touched him. When Emily hugs James, he pulls away from her, telling her that he does not like to be touched.
