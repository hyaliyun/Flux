We have two terms containing the variable p, 3*p and -6*p. Combine them: (3 - 6)*p + 3 = 0 This simplifies to: -3*p + 3 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable p. To isolate p, we first move the constant term (3) to the other side of the equation: -3*p = -3 Next, divide both sides by -3 to solve for p: p = (-3) / (-3) Step 3: Calculate the value of p.

Gurumoorthy Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Gurumoorthy: The Mridangam Maestro\\" Genre: Drama/Musical Plot: Act 1: Prologue and Discovery The movie opens in the bustling city of Chennai, India, where an elderly man, Gurumoorthy, lives a simple life as an unassuming Mridangam teacher. Despite his immense talent, he never gained fame or recognition in the world of Carnatic music, having chosen instead to focus on his students and the purity of the art. Meanwhile, a young and ambitious documentary filmmaker, Tara, returns to India from the US. She comes across a recording of one of Gurumoorthy's performances from decades ago, and she is instantly captivated by his unique style and the soul-stirring rhythms he creates. Intrigued, she begins her research on the elusive Mridangam musician, only to discover that little is known about him in the present day. Act 2: Unearthing the Past Undeterred, Tara seeks out Gurumoorthy, who is initially skeptical of her intentions. Over time, she gains his trust, and he opens up to her about his past. Through flashbacks, we learn about Gurumoorthy's struggles as a child prodigy, the challenges he faced in honing his craft, and his ultimate decision to bow out of the competitive music scene. Along the way, we meet key figures from his past, including his strict guru, his supportive best friend, and his long-lost love, who had married another man due to societal pressures. Parallel to this, Tara documents Gurumoorthy's current life, showcasing his unwavering dedication to his students and his selfless efforts to preserve the ancient art of Mridangam. Slowly, she uncovers the reason behind his anonymity: a rivalry with a jealous contemporary, who had successfully sabotaged Gurumoorthy's career when they were both young musicians. Act 3: Redemption and Encore With Tara's help, Gurumoorthy confronts his rival and sets the record straight. The documentary she creates goes on to become widely acclaimed, and people are once again reminded of Gurumoorthy's genius. The once humble Mridangam teacher is now celebrated as a living legend, and he welcomes the attention, not for personal glory, but for the opportunity to spotlight the beauty of his art and the importance of preserving the tradition. As the film reaches its climax, Gurumoorthy is invited to perform at a prestigious music festival, sharing the stage with renowned artists from around the world. As he plays the Mridangam with unmatched mastery, the audience is entranced, and the applause reverberates throughout the concert hall. Epilogue: The movie closes with scenes of Gurumoorthy being recognized and celebrated by the local community. His past love, now a widow, watches his performance with pride, and they share a moment of closure. Meanwhile, his young students learn firsthand the power of resilience and dedication, and Gurumoorthy continues to nurture the next generation of Mridangam musicians. \\"Gurumoorthy: The Mridangam Maestro\\" is a heartwarming tale of one man's lifelong pursuit of artistic purity, shining a spotlight on the beauty and intricacies of Indian classical music, while delivering an inspiring message about the power of perseverance, forgiveness, and following one's passion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment.

In this image taken from video, U.S. citizen Matthew Todd Miller speaks at an undisclosed location in North Korea Friday, Aug. 1, 2014. Two Americans, Miller and Jeffrey Edward Fowle, charged with “anti-state”... (Associated Press)      In this image taken from video, U.S. citizen Jeffrey Edward Fowle speaks at an undisclosed location in North Korea Friday, Aug. 1, 2014. Two Americans, Fowle and Matthew Todd Miller, charged with “anti-state”... (Associated Press)      In their first appearance since being detained more than three months ago, Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Edward Fowle told a local AP Television News crew that they were in good health and were being treated well. They also said they were allowed to take daily walks. The brief meeting was conducted under the condition that the specific location not be disclosed.      Fowle said he fears his situation will get much worse once he goes on trial.      \\"The horizon for me is pretty dark,\\" he said. \\"I don't know what the worst-case scenario would be, but I need help to extricate myself from this situation. I ask the government for help in that regards.\\"      It was not clear whether they were speaking on their own initiative, or if their comments were coerced. The TV crew was permitted to ask them questions.      North Korea says the two committed hostile acts which violated their status as tourists. It has announced that authorities are preparing to bring them before a court, but has not yet specified what they did that was considered hostile or illegal, or what kind of punishment they might face. The date of the trial has not been announced.      Ri Tong II, a North Korean diplomat, declined to answer questions about the Americans at a news conference Friday at the United Nations. But when pressed in a follow-up question he said their cases were \\"legal issues\\" and they had \\"violated our law.\\"      Fowle arrived in North Korea on April 29. He is suspected of leaving a Bible in a nightclub in the northern port city of Chongjin, but a spokesman for Fowle's family said the 56-year-old from Miamisburg, Ohio, was not on a mission for his church. Fowle works in a city streets department. He has a wife and three children, ages 9, 10, and 12.      \\"The window is closing on that process. It will be coming relatively soon, maybe within a month,\\" Fowle said of his trial. \\"I'm anxious to get home, I'm sure all of us are.\\"      Fowle also produced a letter he said he had written summarizing his experience in North Korea.      The attorney for Fowle's family said Friday his wife hadn't seen the video, but had read news reports about his comments.      \\"I can tell you that she is very upset, as you can imagine,\\" said attorney Timothy Tepe. He said he and the family were still gathering information and likely would have a statement on Monday.      Less is known about Miller, or about what specific crime he allegedly committed.      North Korea's state-run media have said the 24-year-old entered the country April 10 with a tourist visa, but tore it up at the airport and shouted that he wanted to seek asylum. A large number of Western tourists visited Pyongyang in April to run in the annual Pyongyang Marathon or attend related events. Miller came at that time, but tour organizers say he was not planning to join the marathon.      \\"I expect soon I will be going to trial for my crime and be sent to prison,\\" Miller said. \\"I have been requesting help from the American government, but have received no reply.\\"      A handwritten note on the front door of his family's home in California asked for privacy.      Neighbor Carol Stewart said Miller first traveled to South Korea about four years ago to visit a brother stationed there with the U.S. Air Force. He found work teaching English and learned Korean, Stewart said in a July 1 interview. She has since declined to comment out of respect for his parents' wishes.      \\"He liked it a lot, and he's been there ever since,\\" said Stewart, describing Miller as the shy one of the four brothers.      North Korea has also been holding another American, Kenneth Bae, since November 2012.      Bae, a Korean-American missionary who turned 46 on Friday, told a Japan-based pro-North Korean news organization earlier this week that he felt \\"abandoned\\" by the U.S. government. He is serving a sentence of 15 years of hard labor for what North Korea has claimed were hostile acts against the state. However, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Thursday the agency is in regular contact with Bae's family.      Last summer, authorities moved Bae from a work camp to a hospital because of failing health and weight loss. He was sent back to the work camp earlier this year, only to be taken again to a hospital less than two months later. His family says he suffers from diabetes, an enlarged heart, liver problems and back pain.      Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said in a statement Thursday it was the first word the family has had of Bae since April.      \\"After months of silence, it is devastating to hear Kenneth talk about 'feeling abandoned by the United States government,'\\" she said. \\"Although we acknowledge and appreciate all the efforts the U.S. State Department has been making behind the scenes to secure Kenneth's release, the fact remains that after almost two years, Kenneth still remains imprisoned in North Korea.\\"      North Korea has in the past waited for senior U.S. officials to come to the country to secure the release of some American detainees. Both Fowle and Miller suggested that intervention from the highest levels in Washington — possibly a visit by a former president — might be needed to gain their release.      The U.S. has repeatedly offered to send its envoy for North Korean human rights issues, Robert King, to Pyongyang to seek a pardon for Bae and other U.S. detainees but without success.      Washington has no diplomatic ties with North Korea and no embassy in Pyongyang. Instead, the Swedish Embassy takes responsibility for U.S. consular affairs there.      Though a small number of U.S. citizens visit North Korea each year as tourists, the State Department strongly advises against it. After Miller's detention, Washington updated its travel warning to note that over the past 18 months, \\"North Korea detained several U.S. citizens who were part of organized tours.\\"      North Korea has been strongly pushing tourism lately in an effort to bring in foreign cash. But despite its efforts to bring in more visitors — mostly from neighboring China — it remains highly sensitive to any actions it considers political and is particularly wary of anything it deems to be Christian proselytizing.      In March, North Korea deported an Australian missionary detained for spreading Christianity in the country after he apologized and requested forgiveness.      ___      Associated Press writers Trenton Daniel at the United Nations; Dan Sewell in Cincinnati, Ohio; and Scott Smith and Matt Hamilton in Bakersfield, California, contributed to this report. ||||| Two US tourists being held in North Korea have called on the US government to help secure their release from the isolated country, in an interview with the Associated Press Television Network.      North Korea has said Matthew Miller and Jeffrey Fowle, held since early May, would be put on trial for crimes against the state.      \\"I am now requesting help from the American government, the citizens of America and the world to release me from this situation,\\" Mr Miller, 24, from Bakersfield, California, said in the interview, recorded in Pyongyang on Friday.      The video also showed a handwritten letter from Mr Fowle, 56, of Miamisburg, Ohio, that said he was arrested for leaving a bible at a site visited by his tour group in the northern city of Chongjin.      \\"I feel a great urgency to get back to my family! Please help me come back home!,\\" the letter said.      Mr Fowle said of the letter: \\"My aim is to get that message out to as many people who can hear it, to help us come home.\\"      Both men were talking to someone off camera. Neither made eye contact with the camera.      It was not clear if the interview was given in the presence of North Korean government officials.      A source familiar with Mr Fowle's arrest confirmed to Reuters that he left the bible at the Chongjin Seamen's Club – a faded compound originally designed for visiting mariners to the industrial port town in North Korea's east.      North Korean authorities arrested Mr Miller for ripping up his tourist visa and attempting to claim political asylum, state media said. He was travelling alone, said a statement published on the website of Uri Tours, the travel agency that arranged Mr Miller's trip to North Korea.      North Korea has three US citizens in custody, including Kenneth Bae, a missionary of Korean descent who was arrested in November 2012 and convicted and sentenced to 15 years hard labour last year.      Mr Bae said he feels abandoned by his government and has appealed again for help in securing his release, a pro-North Korea newspaper reported on Thursday.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Footloose Context: After a long night of partying, Bobby Moore and four of his friends become drunk and drive over a bridge and crash into a truck, killing all five. Bobby's father Shaw Moore, the Reverend of the Bomont, Georgia church, persuades the city council to pass several draconian laws, including a ban on all unsupervised dancing within the city limits. Three years later, Ren McCormack, a Boston-raised teenager, moves to Bomont to live with his uncle, aunt, and cousins after his mother's death from leukemia and his father's abandonment. Soon after arriving, Ren befriends Willard Hewitt, a fellow senior at Bomont High, and from him learns about the ban on dancing. He soon begins to be attracted to Moore's rebellious daughter - Bobby's sister Ariel - who is dating dirt-track driver Chuck Cranston. After an insult from Chuck, Ren ends up in a game involving buses, and wins despite his inability to drive one. Reverend Moore distrusts Ren and forbids Ariel from ever seeing him again. Ren and his classmates want to do away with the law and have a senior prom. After a while Ariel begins to fall for Ren and dumps Chuck, and he beats her up. Moore initially wants Ren arrested for Ariel's beaten condition, but Ariel tells him that he can't blame everything on Ren just like he did with Bobby, who was killed in the car crash. She then reveals that she is no longer a virgin, causing Moore to slap her. Moore's wife, Vi, is supportive of the dancing movement, explaining to Moore he cannot be everyone's father, and that he is hardly being good to Ariel. She also says that dancing and music are not the problem. Ren goes before the city council and reads several Bible verses given to him by Ariel, that describe how in ancient times people would dance to rejoice, exercise, celebrate, and/or worship. Ren also teaches Willard how to dance. The city council votes against him. Undaunted, Ren convinces the cotton mill owner to let them have a prom there; the mill is just outside city limits.

A:","output":"Even though the city council denied the motion to dismiss the law, Ren tells Moore that they cannot stop the spirit of celebrating and enjoying their youth, which includes dancing. In the context of the movie Footloose, Ren McCormack is determined to challenge the ban on unsupervised dancing within the city limits of Bomont, Georgia. This ban was put in place after a tragic accident resulted in the deaths of five teenagers, including Reverend Moore's son. The Reverend, Shaw Moore, is a significant influence on the city council and is determined to maintain strict control over the youth in an attempt to prevent such accidents from happening in the future. Ren believes that it is important for the young people in Bomont to have the opportunity to express themselves through dancing and music, as these activities offer a healthy outlet for their emotions and a social platform for connecting with their peers. When the city council votes against dismissing the law banning unsupervised dancing, Ren does not give up. Instead, he turns to a nearby cotton mill located just outside of the city limits and is able to convince the owner to host a senior prom where the students can dance. Ren's actions, along with the support from his friends and even Reverend Moore's own wife, demonstrate that despite the efforts of the council and the influence of Reverend Moore, the desire for freedom of expression in the form of dancing and celebration cannot be silenced. While certain measures can be put in place, ultimately the human spirit and the need for connection and self-expression will find a way to prevail. The movie, Footloose, serves as a reminder that it is important to embrace the joy of celebrating life and the significance of nurturing the emotional well-being of young people in the face of adversity and tragic loss."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph:   During metamorphism, a rock may change chemically.

(The Walt Disney Company, Lucasfilm) ★★★ “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” (PG-13) “'The Force Awakens' has succeeded where it counts most, in creating a cast of characters that viewers can spend the next several years rooting for, especially the spirited, resourceful heroine at its center. Put another way — and hallelujah for it — there’s not a Binks in the bunch.” – Ann Hornaday Comedic duo Tina Fey and Amy Poehler unite for a movie about two sisters who throw one last party at their childhood home, which their parents are about to sell.

'Sisters' goes for broke in both directions, with winning, helplessly entertaining results. Even at its naughtiest, it’s never not nice.” – Ann Hornaday ★★ “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip” (PG) “'The Road Chip' is basically an overlong metaphor for the beauty of blended families.

A flashback shifts to his boxing career in 1941 against his opponent, Jimmy Reeves, in the infamous Cleveland bout. Losing the fight by a fixed result causes a fight to break out at the end of the match. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) is not only a sparring partner to him but also responsible for organizing his fights.Joey discusses a potential shot for the title with one of his mob connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent), on the way to his brother's house in their neighborhood in the Bronx. When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities. Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army. This does not deter Jake from winning six straight fights, but as his fears grow about his wife, Vickie, having feelings for other men, particularly Tony Janiro, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he is keen enough to show off his sexual jealously when he beats him in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colosanto) and Vickie.The recent triumph over Janiro is touted as a major boost for the belt as Joey discusses this with journalists, though Joey is briefly distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew.

Her neighbor, an old, recently widowed woman named Mrs. Nasone who owns a small dog named Phil, also starts to notice her odd behavior. On her walk home from work the next day, Thana is noticed by a young man on the street while she is disposing of one of the bagged body parts; thinking that she accidentally dropped the bag, he retrieves it, frightening her. He chases her through the alleys of the city, and fearing another sexual assault, she fatally shoots him when she is cornered by him. The event furthers her impulse for vengeance. While running home from the incident, Mrs. Nasone notices she ran up the stairs violently and started throwing up. She insists in calling a doctor for Thana, and Mrs. Nasone's dog, Phil, starts to become attracted to her fridge. Thana escorts her out...

Answer: A:","output":"The tone of this product review can be considered both positive and negative.  On the positive side, the reviewer praises the bikes as gifts for a children's shelter and mentions that 4 of the bikes were wonderful. This demonstrates that, overall, they found the bikes to be good products that served their purpose. However, the negative tone emerges due to the issue of a missing back tire on one of the bikes. This frustration is evident through the use of multiple exclamation marks in the title and the criticism of the product's quality control, which they attribute to the manufacturer in China. The reviewer also mentions that they were unable to return the faulty bike due to shipping constraints, adding to their dissatisfaction. Thus, while there are elements of satisfaction mentioned in the review, a significant portion of the tone conveys a negative experience with the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Once the cocoon hatches, the adult insect, now transformed and featuring fully developed wings, carefully emerges from its protective casing.

Trivia question: In the periodic table which metal follows lithium and sodium in the alkali metals (valency 1)? And the answer is?","output":"The metal that follows lithium (Li) and sodium (Na) in the alkali metals group with a valency of 1 in the periodic table is potassium (K). Potassium is the third element in Group 1 (also known as the alkali metals) of the periodic table, coming after lithium and sodium. It has an atomic number of 19 and is represented by the chemical symbol K, which was derived from the Latin word “kalium.” Alkali metals are known to have a valency of 1 and form +1 ions, which means they easily give up one electron to achieve a stable electron configuration. Similar to lithium and sodium, potassium is also a highly reactive metal and is not found free in nature. It readily reacts with water, forming potassium hydroxide (KOH), and releasing hydrogen gas. Moreover, the reactivity increases as you move down the Group 1 elements. Thus, potassium is more reactive than both lithium and sodium. Potassium is a soft, silvery-white metal with a low melting point, which can be easily cut with a knife. It has diverse applications, particularly in agriculture and biology. It is one of the essential nutrients for plants and is often found in fertilizers. In addition to that, potassium is also vital for the proper functioning of living organisms, especially in maintaining fluid balance, muscle contractions, and nerve impulses. To summarize, the metal that follows lithium and sodium in the alkali metals group of the periodic table with a valency of 1 is potassium, represented by the chemical symbol K and having an atomic number of 19. It shares similar characteristics with other alkali metals, such as high reactivity, softness, and the ability to readily form +1 ions. Potassium has diverse applications in agriculture, biology, and various industrial processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Across the board, water can make things?\\" is in \\"The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect of common observation is in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Across the board, water can make things?\\" based on the provided statement \\"The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect of common observation is in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.\\" is that water can make various substances and materials softer and more pliable. In the context of the statement, water content refers to the amount of water present within a substance or material. As water is introduced to these materials, it causes their structural components to loosen, allowing them to become more flexible and easier to manipulate. This softening effect can be observed in a variety of materials, such as wood, rawhide, paper, and cloth. The statement also highlights that this softening effect is not unlimited. It is dependent on the water content within the material and has an upper limit. Essentially, there is an optimal amount of water content that will have the most significant softening effect on a given material. Beyond this point, adding more water may not increase the softness or pliability of the material further. Additionally, it is important to note that while the softening effect of water is beneficial in some applications, it may not always be desirable. For instance, the structural integrity of buildings and furniture made of wood might be compromised if excessive amounts of water are present. In such cases, it becomes necessary to manage moisture levels correctly to maintain the functional properties of the materials involved. In summary, the answer to the question \\"Across the board, water can make things?\\" is that water can make materials and substances softer and more pliable, which can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the context and desired properties of the material. This effect has limits and is dependent on the water content found within the material."},{"instruction":"Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"What is something that can be hazardous to use in public?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

(AP... (Associated Press)      The 2,000 fans assembled to watch the game on a Jumbotron a park across from City Hall grew in numbers and volume throughout the chilly and foggy night, exploding in unison with a roar with the final out.      Fans across the city left their televisions and raced into the streets, where they were greeted by diners and bar patrons who raced outside to celebrate as well. Car horns blared long into the night and revelers blocked traffic in front of popular watering holes around town.      At Polk and Bush streets in the city's Polk Gulch neighborhood, hundreds of fans sprayed champagne, set of off firecrackers and blocked traffic for at least two hours after the game.      Several blocks away, police clad in riot gear looked on as revelers danced around Civic Center plaza where they watched the game on the Jumbotron.      Anthony Yos, 10, hugged his brother Luciano Yos, 15 and the two danced in an embrace with their parents.      \\"This is the greatest thing,\\" Anthony said with a smile that could go no wider. \\"The Giants are my favorite team.\\"      Someone in the crowd launched fireworks a few minutes after the game and the park was awash with revelers, strangers hugging strangers and wine bottles and marijuana cigarettes being freely passed through the crowd despite a heavy police presence.      \\"This is San Francisco, \\"said Laura Chu. \\"We know how to party.\\"      Sara Vivas brought her 6-year-old daughter Briana Cepeda from Oakland to view the game and join the celebration. They were both clad head-to-toe in Giants garb.      \\"This is something she will remember forever,\\" Sara said.      Bars of all stripes, from the Castro to Chinatown were packed with supporters of the beloved Giants.      So-called pedicabs whisked fans down roads blocked to traffic and revelers enjoyed a New Year's Eve-like freedom to roam up and down streets usually clogged with traffic.      Small fires broke out in trash cans here and there, but the violence and vandalism appeared to have been kept to a minimum a few hours after the last pitch.      Shortly before midnight, police said the street celebration was still going.      \\"We're watching out for any major flareups and fires,\\" said police spokesman officer Carlos Manfredi. \\"We want to maintain public safety at all times, and don't want to put first responders in any danger.\\"      He said police were responding to certain hot spots but had no reports of serious problems. No arrest figures were available.      Mayor Edwin Lee announced the ticker-tape parade would be held Wednesday at 11 a.m., down Market Street to Civic Center Plaza      \\"The rain in Detroit couldn't dampen the drive, talent and determination of the San Francisco Giants team tonight. Once again, the Giants brought our City together as we all cheered on our hometown heroes to another remarkable World Series victory,\\" he said.      The 2010 parade drew hundreds of thousands fans, who lined the streets of downtown San Francisco. The parade ends at City Hall.      The party started early in Civic Center park, with many showing up hours before the 5 p.m. game on a nice Indian Summer day in San Francisco, wearing shorts and t-shirts. The blankets and sweaters came out when the sun went down and the fog rolled in, but the chill didn't damper the enthusiasm. Many in the crowd were carrying brooms in hope of the series sweep that came to be.      \\"We they were going to sweep,\\" said Elizabeth Choy-Lau, 32, of San Francisco. She and her husband were carrying brooms.      \\"There was no doubt,\\" said Steve Lau, 30.      The city's ubiquitous food trucks did a brisk business and drummers of all types beat their instruments throughout the game.      \\"Where else in the world do you want to be tonight,\\" replied Dave Wormald of Toronto. Wormald and two other colleagues were in town for a business meeting and were watching the game at their hotel when they decided to embark for City Hall.      \\"This is the place to be,\\" said Jim Vliet, Wormald's colleague. ||||| S.F. Giants fans delirious with joy GIANTS SWEEP!      They agonized through the cliff-hanger playoffs. They held their breath as their heroes crushed the Detroit Tigers in the first three games. And then, after 10 nail-biting innings on Sunday, as the final pitch sealed the Giants' World Series win - San Francisco fans exploded with joy.      By the thousands, they screamed their happiness to the sky and to each other. They took over whole streets from the Mission District to North Beach to the Civic Center to outside AT&T Park. They sprayed beer all over each other and danced in conga lines.      A few of the rowdier ones set off fireworks, lit bonfires and climbed atop Muni buses or any car that happened to be at hand.      \\"Oh man, it's so exciting,\\" Brandon Mandap, 27, of Vallejo yelled as fireworks exploded over Civic Center Plaza, where thousands of people spent more than 3 1/2 hours watching on the big screen as the Giants finished off the Detroit Tigers. \\"It's amazing to be here. I love this city!\\"      All around him, people blew horns, drummed in a mosh pit and hugged each other.

Giants fans delirious with joy 1 / 52 Back to Gallery      \\"We swept them,\\" said Frank Orrell, 29. \\"You can't do anything better than that.\\"      Noel Salcedo, a 29-year-old banker from Walnut Creek, poured out of Lucky Strike bar near the Giants ballpark to join the on-the-spot, open-air party.      \\"We already made history, and here we are sweeping the Detroit Tigers after everybody counted us out!\\" he yelled. Inside the bar, moments after the Giants scored their game-winning run in the 10th inning, hundreds broke into chants of, \\"Mar-co Scut-aro,\\" and poured beer and Champagne on each other.      With the championship came the garb to prove it. Marjorie Anicete, 23, of San Bruno watched the entire game inside the Giants Dugout store at the ballpark. She was among the first to purchase a World Championship T-shirt for 32.      \\"Once they started wheeling in the boxes, everyone started going crazy,\\" Anicete said. \\"There's so much adrenaline running through my veins - I can't believe this is happening.\\"      \\"I knew we'd go deep into the playoffs but now - I'm out of my mind right now!\\" Jon Comeaux, 23, of San Leandro yelled over the crowd noise in Civic Center Plaza.      \\"The Giants run in our blood,\\" beamed Sam Jordan III at the bar that bears his forebear's name, Sam Jordan in the Bayview. \\"It's all we've known all our life.\\"      Behind him, the game shone from every TV in the place. Hip-hop music was also pounding the walls, but for the whole game, everyone's attention was on the men in orange and black up on the screens.      \\"They thought Detroit was going to run over us. It was Verlander this, Verlander that,\\" said Jordan, referring to the Tigers' ace pitcher, Justin Verlander. \\"But Giants fans knew we could win.\\"      Fans were decked out all over the city in the team colors, some combining them with Halloween costumes. In Civic Center, one man pasted a Giants logo over the chest of his Superman costume, and a woman wrapped her witch's hat in orange ribbons.      Eddie Mueller, 26, of San Francisco was wearing an orange jumpsuit issued by an Alameda County jail. He wouldn't say how he got it, but he said it did more than just communicate his team pride.      \\"It's a two-for-one kind of outfit,\\" he said. \\"If they win and I get good and crazy tonight, I'm all ready to go to jail. They don't even need to change my clothes.\\"      Police said they were ready for just such behavior, having called in extra officers.      The last time the Giants won the World Series, two years ago, fights and fires broke out amid the celebrating, particularly near the ballpark and in the Mission. Sunday night, some officers and firefighters carried portable fire extinguishers, because in 2010 the crowds were so huge that fire trucks had trouble getting through.      \\"We're going to help the partiers party,\\" said police Sgt. Tad Yamaguchi. \\"As long as they're lawful and having fun, we're all for it.\\"      At Mission and 22th streets, fans lit bonfires and danced around the flames. At 11:30 p.m., police finally had enough, and after revelers threw beer bottles at them they charged the crowd and cleared it from the blaze.      Flames also flickered from a street bonfire outside the ballpark, but there, police kept their distance.      \\"It's a street party - how often do we get a chance to party like this?\\" Sara Schillings, 24, of Antioch said as she threw an empty Champagne bottle with one hand and drank a beer with the other. \\"Nobody wants to hurt anybody.\\"      Tom \\"Catman\\" Wolfe sat off to the side in his wheelchair at Third and King streets, soaking it all in. He's 58 and has been a Giants fan since he was growing up in New Jersey.      \\"Two championships in three years, oh my God, I don't believe it,\\" Wolfe said. \\"But tonight, I have to believe it.\\"      Chronicle staff writers Demian Bulwa, Vivian Ho and Will Kane contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"A long time ago, in 2012, people were very excited because the San Francisco Giants baseball team won the World Series.

Given the question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: There is a reason they are so cheap! Review: I purchased this kit in hopes that it would help me to be able to predict ovulation. They didnt. At the same time, I was using another test which showed the surge. These sticks did not. The same thing happened with the pregnancy tests. I used them for 10 days and got nothing. Then I finally took a real test from a drugstore to use at the same time as my last test strip and it was very clear that I was pregnant, but these strips still said no! I would not rely on these for much. Sure the cost is okay, but when the result is nothing, there is no reward. For peace of mind, especially if you have been trying to concieve for a long time, choose a name brand you can trust. Answer: The answer is:","output":"The tone of this product review is decidedly negative.  Firstly, the title itself conveys a negative tone, with the phrase \\"There is a reason they are so cheap!\\" This not only implies that the product is low cost, but also possibly low quality. The exclamation point at the end emphasizes the reviewer's dissatisfaction.  The body of the review provides supporting examples of the product's failures from the reviewer's personal experience. The reviewer plainly states, \\"They didn't,\\" when recounting if the product helped with predicting ovulation. One of the more explicitly negative sentences in the review states, \\"I would not rely on these for much.\\" This comment indicates a lack of faith in the product's reliability or efficacy.  The reviewer also delivers a comparison, mentioning, \\"Then I finally took a real test from a drugstore to use at the same time as my last test strip and it was very clear that I was pregnant, but these strips still said no!\\" This comparison implies that the product is inferior to alternatives on the market.  Furthermore, it's clearly stated, \\"For peace of mind, especially if you have been trying to conceive for a long time, choose a name brand you can trust.\\" The reviewer suggests that other products - specifically name brand ones - are more trustworthy.  Lastly, the reviewer uses words and phrases throughout the review that suggest disappointment and dissatisfaction, such as \\"nothing\\", \\"no reward\\", \\"did not\\", which further contributes to the overall negative tone of the review.  In conclusion, the reviewer is unhappy with their purchase and does not recommend the product, resulting in a negative tone for this product review."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They scored first with Michael Vick hooking up with Riley Cooper on a 2-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead, however, the Boys responded with Tony Romo finding Felix Jones on an 11-yard pass for a 7-7 lead.  Then increased their lead in the 2nd quarter as Dan Bailey kicked a 30-yard field goal for a 10-7 halftime lead.  Michael Vick had been knocked out of the game and was possibly out for the season after going 6/9 for 70 yards and a touchdown pass.  Rookie QB Nick Foles would get his first NFL action and threw his first touchdown pass to Jeremy Maclin from 44 yards out as the Eagles retook a 14-10 lead while Henery moved the team ahead 17-10 with a 40-yard field goal.  After this, the Cowboys went back to work as Romo found Dez Bryant on a 30-yard touchdown pass to tie the game at 17-17.  Then the Boys retook the lead with Dwayne Harris returned a punt 78-yards for a touchdown for a 24-17 lead followed up by Brandon Carr returning an interception 47 yards for a touchdown and a 31-17 lead.  The Eagles then got back to work with Stanley Havili 1-yard touchdown run (with a failed PAT) to shorten the lead to 31-23.

Write a summary based on this article: Politicians must pander, it goes with the job. But they mustn't leave their fingerprints all over their pandering. The Romney campaign's attempt to score political points on the killing of American diplomats was a dismal business in every respect. Disregarding every other aspect, however, it was graceless and stupid as a matter of politics.      The incident reminds of one other thing: the dangerously distorting effect of disrespect for one's political opponents.      Inside Team Romney, and among Romney's donors and core supporters, it may be taken absolutely for granted that Barack Obama is a weak-willed appeaser of radical Islam, a cringing apologizer for America who does not love the country the way \\"we\\" do. So why not say it loud, especially when you think you've just caught his administration doing it again? And then you discover the mistake only after the statement has departed the outbox.            (Romney's press conference can be viewed at MSNBC.)       ||||| AP Photo Close      The Obama administration is disavowing a statement from its own Cairo embassy that seemed to apologize for anti-Muslim activity in the United States.      \\"The statement by Embassy Cairo was not cleared by Washington and does not reflect the views of the United States government,\\" an administration official told POLITICO.      The U.S. embassy in Cairo put out a statement early Tuesday that was pegged to anger over an anti-Muslim film being circulated by an Israeli-American real estate developer.      \\"The Embassy of the United States in Cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims – as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions,\\" the embassy said in a statement published online.      (PHOTOS: Anti-U.S. attacks in Cairo, Libya)      According to the Wall Street Journal, the film depicts the Muslim prophet Muhammed as a \\"womanizer, pedophile and fraud\\" — a depiction bound to offend many Muslims.      The embassy came under widespread criticism for failing to defend free speech in the face of threats of violence. Egyptian protesters rioted anyway, breaching the embassy walls and tearing down the American flag.      \\"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind,\\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a Tuesday statement.      The Romney campaign accused the Obama administration of sympathizing with the protests in a statement released after the administration statement.      “I'm outraged by the attacks on American diplomatic missions in Libya and Egypt and by the death of an American consulate worker in Benghazi. It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks,” Romney said.

In talking points currently being pushed to Republican leaders and top surrogates, the Romney campaign recommends attacking President's Obama \\"foreign policy of weakness\\" and dismissing questions about how the campaign responded to the crisis last night.            A sample response, as proposed by the Romney campaign officials in Boston:      \\"Did Governor Romney 'jump the gun' last night in releasing his statement?\\"      \\"No. It is never too soon to stand up for American values and interests.\\"      Read the full list of message points from the Romney campaign, provided to CNN by a GOP source, below:      MESSAGE POINTS: Attacks On America's Diplomatic Missions In Libya And Egypt      Surrogate Message Points: Attacks On America’s Diplomatic Missions In Libya And Egypt      Top-Line Message:      - We join all Americans in grieving for the four American patriots who lost their lives in yesterday’s attacks and send our condolences to their loved ones.      - This is a time for America to be firm and resolute – and to make clear beyond any doubt that America will not tolerate attacks on our own.      - The violence against the American diplomatic missions in Libya and Egypt underscores that the world remains a dangerous place and that American leadership is sorely needed.      - Over the last several years, we have stood witness to an Arab Spring that presents both opportunity for a more peaceful and prosperous region, but also great peril if the forces of extremism and violence are allowed to control the course of events.      We must strive to ensure that the Arab Spring is not followed by an Arab Winter.      - American leadership is necessary to ensure that events in the region do not spin out of control.      - We have seen a foreign policy of weakness and decline in American influence and respect. Yesterday, we saw the consequences of this perceived weakness.      - America cannot send mixed signals to either our allies or our enemies.      - We must not be afraid to use our influence to support those who share our values and interests – and to stand firm against those who threaten them. America cannot shrink from its responsibility to lead.      Questions & Answers:      Don’t you think it was appropriate for the embassy to condemn the controversial movie in question? Are you standing up for movies like this?      - Governor Romney rejects the reported message of the movie. There is no room for religious hatred or intolerance.      - But we will not apologize for our constitutional right to freedom of speech.      - Storming U.S. missions and committing acts of violence is never acceptable, no matter the reason. Any response that does not immediately and decisively make that clear conveys weakness.      - If pressed: Governor Romney repudiated this individual in 2010 when he attempted to mobilize a Quran-burning movement. He is firmly against any expression of religious hatred or intolerance.      Reports indicate the embassy in Cairo released its initial statement before the invasion of the embassy commenced. Doesn’t this show they were trying to tamp down the protest and prevent what ultimately happened, not sympathize with the protesters?      - The Administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions.      - Distancing themselves from the statement and saying it wasn't ‘cleared by Washington’ reflects the mixed signals they are sending to the world.      - American leadership needs to be decisive and resolute when our interests are threatened or attacked. For the last four years, this has been lacking.      - We have seen a foreign policy of weakness, indecision, and a decline in American influence and respect – and yesterday we saw the consequences.      - If pressed: The Obama campaign is now attacking Governor Romney for being critical of the same statement the Administration itself disavowed. This is hypocritical.      Did Governor Romney “jump the gun” last night in releasing his statement?      - No. It is never too soon to stand up for American values and interests.      Full Romney Statement:      “Americans woke up this morning with tragic news and felt heavy hearts as they considered that individuals who have served in our diplomatic corps were brutally murdered across the world. This attack on American individuals and embassies is outrageous, it's disgusting. It breaks the hearts of all of us who think of these people who have served, during their lives, the cause of freedom, and justice and honor. We mourn their loss and join together in prayer that the spirit of the Almighty might comfort the families of those who have been so brutally slain.      “Four diplomats lost their life, including the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, in the attack on our embassy at Benghazi, Libya. And, of course, with these words, I extend my condolences to the grieving loved ones, who have left behind, as a result of these who have lost their lives in the service of our nation, and I know that the people across America are grateful for their service and we mourn their sacrifice.      “America will not tolerate attacks against our citizens and against our embassies. We will defend also our constitutional rights of speech and assembly and religion. We have confidence in our cause in America. We respect our Constitution. We stand for the principles our Constitution protects. We encourage other nations to understand and respect the principles of our Constitution because we recognize that these principles are the ultimate source of freedom for individuals around the world.      “I also believe the Administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. It's never too early for the United States Government to condemn attacks on Americans, and to defend our values. The White House distanced itself last night from the statement, saying it wasn't ‘cleared by Washington.’ That reflects the mixed signals they’re sending to the world.      “The attacks in Libya and Egypt underscore that the world remains a dangerous place and that American leadership is still sorely needed. In the face of this violence, America cannot shrink from the responsibility to lead. American leadership is necessary to ensure that events in the region don’t spin out of control. We cannot hesitate to use our influence in the region to support those who share our values and our interests. Over the last several years, we have stood witness to an Arab Spring that presents an opportunity for a more peaceful and prosperous region, but also poses the potential for peril, if the forces of extremism and violence are allowed to control the course of events.      “We must strive to ensure that the Arab Spring does not become an Arab Winter.” ||||| Now he takes a beating on Libya.      All things foreign seem foreign to Mitt Romney.      He says he'll save the American economy while banking in Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. He says he'll create American jobs as his company Bain Capital outsources jobs to China. He insults the Brits during the Olympics. He denigrates the Palestinian people as culturally inferior on a trip to Israel. He fails to even mention 190,000 American troops serving in Afghanistan at his convention speech. He still calls Russia \\"the Soviet Union\\" and labels it as America's No. 1 enemy.      If John Kerry was right when he said at the Democratic Convention the \\"last time Romney saw Russia was in 'Rocky 4,'\\" then the only thing he knows about Libya comes from watching Sasha Baron Cohen's \\"The Dictator.\\"      Now it's Romney's Libya gaffe on the anniversary of 9/11.      On Sept. 11, as the nation mourned the heroes and victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as non-partisan Americans, with all name-calling between the Obama and Romney camps on hiatus for one mournful day, U.S. Ambassador to Libya John Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed by religious fanatics who stormed the American consulate in Benghazi with grenade launchers and machine guns.      These savages were incited to murder because some fanatical Islamic cleric cited some obscure film made by an even more anonymous American filmmaker that had about as much chance of being released as the last 10 years of Romney's tax returns.      Several hours before the murders, as anti-American protests swelled, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo condemned \\"the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims — as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.\\"      A lame statement to be sure.      But the White House quickly said they never approved that statement, claiming, \\"It doesn't reflect the views of the U.S. government.\\"      Then all hell broke loose and four Americans were murdered in Benghazi.      But by 10 p.m. Boston time, before the last beacon of light dimmed at Ground Zero, before Taps had finished echoing through Lower Manhattan, before the last grieving family member had gone to bed on a politics- and politician-free 9/11 commemoration, Romney headquarters issued an embargoed statement to the media on the barbaric attacks.      The campaign okayed its release at 12:01 a.m. Sept. 12.      \\"I'm outraged by the attacks on American diplomatic missions in Libya and Egypt and by the death of an American consulate worker in Benghazi,\\" Romney said. \\"It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.\\"      Awful.      Political, exploitative, opportunistic.      As Rudy Giuliani learned when he ran for President the American people do not like politicians trying to exploit political mileage from the blood of our dead.      In boxing, a reckless roundhouse punch like Romney's is the mark of a desperate \\"amacha\\" reeling on the ropes after Obama scored a five-point post-convention bump in the polls.      Romney's Libyan punch missed by a mile and as we bury more innocent Americans killed on Sept. 11, it leaves Romney open for the kind of counterpunch from which even the best fighters often don't recover.

Four Americans, including Christopher Stevens, the US Ambassador to Libya, were killed in an attack on the US consulate in Benghazi Tuesday. The attackers were armed with guns and rockets and were reportedly angry about a YouTube film that made derogatory statements about Islam and its central figure, Mohammed. In a statement released to the press this morning, President Barack Obama \\"strongly\\" condemned the \\"outrageous attack,\\" saying that the slain US personnel \\"exemplified America's commitment to freedom, justice, and partnership with nations and people around the globe, and stand in stark contrast to those who callously took their lives.\\"      There were also protests at the US Embassy in Cairo, where Republicans seized on a weak initial statement from officials there to paint the Obama administration as soft-on-Islam (the US Ambassador to Egypt, Anne W. Patterson, is career diplomat who also served as Bush's Ambassador to Pakistan). The initial statement (which appeared before the attacks on the embassies) and a few since-deleted tweets apologized for the offending video and criticized the \\"continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims.\\" Though the White House told Politico it hadn't approved the statement, GOP Presidential nominee Mitt Romney accused President Barack Obama of sympathizing with the embassy attackers, saying:      I'm outraged by the attacks on American diplomatic missions in Libya and Egypt and by the death of an American consulate worker in Benghazi. It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.      Likewise, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted yesterday that \\"Obama sympathizes with attackers in Egypt. Sad and pathetic.\\" So the official Republican response to Americans being killed abroad yesterday is that the president of the United States is on the side of the killers, so vote Romney.      Despite the persistent Republican fantasy that the United States conducts diplomacy the way that Sean Hannity used to treat Alan Colmes, it's not clear a Republican President would have reacted differently to initial reports. In 2006, when European newspapers published cartoons denigrating Islam's prophet Mohammed, the Bush administration similarly affirmed free speech rights but said that \\"We find them offensive, and we certainly understand why Muslims would find these images offensive.\\" ||||| 4 years ago      (CNN) - Mitt Romney's decision to comment on the diplomatic attacks in the Middle East is revealing a split among Republicans who differ over the GOP nominee's remarks on the violence.      \\"Too quick to politicize over faulty reporting initially. Too quick to politicize (the) death of foreign service officers. Makes him appear not ready,\\" is how one top adviser to John McCain's 2008 campaign put it to CNN.            - Follow the Ticker on Twitter: @PoliticalTicker      - Check out the CNN Electoral Map and Calculator and game out your own strategy for November.      But other Republican strategists felt emboldened by Romney's swift and severe condemnation of how the administration's handling of the crisis.      \\"This could be a game changer,\\" GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos said. \\"Romney has to go at this and make it clear that he is doing it not for political gain but because weak, apologetic leadership is dangerous for the country.\\"      Castellanos was an adviser to Romney during the 2008 presidential campaign, but does not work for the candidate in 2012.      Late last night, Romney released a statement that was initially embargoed until midnight in keeping with the campaign's decision to avoid political attacks on the president on September 11th. But within minutes the embargo was lifted.      \\"It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks,\\" Romney said in the statement.      Romney later explained at a morning news conference he was referring to a statement released by the U.S. Embassy in Cairo that condemned a filmmaker for mocking Islam. However, the embassy's statement came out before the violence erupted. (The embassy confirmed the statement on Twitter after the walls of the embassy were breached.)      In response to questions from reporters about whether he had commented too soon in his initial statement, before the confirmation of the death of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, Romney called the queries a \\"hypothetical.\\" He noted the administration backed away from the Embassy's statement.      \\"They clearly sent mixed messages to the world,\\" Romney said.      Other Republican leaders took a more cautious approach in their statements on the violence.      \\"Eleven years after September 11, this is a jolting reminder that freedom remains under siege by forces around the globe who relish violence over free expression, and terror over democracy,\\" Boehner said in the statement. ||||| Topics: Diplomacy, 2012 Elections, Libya, Mitt Romney, Politics News      Ali Aujali, Libya’s ambassador to the U.S., spoke movingly of his late counterpart, Christopher Stevens, and said it was “sad” to see some in the U.S. politicizing the tragedy. Speaking with Salon after a press conference in Washington organized by the Islamic Society of North America, Aujali also said he thought the U.S. Embassy in Cairo did the “right thing” by issuing a statement condemning an anti-Islamic video, a statement that has since been disavowed by the Obama administration and sparked bitter condemnation from Mitt Romney.      Asked about the U.S. political fracas that has erupted since Romney attacked Obama’s handling of the protests in Cairo and Benghazi, Libya, last night, Aujali said he hoped it would be a time for unity. “I’d like to see very much the American people come together and help the Libyan people together, either Republican or Democratic,” said Aujali, who called Stevens a dear friend and his tennis partner. ||||| Senior Republicans on Capitol Hill are leaving GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney out on a limb after he criticized President Barack Obama’s “disgraceful” handling of the assault on the U.S. embassy in Libya, which led to the death of U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens.      (Also on POLITICO: Romney blasts Obama ‘apology’)      Text Size -      +      reset      Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee who personally knew Stevens, refused to assign any blame to the Obama administration.      “My heart is with Mr. Stevens, my former staff member, my friend,” Lugar told POLITICO on Wednesday. As a Pearson Fellow to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Stevens served as a staffer for Lugar in 2006. Lugar helped shepherd Stevens’s nomination as ambassador through his panel earlier this year.      “I’m not going to make any comment about the political. None,” the senator added.      While Romney was very critical of Obama in a morning statement on the Libya attacks, senior Republicans across the board avoided criticizing the administration shortly after Stevens’ death was announced.      Obama didn’t even get a mention in most GOP press statements blasted Wednesday morning.      “We mourn for the families of our countrymen in Benghazi, and condemn this horrific attack,” House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement Wednesday.      “Eleven years after September 11, this is a jolting reminder that freedom remains under siege by forces around the globe who relish violence over free expression, and terror over democracy — and that America and free people everywhere must remain vigilant in defense of our liberties.”      Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also declined to invoke Obama, signaling that for a second day in a row this was a time for Americans to come together and put election-year politics on hold. On Tuesday, Republicans and Democrats gathered on the steps of the Capitol to mark the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.      “Our thoughts and sympathy today are with the families of these brave Americans,” McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said on the Senate floor. “These attacks remind us of the sacrifices made on a daily basis by foreign service officers, diplomatic security personnel, and our Marine Security Guards.”      Three of the most important voices on foreign policy — Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) — said they were “anguished and outraged” by the deaths of American diplomats, and considered Stevens a “friend.” But they, too, didn’t see fit to criticize the president the way Romney did.      (PHOTOS: Anti-U.S. attacks in Cairo, Libya)      “In the midst of last year’s uprising in Libya, Chris traveled at great personal risk to Benghazi to represent the country he loved as the U.S. envoy to the Libyan opposition,” the senators said in a joint statement. ||||| It's a simple story, but it's got enough moving parts to be worth retelling in brief. So:      - A group of Coptic Christians, now understandably in hiding, released a baffling satirical video that mocked Muhummad. (You can see the video here.)            - Over several days, the video plays about as well as the 2006 \\"Danish cartoons\\" did. Early on Tuesday, the U.S. embassy in Egypt (home to many Coptics) releases a statement that \\"condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims.\\" (The embassy itself, as CNBC reports, had been partially emptied before the statement was made.) The statement is tweeted at 6:11 a.m. Eastern time.            - Despite that overture, protests break out at the embassy—culminating in the raising of a black-and-white flag that resembles the icon of al-Qaida. At 6:30 p.m. Eastern time, the embassy's Twitter account reiterates that it \\"stands by\\" the statement.      - In the next few hours, as America's embassy in Benghazi, Libya, is attacked, the Obama administration and the State Department distance themselves from the Egyptian embassy's press release. The embassy's statement is disavowed; Hillary Clinton says this:      The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.      Politico's Byron Tau posted that at 10:06 p.m. ET.      - At 10:09 p.m. ET, the Romney campaign sends out a statement to reporters. It's \\"embargoed until midnight tonight,\\" i.e., until after the 9/11 anniversary. Romney:            I'm outraged by the attacks on American diplomatic missions in Libya and Egypt and by the death of an American consulate worker in Benghazi. It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.      At 10:24, the campaign lifts the embargo and reporters start mentioning the statement.      - At 12:01 a.m. ET, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus tweets:      Notice that the timestamp says \\"9:01 p.m.\\" Twitter's website is cued to Pacific Time. Both the RNC and the Romney campaign were honoring a 9/11 embargo that ended only when 9/12 came to the Eastern time zone.      It was only after this that the extent of the attacks in Benghazi became known. I think that's why, today, you're seeing the GOP leadership in Congress—Cantor, Boehner—condemn the attacks without mentioning the Obama administration at all. No one else is trudging into that particular tar pit. ||||| Mitt Romney's morning press conference on the embassy attacks is recorded for posterity below. He gave it as all manner of reporters were getting their sources to dump on the Romney campaign. Very cool-headed.            It's also a bit slippery. Last night Romney said this: \\"It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.\\" All day, reporters have been pointing out that the administration's full response contradicted the Egyptian embassy -- which put out its statement before the fatal and unrelated attacks in Libya. Romney's clean-up: \\"The embassy is the administration.\\" According to his read, \\"the president takes responsibility not just for the words that come from his mouth, but also the words that come from his ambassadors, from his embassies, from his State department.\\" When the White House contradicted the embassy, \\"I had the exact same reaction. These views were inappropriate. They were the wrong course to take.\\"      And so this is our new-new criticism of the Obama response.            The administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. It's never too early for the United States government to condemn attacks on Americans and to defend our values. The White House distanced itself last night from the statement saying it wasn't cleared by Washington. That reflects the mixed signals they're sending to the world.            I think Romney's trying to finesse the confusion over an event that happened half the world away, at night, when very few Americans were reading news. The original embassy statement went out before anyone had been hurt. But most people heard about the embassy violence. Today, they'll see images of the violence. And so, as this news trickles in, they're supposed to know that Romney condemned the \\"apology\\" of the Obama administration, but not to know precisely what part of the administration apologized, or what for.       |||||","output":"The Romney campaign's attempt to score political points on the killing of American diplomats was considered graceless and stupid as a matter of politics.

Question: Information:  - Hamelin (or ; German: \\"Hameln\\") is a town on the river Weser in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is the capital of the district of Hamelin-Pyrmont and has a population of roughly 56,000. Hamelin is best known for the tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.  - Josef Kramer ( 10 November 1906 -- 13 December 1945 ) was the Commandant of the Bergen - Belsen concentration camp . Dubbed \`\` The Beast of Belsen '' by camp inmates , he was a notorious German Nazi war criminal , directly responsible for the deaths of thousands of people . He was detained by the British army after the Second World War , convicted of war crimes and hanged on the gallows in Hamelin prison by British executioner Albert Pierrepoint .  - Commandant (or ) is a title often given to the officer in charge of a military (or other uniformed service) training establishment or academy. This usage is common in English-speaking nations. In some countries it may be a military or police rank. It is also often used to refer to the commander of a military prison or prison camp (including concentration camps and prisoner of war camps).  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Pied Piper of Hamelin (also known as the Pan Piper, the Rat-Catcher of Hamelin) is the subject character of a legend from the town of Hamelin (Hameln), Lower Saxony, Germany. The legend dates back to the Middle Ages, the earliest references describing a piper, dressed in multicolored (\\"pied\\") clothing, who was a rat-catcher hired by the town to lure rats away with his magic pipe. When the citizens refuse to pay for this service, he retaliates by using his instrument's magical power on their children, leading them away as he had the rats. This version of the story spread as folklore and has appeared in the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the Brothers Grimm, and Robert Browning, among others.  - To be hanged, drawn and quartered was from 1351 a statutory penalty in England for men convicted of high treason, although the ritual was first recorded during the reign of King Henry III (12161272). Convicts were fastened to a hurdle, or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where they were hanged (almost to the point of death), emasculated, disembowelled, beheaded and quartered (chopped into four pieces). Their remains were often displayed in prominent places across the country, such as London Bridge. For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead burned at the stake.  - The Weser is a river in Northwestern Germany. Formed at Hannoversch Münden by the confluence of the rivers Fulda and Werra, it flows through Lower Saxony, then reaching the Hanseatic-town Bremen (see: Hanseatic League), before emptying further north at Bremerhaven into the North Sea. On the opposite (west) bank is the town of Nordenham at the foot of the Butjadingen Peninsula; thus, the mouth of the river is in Lower Saxony. The Weser has an overall length of . Together with its Werra tributary, which originates in Thuringia, its length is .  - Albert Pierrepoint (30 March 1905  10 July 1992) was a long-serving hangman in England. He executed at least 400 people, including William Joyce (\\"Lord Haw-Haw\\") and John Amery. In Germany and Austria after the war, he executed some 200 people who had been convicted of war crimes. In England, Timothy Evans was hanged by Pierrepoint for a crime committed by his neighbour John Christie, who was also hanged by Pierrepoint.  - Torture (from the Latin \\"tortus\\", \\"twisted\\") is the act of deliberately inflicting physical or psychological pain on an organism in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or compel some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom. The force was initially administered by the War Office from London, which in 1964 was subsumed into the Ministry of Defence. The professional head of the British Army is the Chief of the General Staff.  - The War Office was a department of the British Government responsible for the administration of the British Army between the 17th century and 1964, when its functions were transferred to the Ministry of Defence.  - A war crime is an act that constitutes a serious violation of the law of war that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility. Examples of war crimes include intentionally killing civilians or prisoners, torture, destroying civilian property, taking hostages, perfidy, rape, using child soldiers, pillaging, declaring that no quarter will be given, and using weapons that cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.  - A gallows (or scaffold) is a frame, typically wooden, used for execution by hanging, or as a means of torture before execution, as was used when being hanged, drawn and quartered.  - Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck. The \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\" states that hanging in this sense is \\"specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck\\", though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain \\"hanging\\". Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times, and is the official execution method in numerous countries and regions. The first account of execution by hanging was in Homer's \\"Odyssey\\". In this specialised meaning of the common word \\"hang\\", the past and past participle is \\"hanged\\" instead of \\"hung\\".  - John Amery (14 March 1912  19 December 1945) was a British fascist who proposed to the Wehrmacht the formation of a British volunteer force (that subsequently became the British Free Corps) and made recruitment efforts and propaganda broadcasts for Nazi Germany. He was executed for treason after the war.    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'josef kramer' exhibits the relationship of 'occupation'.

The Adidas Jabulani was engineered as a theoretical improvement over your standard, 32-panel ball. With just eight panels, it had fewer stitches, and that, supposedly, meant a less-turbulent flight through the air, Brian Palmer explains in the Washington Post. But in reality, stitches actually create fairly even turbulence all over the ball, and it flies they way players expect. This year's ball, the Adidas Brazuca, has even fewer panels—just six. But it's also rough all over with bumps made from polyurethane. Like dimples on a golf ball, they should help the ball move predictably. At least two top players, Argentina's Lionel Messi and Spain's Iker Casillas, have applauded the new ball; on the other hand, they're both paid by Adidas, Palmer notes. Fortunately, researchers in Japan have also seen good results in tests of the ball, which is made up of x-shaped panels, the Los Angeles Times reports. And according to their study, the authors have \\"no competing financial interests.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Evolution of the World Cup Ball: From Adidas Jabulani to Brazuca Introduction: The World Cup is not just a battleground for the greatest football players; it also witnesses the evolution and competition of cutting-edge ball technology. One such advancement was the Adidas Jabulani in 2010, a ball that created quite a controversy. This year's World Cup ball, the Adidas Brazuca, promises to deliver improved performance. But what makes it different from its predecessor, and how has Adidas overcome the problems faced by the Jabulani? The Problem with the Jabulani: In 2010, footballers had a significant complaint about the World Cup ball - the Adidas Jabulani. Engineered with only eight panels, this was a theoretical improvement over the standard 32-panel ball, as it had fewer stitches leading to reduced air turbulence during its flight. This was explained by Brian Palmer in the Washington Post. However, in reality, stitches create even turbulence all around the ball, enabling players to anticipate its trajectory better. The absence of stitches in the Jabulani left players struggling with an unpredictable ball trajectory. Introducing the Adidas Brazuca: This year's World Cup ball, the Adidas Brazuca, addresses these concerns with notable changes. Firstly, it has even fewer panels – just six. Secondly, its surface is covered with rough bumps made from polyurethane, much like the dimples on a golf ball. These bumps allow the ball to travel through the air more predictably, giving players better control. Top Footballers Endorsing the Brazuca: Some of the sport's biggest names, such as Argentina's Lionel Messi and Spain's Iker Casillas have publicly praised the new ball. Nevertheless, their endorsements may be suspect as both athletes have sponsorship deals with Adidas, as noted by Palmer. However, independent support for the Brazuca comes in the form of a Japanese study that tested the ball and found it performing well. According to the Los Angeles Times report, the authors of this study have \\"no competing financial interests,\\" lending credibility to their findings. Conclusion: The Adidas Brazuca is set to impress football enthusiasts worldwide with its improved design and performance. Despite the controversy surrounding the Adidas Jabulani in 2010, the company has taken the criticism on board and made considerable improvements. Backed by endorsements from top players and scientific study, the Brazuca may very well be the ball that restores player confidence and brings greater excitement to the World Cup matches."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"On 22 December 2012, the UK ambassador to Argentina, John Freeman, was summoned to the Argentine government as protest against the claim.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What did the British claim in 2012?\\"","output":"While the statement \\"On 22 December 2012, the UK ambassador to Argentina, John Freeman, was summoned to the Argentine government as a protest against the claim\\" provides some context, it fails to provide sufficient information about the actual British claim made in 2012. A better, more detailed and long answer would be: In 2012, the British government, led by then-Prime Minister David Cameron, made a series of claims and took actions that led to protests by the Argentine government. The primary issue pertained to the decades-long dispute between the two countries over the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), a British overseas territory in the South Atlantic Ocean. The ongoing dispute primarily stems from the 1982 Falklands War, during which Argentina attempted to take control of the islands, but was defeated by British forces. In February 2012, the British government announced it was sending the HMS Dauntless, a Type-45 destroyer, to the South Atlantic, causing concerns in Argentina, which saw this move as an escalation in the long-standing dispute. The timing of this move coincided with the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War. Furthermore, a referendum on the political status of the Falkland Islands was scheduled for March 2013, in which the island's inhabitants would decide whether to retain their current status as a British overseas territory. In the backdrop of these developments, Prime Minister David Cameron made several remarks asserting British sovereignty over the Falklands and supporting the islanders' right to self-determination. In June 2012, he stated that he was \\"absolutely clear\\" that Britain would defend the Falklands in the same way it did in 1982 if there were any future attempts to take the islands. As a result of these claims and the perceived escalation of the dispute by the British government, on 22nd December 2012, UK Ambassador to Argentina, John Freeman, was summoned to the Argentine government as a protest against the British claims. The Argentine government’s strong objection stemmed from its belief that the British government was violating the United Nations' resolution urging both sides to avoid unilateral actions or decisions about the Falkland Islands. In summary, a more informative answer to the question \\"What did the British claim in 2012?\\" would be: In 2012, the British claim with respect to Argentina was the reassertion of its sovereignty over the disputed Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), spearheaded by then-Prime Minister David Cameron. This claim came in the context of escalating tensions between the two countries, with the British government sending a Type-45 destroyer to the South Atlantic and supporting a referendum on the islands' political status scheduled for March 2013. As a result of these claims, the UK Ambassador to Argentina, John Freeman, was summoned to the Argentine government as a protest on 22nd December 2012."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He went on to invent more devices   that allowed people to bring their own creativity to computing: the Macintosh, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad. People found his products beautiful and easy to use. Jobs also changed the music and film industries. He started Pixar, a film production company in 1986. Toy Story was the world's first computer-animated feature film  . \\"Steve was among the greatest of American _ -- brave enough to think differently, confident enough to believe he could change the world, and clever enough to do it,\\" said President Barack Obama. \\"By making computers personal and putting the Internet in our pockets, he made the information revolution not only easy to reach, but fun ... And there may be no greater praise to Steve's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his death on a device he invented.\\" All around the world, people are talking about the effects that Jobs' creations have had. By creating products that surprised people, he changed the way people worked and lived their everyday lives. Question: Which of the following about Steve Jobs is NOT true? Yes or no, is the answer \\"He built the Apple II in 1970.\\"? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the main question - \\"Which of the following about Steve Jobs is NOT true?\\" Step 2: Identify the statement to be evaluated - \\"He built the Apple II in 1970.\\" Step 3: Find relevant information from the article - \\"The Apple II, built when Jobs was just 21 years old, was the first personal computer to be widely sold to the public.\\" Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on the article information.  Steve Jobs was 21 years old when the Apple II was built. The article does not provide the exact year the Apple II was built. To determine if the statement is true or false, we need to find out what year Steve Jobs was 21 years old. Step 5: Find additional information - \\"Steve Jobs was born in Los Altos, California.\\" Step 6: Calculate what year Steve Jobs was 21 years old. Steve Jobs was born in 1955 (2011 (the year he died) - 56 years (his age at death)).  So, he was 21 years old in 1975 (1955 + 21 years). Step 7: Compare the statement to the calculated year. The statement says, \\"He built the Apple II in 1970.\\" However, based on our calculation, Steve Jobs was 21 years old in 1975, not 1970. Therefore, the statement is NOT true. Answer: Yes, the answer \\"He built the Apple II in 1970\\" is NOT true."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"The first wind farm in Australia was built in 1987, and it is known as the Salmon Beach Wind Farm, which is located near Esperance in Western Australia. The facility was developed by Renewable Energy Corporation Australia Pty Ltd (RECA) and consisted of six 60-kilowatt (kW) Windmaster turbines, with a total generating capacity of 360 kW. This wind farm was primarily aimed to demonstrate the potential of wind energy as a viable alternative in addressing the country's growing power demands and diversifying its energy mix towards renewable options. The Salmon Beach Wind Farm has historical significance as it marked the beginning of Australia's journey towards harnessing wind energy. Since then, the nation has made substantial progress, with various states and territories bolstering their renewable energy capacities. Australia's wind energy sector has grown significantly over the past three decades. As of 2021, there are more than 100 wind farms across the country, with a combined installed capacity of over 8,000 megawatts (MW). These wind farms play a crucial role in providing clean energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most notable wind projects in Australia is the Hornsdale Wind Farm, located in South Australia, which is famous for being the home to the world's largest lithium-ion battery storage facility. This wind farm has a capacity of 315 MW and comprises 99 wind turbines. Other significant wind farm projects include the Macarthur Wind Farm in Victoria, with a capacity of 420 MW, and the Snowtown Wind Farm in South Australia, with a capacity of 370 MW. Wind energy has become an increasingly significant contributor to Australia's overall electricity generation, and its future prospects are promising. Investments in new wind facilities, energy storage technology, and upgrades to existing wind farms have led to a continuous increase in the percentage of Australia's energy derived from wind power. Additionally, the Australian government has set ambitious renewable energy targets to be achieved by 2030, which will further motivate the development and expansion of wind energy projects across the nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  Neilston (Scots: Neilstoun, Scottish Gaelic: Baile Nèill, pronounced [paləˈnɛːʎ]) is a village and parish in East Renfrewshire in the west central Lowlands of Scotland. It is in the Levern Valley, 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of Barrhead, 3.8 miles (6.1 km) south of Paisley, and 5.7 miles (9.2 km) south-southwest of Renfrew, at the southwestern fringe of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Neilston is a dormitory village with a resident population of just over 5,000 people. Neilston is mentioned in documents from the 12th century, when the feudal lord Robert de Croc, endowed a chapel to Paisley Abbey to the North. Neilston Parish Church—a Category B listed building—is said to be on the site of this original chapel and has been at the centre of the community since 1163. Little remains of the original structure. Before industrialisation, Neilston was a scattered farming settlement composed of a series of single-storey houses, many of them thatched. Some domestic weaving was carried out using local flax. Water power from nearby streams ground corn and provided a suitable environment for bleaching the flax. The urbanisation and development of Neilston came largely with the Industrial Revolution. Industrial scale textile processing was introduced to Neilston around the middle of the 18th century with the building of several cotton mills. Neilston became a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing in the 18th century, which developed into a spinning and dying industry, and continued into the early 20th century. Although Neilston is known as a former milling village, agriculture has played, and continues to play, an economic role. The annual Neilston Agricultural Show is an important trading and cultural event for farmers from southwest Scotland each spring.Although heavy industry died out in the latter half of the 20th century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Neilston has continued to grow as a commuter village, supported by its position between Paisley and Glasgow, from roughly 1,000...  answer the following question:  What was the 2001 population count of the town that was a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing? Answer:","output":"The passage provided does not specifically mention the population count of Neilston in 2001. However, it does mention that Neilston is a dormitory village with a resident population of just over 5,000 people. It should be noted that the accurate 2001 population count can be found through census data or other official sources, but based on the information provided, we can infer that the population was around 5,000 residents during that time period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: how many characters are specified in ascii scheme?","output":"The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a character encoding scheme that was developed in the early 1960s to standardize the representation of textual data in computer systems. ASCII represents characters, including letters, numerals, punctuation marks, and some control codes, as fixed-length, 7-bit binary numbers. In the ASCII scheme, there are 128 characters specified, ranging from 0 to 127. These characters can be grouped into two main categories: 1. Control Characters (0-31 and 127): The first 32 characters (0 to 31) are known as control characters. While not printable as regular glyphs, they are essential for managing the flow of data and specifying non-printed behaviors such as backspacing, line breaks, and form feeds. Additionally, character 127 is the \\"Delete\\" control code. 2. Printable Characters (32-126): The remaining 96 characters (32 to 126) are referred to as printable characters. These include:        a. Space (32): This character represents a space between words or other printable elements.        b. Punctuation Marks (33-47, 58-64, 91-96, and 123-126): These characters include various punctuation symbols, such as exclamation marks, periods, commas, quotation marks, and more.        c. Digits (48-57): The numbers 0-9 are represented by ASCII codes 48 to 57.        d. Uppercase Letters (65-90): The 26 uppercase letters of the English alphabet are represented by ASCII codes 65 to 90.        e. Lowercase Letters (97-122): The 26 lowercase letters of the English alphabet are represented by ASCII codes 97 to 122. The widespread use of ASCII in early computer systems solidified its status as the standard character encoding scheme for several decades. However, as technology and global communication have expanded, it has been largely replaced by more extensive character sets, such as Unicode, which can accommodate a broader range of characters, including those from non-Latin scripts.

Question: What might an elderly person install a railing on to help them pull themselves up? Options: - deck - stairwell - flight of stairs - feet - house  The answer is \\"stairwell\\" because A:","output":"An elderly person might install a railing on a stairwell to help them pull themselves up due to several reasons, which include ensuring safety, providing support, and maintaining independence. Here's a detailed breakdown of these reasons: 1. Ensuring safety: As people age, their sense of balance and coordination can diminish, causing them to become more prone to accidental falls. Older adults are at a higher risk of falls, which can lead to severe injuries, such as fractures, sprains, and even long-term mobility issues. Installing a railing in a stairwell minimizes the risk of falling, providing elderly persons with a safer means of climbing up and down stairs. Railings offer a stabilizing grip and support, allowing them to firmly hold onto something while navigating this potentially hazardous area. 2. Providing support: Another reason is that the elderly might experience diminished physical strength and mobility. They may find it increasingly difficult to climb up and down stairs, which could cause them strain and discomfort. A railing, installed in a stairwell, acts as a sturdy support for them to hold onto, making it easier to pull themselves up the stairs. This additional support helps to alleviate the physical strain and mitigate any discomfort they might experience while climbing the stairs. 3. Maintaining independence: As people age, they often want to maintain their independence and continue performing daily tasks by themselves. A stairwell railing can be incredibly beneficial to elderly individuals looking to maintain their self-sufficiency. By providing a secure and stable support system, a railing enables older adults to navigate stairs safely and independently, without relying on the assistance of others. 4. Promoting overall well-being: Climbing stairs can be an essential form of daily exercise for the elderly, helping to maintain muscle strength, joint flexibility, and general cardiovascular health. By installing a railing in the stairwell, elderly individuals can continue to engage in this beneficial physical activity with a lower risk of injury, thereby positively contributing to their overall health and well-being. To sum up, installing a railing on a stairwell for an elderly person is a wise and practical decision. It serves multiple purposes, like ensuring safety, providing support, maintaining independence, and promoting overall well-being. While other options, such as a deck and a flight of stairs, could also benefit from railings, the stairwell is the most common and relevant location for incorporating this essential support system, making \\"stairwell\\" the best answer to this question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Solve this instance: Abstract: Abnormal left ventricular diastolic performance, an early manifestation of hypertension in the heart, may precede the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. To assess effects of antihypertensive therapy on the heart, left ventricular mass (determined by echocardiography) and rapid left ventricular filling rate (determined by radionuclide ventriculography) were compared before and after 6 months of treatment of 16 patients. Nitrendipine (a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) was given alone or in combination with either propranolol or hydrochlorothiazide, or both, and significantly reduced blood pressure (156/103 +/- 12/7 to 137/89 +/- 10/6 mm Hg). In 6 of the 16 patients, left ventricular mass decreased by more than 10% (270 +/- 95 to 193 +/- 47 g, p less than 0.01); in the same patients, left ventricular filling rate increased (2.03 +/- 0.35 to 2.30 +/- 0.45 end-diastolic counts/s [EDC/s], p less than 0.01). In the one patient whose left ventricular mass increased (137 to 195 g), left ventricular filling rate decreased from 2.01 to 1.78 EDC/s. In the remaining nine patients who had no change in left ventricular mass, there was no significant changes in left ventricular filling. The changes in ventricular mass and filling could not be related to the extent of change in blood pressure or heart rate. These data suggest that regression of left ventricular mass during antihypertensive therapy with nitrendipine is accompanied by improved diastolic function.

Is he pop? Are these two questions asking the same thing? OPT: (a). no. (b). yes.","output":"First question: Can someone like and enjoy several different kinds of genres of music? Absolutely, it is not only possible but also common for someone to like and enjoy various genres of music. Every individual has their own unique taste in music, which can be influenced by various factors including their upbringing, cultural background, personal experiences, and exposure to different forms of art and media. Liking and enjoying several kinds of music genres can also offer many benefits. Diversity in one's taste for music can enable them to appreciate different cultures and styles, which in turn contributes to a more open-minded and insightful perspective. It can also lead to a richer and more fulfilling listening experience, as each genre has its unique characteristics, emotional appeals, and artistic expressions. The wide variety of music genres available today caters to the diverse preferences of listeners, and it is not uncommon to find contrasting genres in someone's playlist. For instance, a person may enjoy the lyrical depth and storytelling in hip-hop, the rhythmic patterns and energy in electronic dance music (EDM), and the soul-stirring melodies in classical music. Furthermore, besides personal preferences, situational factors may also influence one's enjoyment of various music genres. Some days, a listener might prefer the calmness of an acoustic ballad, while on other occasions, they might be more inclined towards the excitement of a high-energy rock anthem. Overall, it is perfectly normal for people to like and enjoy several different genres of music as it allows them to explore a broader range of emotions and artistic expressions. Second question: What genre is Drake? Is he pop? Drake is primarily known for his work in hip-hop and R&B (rhythm and blues) genres. He has been consistently successful in merging rap and singing, which has contributed to his distinct and versatile style. Drake's music often incorporates elements of pop, making it highly accessible and appealing to a broad audience. However, labeling him as a pop artist would not provide the full picture of his musical identity. Drake's early music was heavily influenced by underground hip-hop, but as his career progressed, he started to blend different styles to create his signature sound. Over the years, he has incorporated elements of dancehall, trap, electronic, and even Afrobeat in his music, which has contributed to his massive success both in the hip-hop world and the mainstream music scene. While some of his songs may lean more towards pop due to their catchy hooks, production style, and mass appeal, it is essential to remember his contributions to the rap and R&B genres. Drake's ability to straddle various genres, experiment with his sound, and appeal to a wide range of audiences is a testament to his talent as an artist. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Option (a). No. The two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is about the possibility of someone liking and enjoying different genres of music, while the second question is focused on identifying the genre of a specific artist, Drake, and whether he can be classified as a pop artist. The first question is more general, relating to individual musical preferences and the concept of enjoying multiple genres. In contrast, the second question concentrates on understanding a particular artist's musical style to provide accurate classification."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The loss of his mother also prompted Tchaikovsky to make his first serious attempt at composition, a waltz in her memory. Tchaikovsky's father, who had also contracted cholera but recovered fully, sent him back to school immediately in the hope that classwork would occupy the boy's mind. Isolated, Tchaikovsky compensated with friendships with fellow students that became lifelong; these included Aleksey Apukhtin and Vladimir Gerard. Music, while not an official priority at school, also bridged the gap between Tchaikovsky and his peers. They regularly attended the opera and Tchaikovsky would improvise at the school's harmonium on themes he and his friends had sung during choir practice. \\"We were amused,\\" Vladimir Gerard later remembered, \\"but not imbued with any expectations of his future glory\\". Tchaikovsky also continued his piano studies through Franz Becker, an instrument manufacturer who made occasional visits to the school; however, the results, according to musicologist David Brown, were \\"negligible\\".In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger and questioned him about a musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice. A:","output":"The last name of the person whose mother died of cholera is Tchaikovsky. The article mentions that Tchaikovsky's mother passed away from cholera in 1854, and this event had a significant impact on his emotional state and musical development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Huawei CERN Preserve To understand the biggest thing we know - the universe - scientists must look very small. In seeking answers to what the universe is made of and how it started, researchers study fundamental particles, the basics of matter that are smaller than atoms. In learning how particles interact when they collide at close to the speed of light, scientists learn about the fundamental laws of nature. CERN - the Conseil EuropÃ©en pour la Recherche NuclÃ©aire - has notched numerous discoveries in its 60 years. Discovering proof for scientific theories about particle physics requires patience, consistent years - decades - of teamwork, aided by advances in technology. One of its biggest successes was in 2012, when CERN scientists discovered the Higgs boson. It became dubbed the âGod particleâ, because itâs so central to physics. The Higgs boson finding contributes to our understanding of the origin of the mass of subatomic particles. The discovery supports the Standard Model of particle physics, which started to gel in the mid-1950s and became clarified in the early 1970s, that aims to be the âtheory of almost everythingâ by going to the fundamentals of the universe: a few kinds of particles and four forces. Matter is made up of two types of particles: quarks and leptons. Another kind of particle, bosons, carries forces. There are four forces: strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravitational. The Higgs boson saga was more than five decades in the making. In the early 1960s, Peter Higgs and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh and FranÃ§ois Englert and Robert Brout at the Free University of Brussels predicted the existence of a particle that would explain why other particles have a mass. The search for the God particle began in the late 1960s, but technology lagged behind theory. By the 1980s, particle accelerators had developed to allow the first experiments, but they werenât yet powerful enough to allow scientists to definitively prove the hypothesis. CERNâs Large Electron-Positron Collider, with a circumference of 27 kilometers, is the largest electron-positron accelerator ever built and one of the worldâs biggest scientific machines. Experiments in it began in 1989 for 11 years, but it never found the Higgs boson. It was dismantel-ed in 2000 so its tunnel, 100 meters beneath Geneva, could be used for the next generation - the Large Hadron Collider. The Large Hadron Collider, the worldâs largest and most powerful particle accelerator and one of the biggest scientific machines ever, itself took decades to design and build, involving thousands of scientists, researchers and technicians. By the time it started up in 2008, it cost 6.5 billion Swiss francs (about US6.5 billion) to build. The LHC is a descendent of accelerators, the first of which appeared in 1957 at CERN. The collider uses magnets that are chilled to a temperature colder than outer space to bend two high-energy particle beams as they travel in vacuum tubes at nearly the speed of light until theyâre squeezed enough to, with luck, collide inside a detector. The first hints of the Higgs boson came December 13, 2011. On July 4, 2012, CERN announced that a particle consistent with the Higgs boson had been observed. The Large Hadron Collider creates conditions for particles to collide, but other technology actually detects the impact. In 1968, CERNâs Georges Charpak invented the âmultiwire proportional chamber,â whose principles continue to form the base of todayâs detectors. CERNâs discoveries arenât limited to particle physics. The World Wide Web was conceived in 1989 by CERN scientist Tim Berners-Lee as a way to share information over the Internet. Whatâs the difference between the two? The Internet is the network of hardware that carries information, while the Web is one of the ways to send content through the Internet. Berners-Lee wrote the first Web page, which was about his idea for the Web. The NeXT computer he wrote it on is on exhibit at CERN, with his hand-written warning âThis machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!â CERN also helped develop Internet protocols and was active in keeping the Web free when some companies wanted to charge royalties for its use. Like CERN, Huawei believes in the power of perseverance to discover solutions and answers to connect the world. Delivering world-class ICT solutions to cities and nations around the globe, Huawei today stands as one of the most progressive tech corporations of our time â and always ready to invest the time and energy to blaze new trails in communications technology. Summary:","output":"CERN is a special place where scientists study tiny things called particles to learn about the universe. They use big machines to make the particles go very fast and crash into each other. This helps them understand how everything is made and how it all works together. One day, they found a very important particle called the Higgs boson, which was also called the \\"God particle.\\" It helped them learn more about why things have weight and how everything is connected. This place also made something special called the World Wide Web, which helps us visit websites and find information on the Internet, just like how you're reading this right now."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Instructions: In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options. Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Input: Context: The Battle of Trafalgar (21 October 1805) was a naval engagement fought by the British Royal Navy against the combined fleets of the French and Spanish Navies, during the War of the Third Coalition (AugustDecember 1805) of the Napoleonic Wars (18031815)., Napoleon Bonaparte (\\"Napoléon Bonaparte\\";  , born \\"\\"Napoleone di Buonaparte\\"\\"; 15 August 1769  5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has ensured his status as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history., The French Revolution was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval in France that lasted from 1789 until 1799, and was partially carried forward by Napoleon during the later expansion of the French Empire. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, experienced violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history, triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies. Through the Revolutionary Wars, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history., The War of the Third Coalition was a European conflict spanning the years 1803 to 1806. During the war, France and its client states under Napoleon I, defeated an alliance, the Third Coalition, made up of various German states, Russia, and others., In the War of the Sixth Coalition (March 1813  May 1814), a coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Sweden, Spain and a number of German states finally defeated France and drove Napoleon into exile on Elba. After the disastrous French invasion of Russia of 1812, the continental powers joined Russia, the United Kingdom, Portugal and the rebels in Spain who were already at war with France., The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories., Captain Robert Redmill CB ( c. 1765 -- February 1819 ) was a British naval officer who served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars . He commanded Polyphemus during the Battle of Trafalgar . Although he was late into the action , he gained much acclaim for saving the battered Victory from sinking in the storm which followed the action ., The Treaty of Amiens temporarily ended hostilities between the French Republic and Great Britain during the French Revolutionary Wars. It was signed in the city of Amiens on 25 March 1802 (Germinal 4, year X, in the French Revolutionary calendar), by Joseph Bonaparte and the Marquess Cornwallis as a \\"Definitive Treaty of Peace\\". The consequent Peace of Amiens lasted only one year (18 May 1803) and engendered the only period of general peace in Europe between 1793 and 1814. Under the treaty, Britain recognised the French Republic; the British parliament had dropped England's historical claim to the now-defunct French Kingdom only two years previously. Together with the Treaty of Lunéville (1801), the Treaty of Amiens marked the end of the Second Coalition, which had waged war against Revolutionary France since 1798., The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. , The War of the Fifth Coalition was fought in the year 1809 by a coalition of the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom against Napoleon's French Empire and Bavaria. Major engagements between France and Austria, the main participants, unfolded over much of Central Europe from April to July, with very high casualty rates for both sides. Britain, already involved on the European continent in the ongoing Peninsular War, sent another expedition, the Walcheren Campaign, to the Netherlands in order to relieve the Austrians, although this effort had little impact on the outcome of the conflict. After much campaigning in Bavaria and across the Danube valley, the war ended favourably for the French after the bloody struggle at Wagram in early July., Subject: robert redmill, Relation: conflict, Options: (A) battle of trafalgar (B) british empire (C) french invasion of russia (D) french revolution (E) french revolutionary wars (F) napoleonic wars (G) walcheren campaign (H) war of the fifth coalition (I) war of the sixth coalition (J) war of the third coalition Output:","output":"(A) battle of trafalgar"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite frequent security warnings about potential terrorist threats, the Sinai Peninsula remains a popular destination for tens of thousands of Israelis who enjoy the beach resorts and natural beauty of the area. The Israeli government's concern for the safety of its citizens has only been heightened by recent revelation of the Hamas plot.

Their friendship is put to the test when their families hold opposing views on how to deal with the town's criminal underworld. Marion's family believes in struggling against it, advocating for a fair and just society, while Terry's family is actively involved in the criminal activities. During their teenage years, Marion and Terry become more distant as they choose different paths; Marion joins a local activist group working to rid the town of crime, and Terry becomes entangled in his family's criminal operations. Act 2: Power Struggle As adults, Marion and Terry become influential figures in the town - Marion as a respected community leader and Terry as a feared mob boss. The tension between them reaches a boiling point, as Terry's criminal organization begins to attack the activist group led by Marion. Marion's group works tirelessly to eradicate the crime in the town, which puts a significant dent in Terry's profits and control. This leads Terry to become increasingly ruthless and unforgiving, resorting to extreme violence in order to hold onto his power. Act 3: The Turning Point Terry's actions begin to go too far when he orders the execution of a member of the activist group who is close to Marion. Enraged and heartbroken, Marion decides that enough is enough, and starts plotting to take down Terry once and for all.

While attending my MOS AIT in the US Army (good lord, was that 25 years ago???), a few of us had a hotel party. It didn’t get too crazy as it was mainly to get off post. If I remember right, after some folks left, there was one couple, a couple girls (maybe 3?), and myself who stayed over. I had known them all for a month or so and had spent a ton of time hanging out at the barracks or around the school area. The couple took one bed, the girls took the other, and I took the floor at the foot of the girls’ bed. About the time everyone started to nod off, one of the girls woke me, asking if I would share the blanket, as the bed was too crowded. She and I had both recently gotten engaged to people two plane flights away and had been nothing more than friends previously - with no hint of anything else… I thought nothing of it and said sure. After a few minutes, she said she couldn’t sleep and asked if she could snuggle up a little. I thought nothing of it and said sure. I started to think… hunh… this is peculiar… After a few more minutes, she asked if I minded if we kissed a little. At that point, I started to get the idea… but that was as far as I thought anything was going to happen as I thought, hunh, OK, maybe she misses her fiance. I know I do. Then we progressed to (very quiet) sex at her request. As far as we knew, everyone else in the room was asleep - at least they never hinted at knowing. We dated another month or two while we were both there. I was so clueless as to how she felt and it took FAR too long to figure out what was happening. Why did the girl want to kiss?  A. not enough information  B. she missed her fiance  C. she felt alone  D. she was interested in the author","output":"Based on the story you've shared, it appears that the girl wanted to kiss for a combination of reasons, suggesting that a single answer might not be entirely accurate. Here is a detailed breakdown for each option: A. Not enough information: Although the story provides some context for their relationship, it is true that we don't have complete information about her emotional state or motivations. B. She missed her fiance: This could be a factor in her actions. Being away from her fiance might have contributed to her feeling lonely, prompting her to seek comfort and intimacy with the author. C. She felt alone: This is another plausible reason. As mentioned earlier, both individuals were feeling the distance from their respective partners which might have been a catalyst for their encounter. Seeking companionship and closeness to cope with feelings of loneliness is a common reaction in such circumstances. D. She was interested in the author: While it wasn't explicitly stated in the story, it's possible that the girl had a developing interest in the author. Her requests to snuggle up and eventually engage in sexual activity could indicate a desire to explore her feelings for him beyond their initial friendship. Taking the context into account, it can be concluded that the girl's desire to kiss could have been influenced by a combination of factors: missing her fiance, feeling alone, and being interested in the author. Since we cannot determine the exact thought process or intentions behind her actions, it is challenging to assign one definitive reason for her decision to kiss. However, it is evident that both the girl and the author were in emotionally vulnerable positions due to their distance from their partners, which likely contributed to their intimate encounter that night."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which country caused the formation of fewer dead zones?  Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste.

UPDATE: Gunman Was \\"Despondent\\" Over Being Kicked Out of Band, Had 100 Rounds of Ammo      The two dead bandmates, 28-year-old Arash Farazmand and 27-year-old Soroush Farazmand, were members of the Yellow Dogs, a post-punk band from Tehran that moved to Brooklyn after appearing in a film about the underground music scene there, the group's manager, Ali Salehezadeh, said.      The third man killed, 35-year-old Ali Eskandarian, was a musician from Iran but was not in the band, according to Salehezadeh. A fourth shooting victim was shot twice in the arm but is expected to survive.      Police said the 29-year-old gunman, Ali Akbar Mohammed Rafie, was upset because he had been kicked out of another band, the Free Keys, last year. It wasn't immediately clear why Rafie opened fire on members of another band, although musicians in both groups knew each other and some lived in the same building, Salehezadeh said.

Responding officers found the three dead victims on the second and third floors of one apartment; Eskandarian and Arash Farazmand had been shot in the head, and Soroush Farazmand had been shot in the chest.      Law enforcement officials said Rafie first started shooting from outside the apartment building, when he climbed down from the roof to a third-floor terrace and opened fire through a window, shooting Eskandarian in the head.      Rafie then shot Arash Farazmand in the head in a third-floor bedroom and Soroush Farazmand in the chest in a second-floor bedroom while he was on a bed using his laptop computer, police said.      An unidentified tenant was hit in the arm before Rafie and his former bandmate from Free Keys struggled over the gun until the clip fell out, police said. Rafie put the clip back in the rifle, went back to the roof and shot himself in the head.      Two other people were in the apartment at the time of the shooting, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. They were affiliated with the U.S. Coast Guard and were in town for the Veterans Day Parade.      Rafie's body was found on the roof of the building. Law enforcement officials say he shot himself in the chin, and the .308-caliber assault rifle used in the slayings was found next to his body. It wasn't clear how many shots had been fired.      Authorities were still sorting out the motive and relationship between the shooter and victims.      Kelly said the gun used in the slayings was manufactured out of the country and purchased in upstate New York in 2006.      The band came to the United States to pursue its dream of playing rock music in an open society, Salehezadeh said.      \\"You can't be a rock star in Iran,\\" he said. \\"It's against cultural law.

On one, investigators found an empty guitar case, which they believe was used to transport the assault rifle he used in his attack.      He found his way to a third-floor landing of the home.

His brother, who was also in the room, was not injured.      The other members of the Yellow Dogs, Koory Mirz, the bassist, and Siavash Karampour, the lead singer, known as Obash, were not there at the time.      Photo      Before fleeing for the United States in 2010, the four bandmates belonged to Tehran’s “small but crazy” underground club scene, according to a State Department cable written in 2009 and later released by WikiLeaks.      Supported by their well-educated, professional-class parents, the young men pursued popular music despite official prohibitions. They told American officials that they were drawn to American music because it “spoke to them more viscerally about conditions they faced in Iran than traditional Persian music did.” They began performing publicly in high school, and there were several occasions, they told the Americans, when the police raided their closed concerts, which were held in soundproof basements or warehouses.      The Free Keys were part of the same scene: Both bands played “strictly forbidden underground gigs” together in a Tehran parking lot where young men and women moshed together, according to several websites.      American consular officials who interviewed the Yellow Dogs in Istanbul, where they applied for short-term visas to travel to the United States with the goal of emigrating permanently, said the men, who sing in English, were “astute, well-informed and resourceful 20-somethings” conversant in American popular culture and skillful at video games. By 2009, they had been interviewed on CNN; not long after, they appeared in “No One Knows About Persian Cats,” a film about Iran’s underground music scene.      A State Department official who helped the musicians leave Iran said they had originally applied for a short-term visa to play at South by Southwest, the music festival in Austin, Tex. Arriving in the United States in January 2010, they moved to Brooklyn and applied for political asylum, citing their lack of freedom for political expression. They were granted asylum last year. In Iran, they felt “a lot of pressure, a lot of heat,” said the official, who, not being authorized to speak publicly, spoke anonymously.

The residents saw themselves as an artists’ collective, holding house parties with of-the-moment music and cheap beer for musician friends and hosting exhibitions of friends’ artwork. Mr. Sadeghpourosko’s artwork covered the walls of the living room, which the Yellow Dogs used as a practice space.      They were a familiar sight on their quiet street, where small apartment buildings abut warehouses, often skateboarding or biking around with a dog. Neighbors noted their long hair and tight jeans, the young people of mixed ethnicities streaming into the building for parties, and the music that poured out.      Humble and eager to learn, they arrived early to gigs in their van and stayed late, mixing with fans. And though they sometimes spoke Farsi to one another and a few of their songs had politically potent lyrics, on stage they were like any indie band. “When you close your eyes, you just listen to the music, they sound very much like a regular band,” except for Mr. Karampour’s “exotic” vocals, said Jify Shah, the owner of Cameo Gallery, where the band often played.      Their house had also become something of a hub for Brooklyn’s Iranian expatriates, who often received invitations from the band members to come over for Iranian food, said Rahill Jamalifard, a member of another Iranian band. When the Yellow Dogs arrived in New York, the band had stayed with another Iranian band, Hypernova, which had left Iran before the Yellow Dogs, and the Yellow Dogs extended the same hospitality to members of the Free Keys.      At first, it seemed that the Free Keys would slip into Brooklyn’s music scene as easily as the Yellow Dogs had; they shared a rehearsal space and a manager, Ali Salehezadeh, who hoped the Free Keys’ story of music under political duress would resonate as the Yellow Dogs’ had. But it soon became clear that the band needed work, a friend of the band said, and that the Free Keys liked to party hard. They lacked the Yellow Dogs’ entrepreneurial spirit and ambition, the friend said.      Those in the know believed the Yellow Dogs were ascendant, ready for a national tour or even a record deal. “Everyone knows it’s only a matter of time and the Yellow Dogs are going to be huge,” said Ishmael Osekre, a Ghanaian musician who had booked the band for several shows. “That is why my heart is so broken — the idea that you left friends and family and love, and then for it to end in the way that it has, is just so unfair.” ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The article discusses a tragic incident where Ali Akbar Mohammed Rafie, a musician associated with the acclaimed indie band the Free Keys from Iran, shot and killed three people before taking his own life. The victims included two members of the post-punk band the Yellow Dogs, which was also from Tehran and had moved to Brooklyn, and a third Iranian musician unrelated to the band. The shooting occurred in a Brooklyn apartment, and the shooter later turned the gun on himself on the roof of the building. The shooter was allegedly upset at being ousted from the Free Keys, and had had a petty conflict with the victims, leading to them not being in contact for several months.   The Yellow Dogs were known for pursuing their dream of playing rock music in an open society, this dream is unable to flourish in Iran due to the country's cultural laws against such activities. The band's manager Ali Salehezadeh expressed his sorrow over the situation, reminiscing on the band members who were known to be great kids that people loved and their previously held aspirations to be known for their music - saying, now they won't get to do that. Police investigations revealed that the .308-caliber assault rifle used was purchased in upstate New York in 2006 and had been manufactured outside the country.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Hugo Gye. PUBLISHED:. 09:01 EST, 27 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 09:01 EST, 27 February 2013. A popular punk rocker has told of his shock at catching a tapeworm which burrowed into his brain and had to be removed in a major operation. Jay Whalley, lead singer of Australian group Frenzal Rhomb, feared he had cancer after suffering two seizures on his way to a gig. After the growth in his brain was removed, he discovered that it was an egg from a pork tapeworm - but since he is a vegetarian, he was baffled as to how the parasite entered his body. It later emerged that the tapeworm had apparently come from a vegetarian burrito which Mr Whalley had eaten in Central America which had been contaminated by the person who cooked it. Scar: Jay Whalley's head after the singer underwent surgery to remove a cyst from his brain. The 40-year-old singer has released eight albums with Frenzal Rhomb, one of Australia's leading punk groups. Along with his bandmate Lindsay McDougall, Mr Whalley used to present a radio show on station Triple J. The rocker took to Facebook yesterday to post a comprehensive 1,000-word account of his ordeal after catching the parasite. He said that his first hint of health problems came on February 25, when he started feeling unusual and having difficulty seeing. After he failed to recognise the coins he was holding in his hand, a friend stepped in and made sure he was safe while he endured two seizures. Agony: Mr Whalley, pictured performing last year, suffered two seizures after catching a tapeworm. Mr Whalley was taken to hospital, where doctors gave him a brain scan and discovered a 1cm object which appeared to be a tumour. 'Worst case would be a malignant melanoma, the best would be a benign tumour or an infection of some kind,' he later wrote. However, when he was operated on three weeks later, he was relieved to be told that the growth was not a tumour but a cyst. Doctors later told him he had been infected with Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, during a trip to Central America, despite the fact that he does not eat meat. Surprise: Mr Whalley was afflicted with the pork tapeworm despite being a vegetarian. Taenia solium, known as the 'pork tapeworm', is native to pigs as well as humans. It lives in the intestines, and is usually caught by pigs when they eat human faeces contained the worm's eggs. The most common way for people to become infected by T. solium is eating. the meat of an infected animal which has not been thoroughly cooked. The worm can grow as long as seven metres and lives in the intestine for years. Its eggs frequently migrate into muscle and brain tissue, causing. cysticercosis - the formation of cysts which isolate the egg from the. rest of the body. These cysts can cause muscle pain, and when present in the brain induce seizures. Mr Whalley posted a vivid description of the infection process: 'So the tapeworm eggs live in pig flesh (most common in C America but found in loads of other countries too), the pig is killed and the meat undercooked and eaten by old mate. 'Old mate grows a tapeworm in his intestine which eventually produces eggs. Old mate goes to el baño, doesn't wash his hands properly then busies himself cooking my vegetarian burrito. Gross.' Once the egg had made its way to Mr Whalley's brain, his body formed a cyst around it to isolate it, which remained in place for four years. However, when the cyst grew large enough to press on his brain, it caused the debilitating seizures which he suffered last month. The singer now appears to have fully recovered after a period of weakness in hospital following his operation. 'I don't feel like I've retained any deficits from the brain surgery but I guess only time will tell,' he wrote. 'Perhaps the slice will be taken out of my golf swing. My friend Clem thinks I will become racist.' Mr Whalley also joked about possible nicknames based on his experience, including 'Ham Solo', 'Notorious P.I.G.' and 'Oink 182'.","output":"1.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: At a meeting of the Astronomic Club, its president, Professor Barbenfouillis, proposes a trip to the Moon. After addressing some dissent, five other brave astronomers: Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, and Parafaragaramus agree to the plan. They build a space capsule in the shape of a bullet, and a huge cannon to shoot it into space. The astronomers embark and their capsule is fired from the cannon with the help of \\"marines\\" (most of whom are played by a bevy of young women in sailors' outfits). The Man in the Moon watches the capsule as it approaches, and it hits him in the eye.Landing safely on the Moon, the astronomers get out of the capsule (without the need of space suits) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their blankets and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien inhabitant of the Moon, named after one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the six astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.The astronomers run back to their capsule while continuing to hit the pursuing Selenites, and five get inside.

Translate to English English:","output":"I want to make it perfectly clear that, in my opinion, all attempts to link the safety level of railways to the opening of railway markets are nothing more than an excuse to divert the discussion away from the real causes of the accident. In this statement, the speaker expresses their belief that attempts to draw a connection between the safety levels of railways and the opening of railway markets are not genuine. Instead, they view these attempts as a way to shift focus from the actual factors that contribute to accidents on railways. The speaker suggests that these discussions serve as a way to distract people from addressing the true problems that need to be addressed in order to improve railway safety. Railway safety is a critical issue, as it directly impacts the lives and well-being of countless passengers, railway workers, and others affected by rail transportation. There are numerous elements that contribute to railway safety - from infrastructure and maintenance to signaling systems and the training of railway personnel. When discussing railway safety, it is important to focus on these and other relevant aspects in order to identify the root causes of accidents and take appropriate measures to prevent them. On the other hand, the opening of railway markets refers to the process of liberalizing and deregulating the industry, allowing private companies to compete with public operators in providing railway services. Proponents of this approach argue that market competition can lead to improved efficiency, quality of service, and cost-effectiveness. However, opponents may express concerns that opening markets could prioritize profitability over passenger safety or lead to a degradation of working conditions for railway employees. It is crucial to separate discussions of railway safety from those of market liberalization, in order to prevent conflating the two subjects and potentially diverting attention away from the essential question of what practical steps can be taken to enhance safety standards. By focusing on the real factors that contribute to accidents and mitigating those, policymakers, railway operators, and other stakeholders can collaborate to ensure that passengers and employees alike can trust that they are traveling on safe and well-operated transport systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"What converts water into electricity for Europeans?\\" is hydroelectric power plants in the Alps. The Alps play a crucial role in providing lowland Europe with various resources, including drinking water, irrigation, and hydroelectric power. Despite covering only about 11% of Europe's surface area, the Alps supply up to 90% of water to lowland Europe, especially to arid regions and during summer. There are over 500 hydroelectric power plants in the Alps, which harness the energy from Alpine rivers and convert it into electricity. These plants generate up to 2,900 kilowatts of electricity, catering to the energy needs of various cities and regions in Europe. For instance, Milan, a major city in Italy, relies on approximately 80% of its water supply from Alpine runoff. Hydroelectric power plants work by utilizing the gravitational force of flowing or falling water to produce electricity. Water from Alpine rivers is channeled through dams, where it is used to spin turbines connected to generators. As the turbines spin, they generate electricity, which is then transmitted to the power grid and distributed to consumers. This renewable energy source is reliable and sustainable, as the Alps receive a constant supply of water from melting snow and glaciers, as well as from precipitation. As a result, hydroelectric power plants in the Alps remain a vital part of the energy infrastructure in Europe, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and contributing to lower greenhouse gas emissions."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The desk was promptly taken out of the gross room because the  OPTIONS: (1). room was fragile.. (2). desk was fragile..","output":"Option 2: The desk was fragile. The desk was promptly taken out of the gross room because the desk was fragile. As the desk was removed from the room, sunlight glided over the delicate carvings that adorned its weathered surface. It was an antiquity, passed down through generations of the Miller family. It had once belonged to Amelia Miller's great-great-grandfather, who had been a successful merchant in his time. Stories of his wealth, adventures, and his uncanny ability to find the most incredible artifacts from around the world had been passed down from generation to generation. Amelia, a historian by profession, had inherited the desk upon the passing of her grandmother. Its arrival had evoked memories of a much simpler time, when she would pore over books with her grandmother at the very same desk. Even then, Amelia had been fascinated by the delicate carvings, dreaming of the tales that might lie behind them. Now that the desk was in her possession, she was determined to restore it to its former glory. It was a tricky project, especially considering the fragile state of the desk. Time had not been kind to the heirloom, and its ornate detailing had faltered under a layer of grime and decay. Amelia was keen on involving a professional, someone experienced in the art of restoring fragile antiques. She searched for the best restorers in town until she found Margaret, a skilled artisan known for her gentle hands and meticulous attention to detail. Margaret was overjoyed to take on the project. As she carefully examined the frail desk, her fingers traced the intricate carvings, each one speaking to a storied past. The leg of the desk featured an eagle taking flight, a popular motif in the Victorian era. This piece, she estimated, must have been crafted during the late 1800s. However, it wasn't just the history of the desk that intrigued her. Margaret could also sense the deep bond between Amelia and her family heirloom, a connection that went beyond mere ownership. The restorer recognized the love in Amelia's eyes when she spoke about her grandmother's stories and knew that the desk's rejuvenation would mutually enrich their lives. The restoration process commenced in Margaret's workshop, where she meticulously cleaned the wood and applied a gentle concoction of oils and chemicals to remove the grime and protect the desk's aging surface. The more she worked, the more the desk's true colors began to gleam beneath the dirt – rich browns that radiated warmth and comfort, a stark contrast to its initial appearance. Amelia eagerly visited the workshop several times a week, charting the progress of her beloved heirloom. Beneath Margaret's painstaking efforts, the desk's intricate carvings breathed new life – the eagle's wings spread wide, while the detailed floral patterns interspersed with the Victorian symbols seemed to grow and prosper. After weeks of unceasing effort, the final touches were made. Amelia's great-great-grandfather's desk stood once again as a proud testament to her family's legacy. The desk eventually found its way to a special spot in Amelia's study, where she could continue her passion for history and perpetuate the desk's lineage. And so, the desk's journey had come full circle, as the luminous heirloom served to link a family's past, present, and future. From Amelia's great-great-grandfather's adventures to her grandmother's cherished memories, and now to Amelia's burgeoning career, the desk would continue to witness and inspire the stories of the Miller family."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who was described as being very tense at rehearsals? from the following article ?  In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Loop antennas consist of a loop or coil of wire. Loops with circumference of a wavelength or larger act similarly to dipole antennas. However loops small in comparison to a wavelength act differently. They interact with the magnetic field of the radio wave instead of the electric field as other antennas do, and so are relatively insensitive to nearby electrical noise. However they have low radiation resistance, and so are inefficient for transmitting. They are used as receiving antennas at low frequencies, and also as direction finding antennas. What is a loop antenna compared with to determine its beahvior?","output":"A loop antenna's behavior is primarily determined by comparing its physical size, specifically its circumference, with the wavelength of the radio frequency it is designed to operate at. This comparison helps to characterize how the antenna interacts with the electromagnetic fields of the radio waves, its radiation resistance, efficiency, and its applications. We can classify loop antennas into two main categories based on this comparison: 1. Electrically small loop antennas: When the circumference of the loop antenna is small compared to the wavelength (usually, less than 1/10th of a wavelength), the antenna primarily interacts with the magnetic field of the radio wave. These small loop antennas are also known as magnetic loop antennas. Their main advantage is that they are less susceptible to electrical noise, making them suitable for low-frequency receiving applications. Despite this advantage, electrically small loop antennas have a low radiation resistance, which makes them inefficient for transmitting purposes. 2. Electrically large loop antennas: When the circumference of the loop antenna is comparable to or larger than the wavelength (such as half or even full wavelength), the antenna behaves similarly to a dipole antenna, interacting with both the electric and magnetic fields of the radio waves. These antennas are more efficient in terms of radiation and have a wider bandwidth, making them suitable for both receiving and transmitting applications. The behavior of a loop antenna is also influenced by factors like its shape, the type of wire used, and the position of tunable components within the antenna. However, the primary factor that determines its behavior is the ratio of its circumference to the wavelength of the operating frequency. By comparing the loop antenna's size with the wavelength, engineers and radio enthusiasts can better understand its performance characteristics and make informed decisions when designing and using loop antennas for various applications such as communication systems, broadcasting, direction finding, and radio astronomy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Ray Dolezal, a bored Torrance County Deputy Sheriff, is called to the scene of an apparent suicide in the desert. Alongside the body of Bob Spencer is a suitcase containing 500,000.  During the autopsy, they find a digested piece of paper with a phone number; Dolezal, posing as Spencer, calls the number and goes to a meeting, where he is robbed and instructed to meet Gorman Lennox at a restaurant. FBI agent Greg Meeker intercepts Dolezal and informs him that Spencer was an undercover agent. Now that Dolezal has lost the money, Meeker suggests he continue posing as Spencer to recover the money or help arrest Lennox. Dolezal meets Lennox and his wealthy associate Lane Bodine and learns the money is intended for the purchase of unused military weaponry to arm left-wing freedom fighters in South America.  The arms dealers demo the guns for Dolezal and Lennox, but demand an additional 250,000 due to unforeseen expenses; Meeker, unwilling to provide more money, pushes the responsibility on Dolezal, who romances his way into Lane's life so she will attract rich humanitarian donors to fund the deal. Meanwhile, two FBI internal affairs agents suspect Dolezal of killing Spencer and stealing the money. Dolezal is forced to admit to Lane he is not really Spencer, but she agrees to help raise the money because she finds Dolezal a better alternative to the volatile Lennox. Dolezal learns from Noreen, who had an affair with the real Spencer, that he was working with an FBI agent who likely killed him. Noreen runs away at the sight of Meeker and the internal affairs agents grab Dolezal.  Lennox runs the agents off the road; Dolezal flees and returns to Lane.  He discovers Noreen shot dead and a Polaroid of her with Spencer and Meeker. Answer:","output":"Lane"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The art collections of the Palace Museum (Chinese: 故宫博物院; pinyin: Gùgōng Bówùyùan), a national museum housed in the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, are built upon the imperial collection of the Ming and Qing dynasties. This collection was expanded in the 20th century with new acquisitions, transfers from other museums, and new archaeological discoveries.","output":"Yes, it is true that the Palace Museum is located in the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, and its collections are based on the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The text provides an accurate description of the museum and its origins.  The Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City, was originally constructed in the early 15th century during the reign of Emperor Yongle of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). It served as the imperial palace for the Ming and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, during which it was the center of politics and culture in China. Throughout its history, the Palace Museum has housed a vast array of valuable cultural artifacts that were collected, preserved, and treasured by the emperors. The art collections within the Palace Museum are evidently influenced by the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. As the political and cultural center of ancient China, the Palace Museum amassed a vast array of exquisite artifacts, including paintings, calligraphy, ceramics, bronze, jade, and other cultural relics. These items were carefully collected and maintained by the emperors and their officials in order to demonstrate their cultural achievements, power, and prestige. Over the centuries, the imperial collection grew to inestimable size and value, with each dynasty adding their unique influence and artifacts to the collection. The fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 marked the end of imperial rule in China, and the Palace Museum was turned into a public institution in 1925. During the 20th century, the museum's collection was further expanded through new acquisitions from various sources, including transfers from other museums and newly unearthed archaeological discoveries. The Palace Museum continues to be an essential institution in preserving and showcasing China's rich cultural heritage. It is now one of the largest and most densely populated museums in the world, boasting an unparalleled collection of more than 1.8 million pieces of art. The history of the Palace Museum and the story of its transformation from an imperial collection archive to a national museum serve as a testament to the significance of Chinese culture, history, and civilization. In conclusion, the statement regarding the Palace Museum housing a national museum in the Forbidden City is accurate, and its art collections largely originate from the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. This collection has grown over time through new acquisitions, transfers from other museums, and archaeological discoveries, making the Palace Museum a vital institution in representing and preserving China's extensive cultural history and legacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the piece that calls for an intermission after the fourth movement?, using the article: A composer may also respond to a text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Roméo et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the \\"Queen Mab Scherzo\\" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, \\"as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [Symphonie] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work].\\"Mahler expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his Second Symphony, the \\"Resurrection\\", the vocal fourth movement, \\"Urlicht\\", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale. He then abandoned this pattern for his Third Symphony, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone. Like Mahler, Havergal Brian expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Gothic\\". Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's Faust and Gothic cathedral architecture. The Brian First is in two parts. The first consists of three instrumental movements; the second, also in three movements and over an hour in length, is a Latin setting of the Te Deum., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"The name of the piece that calls for an intermission after the fourth movement is Berlioz's \\"Roméo et Juliette\\".

Then he does slip and fall. his teammates","output":"rush to his aid, helping him back onto his feet. As the ice hockey game continues, the most logical next event, based on the situation and the sport's dynamics, would be for the game to resume its normal course. This may involve various events taking place: 1. The player who fell quickly shaking off the fall and rejoining the action: Depending on the severity of the fall, the player may be able to get back up and swiftly return to the game, with his teammates providing support if needed. 2. A possible penalty if an opposing player caused the fall: If the player's fall was the result of an illegal action or a foul committed by the opposing team, the referee could enforce a penalty, giving the team of the fallen player an advantage. 3. A possible pause in the game if necessary: If the fall was severe enough to warrant concern for the player's safety or health, the game may be paused temporarily so that the team's medical staff can evaluate the player's condition. This step is crucial if there is a suspicion of a concussion or any severe injury that may require immediate attention. 4. The player getting substituted: In case the player is injured or unable to continue playing due to the fall, the team's coach will likely call for a substitution to replace the fallen player with another teammate to maintain their on-ice strength and strategy. 5. Teams adapt to the situation: Depending on how the fall affected the situation on the ice, both teams may need to quickly adapt their strategies. This could involve changing up their line combinations, altering their defensive tactics, or ramping up the aggression to gain momentum after the potentially disruptive event. 6. The crowd reacts: Based on the atmosphere in the arena, the crowd's reaction to the player's fall may vary. If the fall was particularly dramatic or the player is a beloved member of the home team, the crowd could erupt in supportive cheers as the player gets back on his feet. In contrast, if the fall was due to an opposing team's foul, the crowd may direct their energy and displeasure toward the opposing team by booing or heckling them. 7. The game resumes: With the initial shock of the fall abated and any necessary adjustments made, the game will proceed as usual. Both teams will continue to compete tenaciously, aiming for victory in the ongoing game. Ultimately, the most logical next event in this situation would involve a momentary disruption to the game's flow as the ice hockey player and his teammates address the fall and evaluate any possible injuries. Following this brief pause, both teams would adapt to the circumstances and resume the intense competition that characterizes a typical ice hockey game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the premise \\"A group of people playing bagpipes.\\" true if \\"A group of people playing bagpipes.\\"?","output":"Your question seems to be a comparison of two identical statements, \\"A group of people playing bagpipes.\\" If we break down and analyze the statements, we can determine if the premise is true. Both statements are: 1. \\"A group of people playing bagpipes.\\" The sentence describes a scenario where there is a group of people who are playing a musical instrument known as bagpipes. Bagpipes are a traditional instrument, most commonly associated with Scotland, though they are prevalent in various cultures around the world. They rely on enclosed reeds fed from a constant reservoir of air provided by the player, who then manipulates the instrument to produce a continuous sound. Now, as both statements describe the same context and directly match each other, the premise can be considered true. A group of people playing bagpipes would indeed be valid as it reflects the same scenario in both statements. In other words, the premise \\"A group of people playing bagpipes\\" is true if considering the statement \\"A group of people playing bagpipes\\" because they both describe the same situation and are identical in their structure and meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Like most deep veins in legs, anterior tibial veins are accompanied by the homonym artery, the anterior tibial artery, along its course. Multi-choice problem: Is it true that is the anterior tibial vein a deep vein? Pick from: (i) no. (ii) yes. The answer is:","output":"(ii) yes. The anterior tibial vein is indeed a deep vein. It is located in the lower leg and is formed by the union of the venae comitantes (accompanying veins) that run alongside the anterior tibial artery. As a deep vein, it plays a crucial role in the circulatory system by returning blood from the lower extremity back to the heart. The anterior tibial vein begins near the ankle joint, where the two venae comitantes join to form a single vein. It then travels upward along the leg, following the course of the anterior tibial artery. As it ascends, the anterior tibial vein receives blood from several smaller veins in the lower leg and merges with other deep veins, such as the posterior tibial and fibular veins, to form the popliteal vein, located behind the knee. As a deep vein, the anterior tibial vein is an essential component of the venous system and is responsible for recirculating blood from the muscles and other tissues of the lower leg. The circulating blood not only provides these tissues with essential nutrients and oxygen, but also helps to maintain body temperature and fluid balance. It is also important to note that deep veins, such as the anterior tibial vein, are more prone to the development of blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) compared to the more superficial veins. This is due to the higher pressure within the deep veins, their location deeper within the body, and their close association with arteries. As such, any issues related to blood flow in the anterior tibial vein, such as inflammation or valve dysfunction, can increase the risk of clot formation, which may lead to serious medical conditions. In conclusion, the anterior tibial vein is a deep vein that plays a critical role in the circulatory system. It is responsible for returning blood from the lower extremity back to the heart, providing crucial nutrients and oxygen to the tissues, and assisting in the maintenance of body temperature and fluid balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Speaking alongside David Cameron at the White House, Mr Obama said it was up to the British people to decide the matter but EU membership was an \\"expression\\" of the UK's global influence. The PM said his plan to renegotiate the UK's EU membership with a referendum by the end of 2017 had \\"strong support\\". Mr Cameron's strategy has faced criticism from some in his party. Ahead of his White House talks Mr Cameron rounded on senior Conservatives wanting to leave the European Union, accusing them of \\"throwing in the towel\\" before negotiations had even started. He called the position held by former cabinet ministers Lord Lawson and Michael Portillo \\"very, very strange\\". Seventy MPs have now backed calls for a vote on an EU referendum on Wednesday. The US president was asked about the growing number of senior Conservatives openly discussing the prospect of the UK leaving the EU and what this would mean for UK-US relations. By James LandaleDeputy political editor Q&A: Tory row over an EU referendum He told reporters that Mr Cameron's \\"basic point that you probably want to see if you can fix what is broken in a very important relationship before you break it off - that makes some sense to me\\". The US had a \\"special relationship\\" with the UK and an \\"active, robust, outward-looking\\" Britain that was \\"engaged with the world\\" helped underpin this partnership, he suggested. \\"The UK's participation in the EU is an expression of its influence and its role in the world as well as obviously a very important economic partnership,\\" he added. Mr Obama said he awaited the outcome of \\"tough negotiations\\" about the EU's future with interest, noting that the PM had been \\"very active\\" in pushing for structural reforms. He also said he strongly supported a free trade deal between the EU and the US - discussed by the two leaders. Mr Cameron said his European policy was driven by the national interest and he strongly believed that changing the UK's status within the EU was \\"achievable\\". He said holding a referendum now, as some of his MPs are demanding, would amount to a \\"false choice\\" between the status quo and withdrawal. \\"That is not a choice the British people want or deserve,\\" he added. The PM's US trip comes as MPs have signed an amendment to the motion welcoming the Queen's Speech, in which they express \\"regret\\" about the absence of legislation paving the way for a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. There has been a growing number of Conservatives calling for a firming up of the PM's pledge to renegotiate the UK's relations with the EU and to put membership to the public in a referendum by the end of 2017 if the Tories win the next election. Others have gone further, with former cabinet minister Lord Lawson saying any gains from the renegotiations would be \\"inconsequential\\", while ex-defence secretary Michael Portillo has also advocated leaving the EU. Mr Cameron said: \\"The point I would make to these people is that you shouldn't give up before a negotiation has started. \\"It seems to be an extraordinary way to go about things... the idea of throwing in the towel before the negotiations even started, I think, is a very very strange opinion.\\" On Sunday Education Secretary Michael Gove and Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond said they would vote to leave the EU if there were a referendum now, a position echoed by ex-Scottish secretary Lord Forsyth on the BBC's Daily Politics on Monday. Asked about their comments, Mr Cameron said: \\"Well there isn't going to be a referendum tomorrow so it's a hypothetical question.\\" The prime minister has said he would campaign to stay within the EU if he was able to secure a new relationship. A group of Conservative backbenchers, led by John Baron, has been campaigning for him to legislate in the current Parliament for a referendum. The Commons amendment is highly unlikely to be passed, because Labour, the Lib Dems and many Conservatives will vote against it or abstain. But Tory MP Gavin Barwell, one of five Conservative ministerial aides so far to say they will vote for the amendment, said he \\"completely trusted the PM\\" but the electorate did not trust politicians in general. \\"What we need to do is to convince a sceptical electorate that we actually mean it,\\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \\"A very effective way of doing that would be to bring forward legislation, so we can go back to our constituents and say, look if you vote Conservative at the next election here is a guarantee that we will get a referendum.\\" But pro-European Conservative MPs have hit back, with Robert Buckland urging his colleagues to refrain from \\"irrelevant and arcane arguments\\" and to leave the prime minister to \\"get on with the job\\" of defending UK interests. And Nicholas Soames said a future decision on the UK's relationship with the EU should be decided by an \\"orderly process\\" and not by \\"prejudice or pub rhetoric\\". Labour opposes the decision to announce a referendum four years early, but is not ruling out the possibility of one in the future. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said the economy, not Europe, was the \\"biggest problem\\" facing the country but a group of Labour MPs and peers, including the former Europe minister Keith Vaz, are calling for their party to support a referendum. Lib Dem leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has criticised his larger Conservative coalition partners for their \\"endless navel-gazing over Europe\\", which he said was in danger of distracting the government from its priorities. The leader of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, told the BBC's Daily Politics that he was \\"open minded\\" about backing at the next election some Conservative or Labour MPs who wanted UK withdrawal from the EU. He said there had already been some talks with individual local associations, now it was lawful for candidates to have two parties' logos on their ballot papers.

I know that the answer to the question \\"In 1784, what major event in the country had just seen its close?\\" is in \\"Beginning the Age of Revolution, the American Revolution and the ensuing political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century saw the Thirteen Colonies of North America overthrow the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain, and then reject the British monarchy itself to become the sovereign United States of America. In this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the Parliament to govern them without representation, and formed self-governing independent states. The Second Continental Congress then joined together against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the American Revolutionary War (also called American War of Independence).\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The major event in 1784 that had just seen its close was the American Revolutionary War, also known as the American War of Independence. This war took place between 1775 and 1783 and marked a significant turning point in history, as it led to the establishment of the United States of America as an independent nation, separate from the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain and the British monarchy. The American Revolution stemmed from growing resentment and tensions between the Thirteen Colonies of North America and the British government. The colonies sought to reject the authority of the British Parliament, as they felt they were being governed without proper representation in the decision-making process. In response to these grievances, the colonies formed self-governing independent states, united under the banner of the Second Continental Congress. This led to armed conflict with Great Britain, as they took up arms to defend their right to self-governance and fight for independence. Throughout the war, the colonists faced numerous challenges and setbacks. However, with the assistance from foreign allies such as France, they were able to ultimately secure their independence. The war officially came to an end in 1783 with the signing of the Treaty of Paris, which recognized the sovereignty of the United States of America and established the nation as separate from British rule. In summary, the major event in 1784 that had just seen its close was the American Revolutionary War, a pivotal conflict that resulted in the formation of the United States of America as an independent nation, no longer under the governance of the British Parliament and monarchy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Your doctor can determine if you have a herniated disc and prescribe treatment. Describe your pain to the doctor, including where you feel it. In most cases, your doctor can make a diagnosis of a herniated disk in their office, without invasive diagnostic tests. Even if other tests need to be done, they will not be painful. Make a list of the other conditions you have so that your doctor can rule them out as the cause of your symptoms. For example, osteoporosis can cause similar symptoms. Your doctor will also need to know your family history, as having a family member with a herniated disc increases your risk of having one. Your doctor will feel along your spine to look for painful areas. They will likely ask you to change positions or move around your legs so that they can get a better idea about where your pain is located and how it’s impacting you. While it sounds scary, this is a non-invasive, painless office exam. Your doctor will check how well your reflexes work, as well as your muscle development. They will then check your balance and posture. Finally, they will check to see how well you feel sensations like pinpricks, touch, or vibration. The results will help the doctor determine if you may have a disc putting pressure on your nerves. A herniated disc can make it harder for your nerves to communicate with the rest of your body, so your body may have trouble registering pain or may get too many pain signals. The doctor will ask you to bend and move side to side at your joints. This will allow the doctor to see how limber you are and if you are able to move freely and without pain. If you have a herniated disc, it may affect your range of motion. Your doctor will have you lie back on the table. They will slowly raise your leg until you start to feel pain. If you have pain while your leg is at a 30 to 70 degree angle, then you may have a herniated disc. Additionally, if you feel pain in the other leg, it could mean you have sciatica caused by a herniated disc. This test may not be accurate if you are over the age of 60. If your doctor is not sure that your symptoms are caused by a herniated disc, they may do an X-ray to rule out other health issues, such as a broken bone or a tumor. Herniated discs will not show up on an X-ray.  The doctor can use an X-ray to look for pressure on your nerves and spine by injecting a dye into your body. This is called a myelogram. While the pressure on your nerves and spine could be caused by other conditions, it will help your doctor determine if you have compression on your nerves. Your doctor may also take a computerized tomography (CT scan), which takes a series of X-rays to create a more thorough image for the doctor to assess. An MRI lets your doctor get a closer look at your spine so that they can treat your herniated disc. Not only can they confirm the location, they can also determine how severe it is. While you will need to be still, the MRI will not be painful. Usually, you will not have to undergo nerve tests. Your doctor may do these outpatient tests if they suspect you already have nerve damage, based on your reported levels of pain. Although the tests are not painful, they may make you a little uncomfortable. An electromyogram and a nerve conduction test will send electrical impulses to your nerves to see how well they respond. This lets your doctor look for damage to the nerves.","output":"This article discusses the diagnosis process of a herniated disc, detailing the various non-invasive tests and examinations a doctor can perform in their office, including physical examination, checking reflexes, range of motion, and sensation tests; and detailing the further diagnostic tests such as X-rays, myelograms, CT scans, MRIs, and nerve tests if necessary to confirm a herniated disc or rule out other conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The father of a young man killed in a poignant Leicester city centre street attack has come forward, making an emotional appeal for help and assistance to catch the person responsible and bring justice to his family. As a community comes together in search of answers, the case sheds light on the broader social issues of public safety and the importance of vigilance. A Plea for Help The grieving father, whose identity has been kept anonymous to protect his family's privacy, has made a public plea, urging anyone with information to come forward and provide assistance in solving the tragic mystery behind his son's death. In an age where social media and community action can elicit leads and breakthroughs in such cases, sharing his appeal carries the potential to generate crucial information that could be the key to delivering justice. The Incident The street attack, which occurred in the busy city centre of Leicester, saw the young man lose his life in a brutal act of violence. Little has been disclosed, including the man's age or the circumstances of the assault, underscoring the need for further information and investigation. While local law enforcement is doing its best to piece together the sequence of events that led to the tragedy, it is believed that several individuals could have crucial information vital to identifying the perpetrator. The Importance of Public Assistance Street crime often affects not only the direct victim but the entire community, leaving behind a trail of fear, sadness, and confusion. In this case, the young man's untimely death raises uncomfortable questions about the safety and security of the city that many call home. The willingness of the public to assist with investigations can provide invaluable support to law enforcement, who often face daunting challenges in trying to solve crimes. By coming forward with relevant information, community members effectively take a stand against violent crime and contribute to creating a sense of security that benefits the entire community. They assist in bringing some semblance of closure to affected families, whose stories become more than mere statistics in the broader discourse on crime and safety. Addressing the Broader Issue of Public Safety As this tragic situation unfolds, the community in Leicester City Centre is undoubtedly grappling with myriad feelings, from shock and disbelief to concern for their own well-being. Although it's vital to address and prevent street crime, such incidents also serve as a harsh reminder of the broader challenges society faces when it comes to ensuring public safety.

Addressing these underlying issues is paramount to preventing such heartbreaking tragedies from recurring. Conclusion As the father of the young man killed in the Leicester city centre street attack urges help to catch his son's killer, his appeal is a stark reminder of the anguish and heartache faced by those left behind in the wake of violent crime. For a community and its members, the importance of cooperating with law enforcement can never be overstated.

They seem to be deep in a conversation about current events and politics. Mary is holding a newspaper in her hands and occasionally glancing down at an open laptop on the table, while Tom is listening intently. Mary: You know, Tom, I think it's really important to be well-informed about what's happening in the world, especially in times like these. Don't you agree? Tom: Absolutely, Mary! I try to keep up with the news as much as possible, but it's quite overwhelming with so much happening every day. Mary: Well, it's essential to get information from multiple sources. Sometimes the news we read and watch can be very biased, and it's up to us to critically think about and evaluate the information presented to us. Tom: I understand. I usually just read the headlines of the main articles on my favorite news website. Do you think that's enough? Mary: (shaking her head) No, Tom. That's not enough. Reading only the headlines isn't a comprehensive way to understand an issue. Headlines can be sensationalized to grab attention, and they don't always accurately represent the content of the article. And relying on just one source is likely to give you a skewed perspective on what's going on. Tom: Hm, that makes sense. But how can I make sure I'm getting a balanced view on things? Mary: It's quite simple, Tom. You must read more than one article. Try reading articles from different sources and viewpoints. This will help you understand the nuances of each subject, and even if you don't necessarily agree with a particular perspective, it's important to be aware of it. Tom: I never really thought about it that way. So, I should diversify my sources of information and read multiple articles on the same topic to better understand it? Mary: Exactly! Not only will this give you a broader understanding of the issue, but it will also help you develop your critical thinking skills. And in the age of misinformation and fake news, those skills are more crucial than ever. Tom: You're right, Mary. From now on, I'll be more proactive in seeking out varied sources of information and reading multiple articles to deepen my understanding of current events. Thanks for the advice! Mary: You're welcome, Tom! I'm glad I could help. Remember, staying well informed isn't just about the quantity of information you consume, but also the quality. Keep that in mind, and you'll have a greater grasp of the world around you. As Mary and Tom continue their conversation, they engage in a deeper discussion about various news sources and how to critically analyze the information they present.

Q: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Britain has tried to block the release of US ‘torture files’ that could prove how the Blair Government was complicit in the capture and ill-treatment of dozens of terror suspects, it was claimed last night. US Senators are within weeks of publishing a top-secret report on America’s torture and rendition programme carried out in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The 6,300 files will expose the horror of the CIA’s waterboarding and other tortures and could also reveal the extent of British co-operation in the programme. Claims that Britain has put pressure on the US to halt the release of the documents have emerged in legal correspondence in the case of Abdel Hakim Belhadj, a senior Libyan politician and former opponent of Colonel Gaddafi who is suing Britain over his kidnap and forced return to Libya in 2004. Mr Belhadj is relying on intelligence provided by the UK former ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, who says Foreign Office (FO) sources have secretly briefed him about Britain’s diplomatic lobbying against the release of the highly sensitive material. In a letter to the FO, Mr Belhadj’s lawyers say: ‘The report and its executive summary is likely to feature information about [Mr Belhadj and his wife] who in 2004 were held in a CIA black site in Bangkok and rendered in a joint MI6-CIA-Libyan operation to Gaddafi’s Libya.’ They add: ‘It therefore appears HM Government is seeking to dissuade the US Government from disclosing details about our clients’ rendition...’ The true extent of British complicity in torture and kidnap of dozens of detainees has never been fully disclosed. Plight: Abdel Hakim Belhadj is suing Britain over his kidnap and forced return to Libya in 2004. Mr Murray says: ‘Britain has lobbied the US against the publication of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on torture and rendition. 'The lobbying has been carried out “at all levels” – White House, State Department and CIA.’ The FO declined to comment. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article talks about how the UK might have tried to stop the release of some secret files from the US that could show that the UK government, under Tony Blair, was involved in the capture and bad treatment of some people who were suspected of being involved in terrorism.

To do this, add 51*d to both sides: -51*d + 51*d = 757*d - 1616 + 51*d This will cancel out the -51*d on the left side and result in the following equation: 0 = 808*d - 1616 Step 2: Solve for d by isolating the variable. Add 1616 to both sides of the equation to move the constant to the other side: 808*d - 1616 + 1616 = 1616 808*d = 1616 Step 3: Now divide both sides of the equation by 808 to find the value of d: d = 1616 / 808 Step 4: Simplify the fraction: d = 2 So the solution to the equation -51*d = 757*d - 1616 is d = 2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The engagement on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942, in which the HMS \\"Calpe\\" participated, was called Operation Jubilee, more commonly known as the Dieppe Raid. This was a critical assault operation during World War II, conducted mainly by the forces of the United Kingdom, but also included contingents from Canada, the United States, as well as free French forces and elements from other Allied nations. The primary objective of the Dieppe Raid was to test the feasibility of conducting a large-scale amphibious invasion of German-occupied France, gather intelligence, and to boost the morale of the Allied forces. The operation primarily targeted the French coastal town of Dieppe and its surrounding areas. HMS \\"Calpe\\" (L71), a British Royal Navy Hunt-class destroyer (originally designated as an escort destroyer), played a significant role in this operation. The ship provided support to the troops during the amphibious assault, engaging in bombardments on enemy positions and ensuring the safe transport of personnel and resources to and from the shore. Despite the meticulous planning and preparation undertaken by the Allies, the Dieppe Raid turned out to be a costly disaster, resulting in heavy casualties and loss of resources. Approximately 3,623 of the 6,086 men who made it ashore were either killed, wounded, or captured. The failure of the operation led the Allies to reassess their approach to amphibious warfare and directly influenced the planning and execution of the subsequent major amphibious operation – the Normandy Landings (D-Day) on 6 June 1944. The lessons learned from the Dieppe Raid proved to be invaluable in the overarching context of World War II. It allowed the Allies to refine and improve their tactics, strategies, and equipment, making them more effective and ultimately contributing to the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a text based on this summary: health activists demand more money for the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria Text:","output":"In recent times, health activists have been increasingly vocal in their demands for more funding to support the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. As the impact of these three diseases continues to be felt worldwide, the need for financial resources to combat them is more crucial than ever. First and foremost, AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria are three of the most devastating diseases that plague our global society. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), these diseases combined are responsible for millions of deaths each year, with AIDS alone accounting for over 680,000 deaths in 2020. Tuberculosis is not far behind with 1.5 million fatalities, while malaria results in approximately 409,000 annual deaths. Recognizing the severity of this situation, health activists have come together from all corners of the globe to demand that international organizations and governments increase funding allocations to the Global Fund. The Global Fund, established in 2002, is an international financing institution designed to accelerate the end of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria as epidemics. It operates by investing in programs that tackle these diseases in affected regions and enhance the functioning of local health systems. The health activists argue that increased funding for the Global Fund would allow for more extensive efforts and implementation of programs that target several aspects of these diseases, such as prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and support for patients. Moreover, they believe that a more significant financial commitment towards the Global Fund would have a positive economic impact by stimulating productivity, as healthy individuals can contribute more effectively to their societies. In their advocacy efforts, the health activists recommend specific actions, such as increasing international budget contributions, encouraging private sector investments, and collaborating with non-governmental organizations and civil society to pool resources. They also emphasize the need for transparency and accountability in fund management, ensuring that every dollar spent has the maximum possible impact on the ground. In conclusion, the demands of health activists for more funding to support the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria should not be taken lightly. The global community must act in unison to address the devastating consequences of these diseases, and increased financial support for the Global Fund is an essential step in that direction. By combining resources and efforts, it is possible to work towards a healthier and more resilient global population, thus creating a better world for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vaughan Williams dedicated his Seventh and Eighth Symphonies to Barbirolli, whose nickname, \\"Glorious John\\", comes from the inscription Vaughan Williams wrote at the head of the score of the Eighth: \\"For glorious John, with love and admiration from Ralph.\\" Barbirolli did not disdain lighter repertoire. The music critic Richard Osborne wrote that, if all Barbirolli's recordings were to be lost except that of Lehár's Gold and Silver Waltz, \\"there would be reason enough to say, 'Now, there was a conductor!'\\"Barbirolli's repertoire was not as wide as that of many of his colleagues because he insisted on exhaustive preparation for any work he conducted. His colleague Sir Adrian Boult liked and admired Barbirolli but teased him for his meticulousness: \\"We can't all be like you and spend months studying these things and then have days of rehearsals before we conduct them. For some of us they're only sporting events.\\" Barbirolli was shocked by such levity. His approach was illustrated by the care he took with Mahler's symphonies. His biographer Michael Kennedy commented, \\"it is ironical that the effort of composing the symphonies shortened Mahler's life; interpreting them certainly put an enormous strain on Barbirolli in his last decade.\\" He found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years, and he would spend hours meticulously bowing all the string parts in preparation for his performances.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Arithmetic and algebra are examples of what science?\\" is in \\"Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"Arithmetic and algebra are examples of the science of mathematics. Mill's empiricism, as mentioned in your provided passage, raises some significant philosophical issues and questions concerning the nature of reality and the conditions under which groups of permanent possibilities of sensation might exist. However, these philosophical concerns and discussions do not alter the fact that arithmetic and algebra are branches of mathematics. Mathematics is a subject that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, symbols, and abstract concepts. It is a form of reasoning that aims to make precise and logical deductions using a specific set of principles and rules. The science of mathematics is divided into various branches or categories, such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, calculus, and others. Arithmetic is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with the study of numbers and basic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It forms the foundation for more complex mathematical concepts and provides essential skills for everyday life, such as solving problems, measuring, and counting. Algebra, on the other hand, is another branch of mathematics that extends arithmetic by introducing variable symbols, usually represented by letters, to represent unknown quantities or values. It deals with the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating them, focusing on operations such as solving equations and manipulating expressions and functions. Algebra is a powerful tool that helps us understand and solve complex problems involving unknown values and varying relationships. In conclusion, arithmetic and algebra are examples of the science of mathematics, which is a methodical and logical approach to understanding and solving problems related to numbers, symbols, and abstract concepts. While Mill's empiricism offers an interesting perspective on the nature of knowledge and direct experience, it does not change the classification of arithmetic and algebra as branches of mathematics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who is murdered when checking on the disturbed grave? ?  On Christmas Eve 1950, a man named Wilfred Butler, engulfed in flames, runs out of his mansion near the small town of East Willard, Massachusetts. His death is ruled accidental, and the house left to his grandson Jeffrey. Twenty years later in present day 1970, lawyer John Carter arrives in East Willard on Christmas Eve with his assistant and mistress Ingrid, having been charged by Jeffrey Butler to sell the house. Carter meets with the town's leading citizens: Mayor Adams; Sheriff Bill Mason; the taciturn Charlie Towman, who owns the local newspaper; and Tess Howard, who operates the town's telephone switchboard. They all agree to buy the Butler mansion on behalf of the town for the bargain price of 50,000, which Jeffrey Butler requires to be paid in cash the next day. Carter and Ingrid stay the night at the Butler mansion, unaware that they are being watched by an unseen man who has just escaped from a local mental hospital and just arrived in East Willard in a stolen car. After dinner, Carter and Ingrid retreat to a bedroom to have sex. Their unknown stalker enters the bedroom and brutally murders them both with an ax, and then reads from a Bible before placing a crucifix in Ingrid's hand. The killer calls the sheriff, asking him to come investigate Carter's disappearance, and introduces himself as the house's owner. While talking with Tess, who forwards his call, he calls himself \\"Marianne\\". At nightfall, Jeffrey Butler arrives at the mansion to meet with Carter, but finds it locked and empty. He drives to the mayor's home, where he meets Diane, the mayor's daughter. The mayor has gone to the county's bank to obtain the required cash for the payment, so she redirects Jeffrey to the sheriff's office. At the same time, the sheriff is heading to the mansion, but stops at Wilfred Butler's disturbed gravesite, where he finds Butler's diary, then he's attacked and bludgeoned to death with a shovel by the same homicidal madman.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the most logical completion of this news story?. Iran and the United States rang in the Persian new year Tuesday with distinctly different messages for the Iranian people. President Barack Obama slammed the Islamic Republic's crackdown on electronic communications and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that Iran would not hesitate to strike back in the event of an attack on the Islamic republic. The beginning of the year 1391 took Khamenei to the massive Imam Reza shrine complex in the eastern city of Mashhad, where thousands jammed the mosque to hear the nation's supreme leader. Khamenei denied Iran has nuclear capability or that it is trying to develop atomic weapons. But he warned that Iran will defend itself if the United States or Israel attacks -- words that only increase anxiety in Iran's nuclear showdown with world powers. \\"It's the OPTIONS: - Ali Khamenei of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - Barack Obama of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - Imam Reza of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - Iran of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - Iranian of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - Iranians of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - Islamic of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - Islamic Republic of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - Israel of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - Khamenei of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - Mashhad of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - Obama of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - Persian of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - United States of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" - Western of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\"","output":"\\"It's the Islamic Republic of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face.\\" As the new year 1391 commenced, the tensions between Iran and the United States continued to escalate. With President Barack Obama condemning Iran's restrictive measures on electronic communication and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei asserting that Iran would retaliate if attacked, the situation remained volatile. While addressing the thousands of people gathered at the Imam Reza shrine complex in Mashhad, Iran's supreme leader Khamenei denied that Iran possesses nuclear weapons or is attempting to develop them. However, he emphasized the country's determination to defend itself against potential attacks from the United States or Israel. This unyielding position from both sides has amplified concerns regarding Iran's nuclear standoff and strained relations with world powers. As Khamenei points out, the root of the issue lies in the perception of the Islamic Republic of Iran as a persistent thorn in the side of nations seeking to maintain dominance in the region. The unwavering defiance displayed by Iran in the face of external pressure only serves to agitate the situation further, creating an atmosphere of anxiety and uncertainty in regards to potential outcomes.  The implications of this ongoing impasse could be far-reaching, as Iran's nuclear ambitions may prompt other nations in the region to pursue similar objectives for their own security. Furthermore, any potential military confrontation may destabilize an already tense region, adversely affecting geopolitics, economics, and the lives of millions of innocent people. It is clear that the leadership of both countries must work diligently towards fostering dialogue and finding common ground. Peaceful negotiations and open channels of communication present the most viable option for mitigating the risks associated with this escalating conflict. Such efforts may ultimately lead to a resolution addressing the concerns of all involved parties and reducing tensions in the region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Margaret LeAnn Rimes was born in Jackson, Mississippi. She is the only child of Wilbur Rimes and Belinda Butler. The family moved to Garland, Texas when she was six. She was enrolled in vocal and dance classes, and was performing at local talent shows at the age of 5. In January 2005, Rimes released her seventh studio album, This Woman, her first album of contemporary country music in many years. Although the album received mixed reviews from magazines and critics, it was Rimes's best-selling album in over five years, reaching No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on the Top Country Albums chart in 2005, selling more than 100,000 copies within its first week. Rimes explained to the Chicago Sun-Times that the album helped mature her as a person, \\"I have 10 years of experience, so it's tough to get anything past me in this business. I've become a very strong woman because of all I've gone through, good and bad.\\" This Woman would eventually be certified \\"Gold\\" later in 2005, after selling more than 500,000 units nationwide. The album's singles were Rimes's first Top 10 hits on the Hot Country Songs chart in five years. The three singles released from the album--\\"Nothin' 'Bout Love Makes Sense\\", \\"Probably Wouldn't Be This Way\\", and \\"Something's Gotta Give\\"--all peaked within the Top 5 on the country charts between 2005 and 2006. From the album, Rimes was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for \\"Something's Gotta Give\\". In addition, she was also nominated for an American Music Award for \\"Favorite Female Country Artist.\\" In 2006, Rimes recorded a cover version of Barbara Mandrell's \\"If Loving You Is Wrong (I Don't Want to Be Right)\\", for a tribute album to Mandrell's career titled, She Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool: A Tribute to Barbara Mandrell. Rimes also would record a track for Disneyland's 50th anniversary celebration album titled, \\"Remember When.\\"  In summer 2006, Rimes released the studio album Whatever We Wanna, which was released exclusively outside of the United States and Canada. It was originally planned on being released in North America, however due to the success of This Woman, it was never released. The album spawned three singles, \\"And It Feels Like\\", a duet with Brian McFadden titled, \\"Everybody's Someone\\" and \\"Strong\\". The album leaned more towards Pop Rock and R&B music instead of country.

The album was generally well received. Several music critics favorably compared the album to Deal's work with the Pixies, among which were William Van Meter, Rob Sheffield, and Steve Kandell of Spin. Kandell and Sheffield mentioned tracks including \\"Fortunately Gone\\" as superior to songs by that group. Kandell noted Pod appealed to fans of the Pixies' \\"Gigantic\\", which was written and sung by Deal. In AllMusic, Heather Phares described Pod as a \\"vibrantly creative debut\\" that was better than the Pixies' 1990 album Bossanova, and argued that the Pixies should have recorded more of Deal's compositions.The Rough Guide to Rock's Piers Clifton and Melody Maker's Simon Reynolds viewed Pod as lacking energy in comparison to the Pixies' work. To Clifton, it was \\"plodding\\", while Reynolds felt it sounded \\"inhibited, moribund, stilted\\" and \\"never [let] it rip like the Pixies\\". Reynolds added that \\"Whenever a song gathers momentum or thrust, [the Breeders] throw in a weird bit, a gear change or an abrupt stop. They seem unhappy with the idea of simple rock exuberance.\\" Steve Taylor of The A to X of Alternative Music also found Pod inferior to music of the Pixies, but was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar.Some reviews found Pod under-developed or insubstantial. Jon Dolan in Blender likened it to a poorly-constructed building. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice described it unfavorably as more \\"art project\\" than the work of a band, and Greg Sandow in Entertainment Weekly felt the lyrics were sometimes forced.Wif Stenger of Trouser Press called the first side \\"a bit shaky\\" but considered side 2 to be \\"damn near perfect\\". NME's Steve Lamacq described the album as \\"a tight-ish piece of tantalising rock\\", and said that listeners who found it too minimalist would soon warm to it. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times praised Pod's intelligence and originality.

To make things easier for him he chose two elements from the table, element A and element B. Element A has higher electronegativity and element B has lower eletronegativity. David found it easier to learn about elements by comparing their properties.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which element would have increased effect of electron shielding, element A or element B?  Hint: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. The answer is:","output":"Element B would have an increased effect of electron shielding. To understand why, let's first revisit the concept of electronegativity and electron shielding. Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract electrons towards itself in a chemical bond. As mentioned in the hint, electronegativity increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. This is primarily due to two factors: the increase in the number of protons in the nucleus (which leads to a stronger pull on the electrons) and the effect of electron shielding. Electron shielding refers to the phenomenon where inner electrons, or electrons in lower energy levels, shield the outermost electrons from the full positive charge of the nucleus. Due to electron shielding, outer electrons do not experience the full attractive force exerted by the positively charged nucleus. As a result, the outer electrons are less tightly held and are more easily removed from the atom.  Now, considering elements A and B, the main difference between them is their electronegativity values, with element A having a higher electronegativity and element B a lower electronegativity. Based on the general trend in the periodic table, element A would likely be found more to the right and/or higher up in the table, while element B would be found more to the left and/or further down.  Since electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms, element B, having a lower electronegativity than element A, would be situated in an area of the periodic table where electron shielding has a more significant impact. Therefore, element B would have an increased effect of electron shielding compared to element A."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible answers: generous with their time, mean to their sister, heartless A:","output":"In this situation, where Skylar's sister is due to have an operation and requires a babysitter for her child, people's feelings and reactions can vary widely depending on their individual personalities, values, and relationships with Skylar and her sister. Here, we can explore three possible ways others might feel, though these are not exhaustive, and people may experience multiple emotions concurrently or have other, unrelated reactions. 1. Generous with their time: When hearing about the situation, some individuals may find it in their heart to step up and offer assistance. This could make them feel generous as they prioritize the needs of others over their own and choose to allocate their time and effort to help the family cope during a challenging time. They may view the opportunity to provide support as an expression of love, care, and empathy, which are all crucial components of strong relationships. People who feel generous in these circumstances likely have a strong connection to Skylar's sister or Skylar, or simply place a high value on helping others. 2. Mean to their sister: In contrast, some individuals may respond negatively to the prospect of having to take care of a child for Skylar's sister. Factors leading to this reaction may include feelings of jealousy, rivalry, or resentment that has accumulated due to past interactions with the sister. They might be inclined to make hurtful comments or refuse to offer support, which would only further alienate their relationship and create additional tension. This reaction could also be driven by selfishness or a lack of empathy, as they may not fully grasp the severity of the situation, or they may prioritize their own needs over those of their family. 3. Heartless: In a different vein, some people may react indifferently to the situation and display a lack of compassion, empathy, or consideration for the family's predicament. This could result in them appearing cold or heartless, making no effort to offer help or sympathize with the situation. While such reactions might not necessarily be intended to hurt anyone, they can still be damaging to relationships and may speak to a lack of emotional maturity or self-awareness. These individuals might struggle to connect with others on an emotional level, which could, in turn, impact their ability to empathize and form strong, supportive relationships. In conclusion, the way others might feel when presented with Skylar's sister's situation varies widely depending on individual personalities, values, and relationship dynamics. Some may feel generous and willing to lend a helping hand, while others may feel mean and even harbor resentment. Still, others might appear heartless with no regard for the severity of the circumstances. Ultimately, the individual's feelings and reactions are a window into their relationship with the people involved and a reflection of their own values and emotional intelligence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Take action to make sure that your classroom pulses with energy. Start by pumping up your own enthusiasm.   Try not to come to class tired. Get up early in the morning so that you are fully awake by class time. If your students seem lethargic, try having them get up and move around. Even a quick stretch can wake people up. Students might feel more inspiration if they are having fun. Try organizing your lesson around a game. You can adapt this strategy for any age level.  For elementary school kids, you could adapt the common game Simon Says. Students only get to move a step forward if they can correctly answer the math question, for instance. Try a version of Jeopardy for high school or college students. This quiz game is a great way to review for exams. Don't feel like everything has to be a game. They can be used every once in a while to insert some energy into your classroom. Each class is bound to have a few students who are reluctant to participate. However, it is important to make each student feel actively involved in the lesson. Try to get most (if not all) students to participate in activities.  Some students may not like participating in group discussions. You might need to get creative to make it more appealing. Try a lightening round. Set a time limit (maybe 30 seconds) on each question. Make it seem fun and exciting to shout out the correct answer. Technology can be a great way to bring inspiration into your classroom. There are a number of tools you can use to get your students excited about whatever subject you're teaching. Have fun trying new items together!   Many schools provide iPads or tablets for student use. Download some fun math games for your students to play. If you teach a college course, have your history students create entries for educational apps such as Clio. Try to energize your students by taking them out and about. Field trips are an excellent way to inspire and wow your class. Just make sure to tailor the trip to fit the needs of your students.  Try a children's museum for young kids. For example, the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago offers an entire wing of exhibits geared towards children. If you teach high school or college students, try a walking tour. The Freedom Trail in Boston is a great option if you teach in that area.

Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  Bob's parents were in their early 60's. He sent them to the doctor's for a routine check up. Dan, his dad, had very high cholesterol, while Mary, his mom , had normal levels in her blood.

But skeptics said that scoring discrepancies revealed something less than a definitive way of judging a bout., can we conclude that \\"Lewis never got what he deserved as skeptics said that scoring discrepancies did not exist.\\"?","output":"The statement given attempts to claim that \\"Lewis never got what he deserved as skeptics said that scoring discrepancies did not exist.\\" However, the original information provided does not support this conclusion directly. Instead, it presents contrasting views from sportswriters and skeptics about the outcome of a particular bout involving Lewis. To understand this further, let's break down the original statement: 1. Sportswriters exulted that Lewis finally got what he deserved: This part of the sentence suggests that the sportswriters believed that justice had been served, and Lewis received the recognition or victory he deserved. The word \\"finally\\" implies that this might have been a long-awaited or highly anticipated outcome. 2. But skeptics said that scoring discrepancies revealed something less than a definitive way of judging a bout: This portion of the sentence offers an alternate viewpoint from skeptics. These individuals argue that there were inconsistencies or errors in the scoring system that influenced the outcome of the bout. As a result, they believe the judgment of the contest is not definitive, suggesting that they may not agree with the sportswriters' view that Lewis got what he deserved. Considering the original statement, making the conclusion that \\"Lewis never got what he deserved as skeptics said that scoring discrepancies did not exist\\" is not accurate, as it misinterprets the skeptics' stance. The skeptics argue that scoring discrepancies did exist, casting doubt on the bout's judgment, whereas the given conclusion claims skeptics said that such discrepancies did not exist. In summary, the original statement presents two opposing viewpoints regarding the outcome of Lewis's bout. The sportswriters believe that Lewis got what he deserved, while the skeptics assert that scoring discrepancies leave room for doubt and prevent a definitive judgment. Based on the provided information, we cannot determine whether Lewis did or did not get what he deserved; we merely see that there are contrasting opinions surrounding the issue."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Tron: Legacy Movie plot: In 1989, seven years after the events of the first film, Kevin Flynn, who has been recently promoted CEO of ENCOM International, disappears. Twenty years later, his son Sam, now ENCOM's primary shareholder, takes little interest in the company beyond playing an annual prank on its board of directors. Alan Bradley, an ENCOM executive and friend to Sam's father, asks Sam to investigate a strange pager message originating from Flynn's shuttered video arcade. Sam discovers a large computer in a hidden basement, which suddenly teleports him to the Grid, a virtual reality created by his father that exists within ENCOMâs computer mainframe.[6] He is quickly captured and sent to \\"the Games\\", where he is forced to fight a masked program named Rinzler. When Sam is injured and begins bleeding, Rinzler realizes that Sam is a human \\"User\\" and takes him before Clu, the Grid's corrupt ruling program who resembles a younger Kevin Flynn. Clu nearly kills Sam in a Light Cycle match, but Sam is rescued by Quorra, an \\"apprentice\\" of Flynn, who conveys him to his father's hideout outside Clu's territory. Flynn reveals to Sam that he had been working to create a \\"perfect\\" computer system and had appointed Clu and Tron (a security program created by Bradley) its co-creators. During this construction, the trio discovered a species of naturally occurring \\"isomorphic algorithms\\" (ISOs) not conceived by Flynn, bearing the potential to resolve various mysteries in science, religion and medicine. Clu, considering them an aberration, betrayed Flynn, seemingly killed Tron, and destroyed the ISOs. Meanwhile, the \\"I/O portal\\" permitting travel between the two worlds had closed, leaving Flynn trapped in the system. Now that Clu has gained complete control, he sent the message to Alan in order to lure Sam onto the Grid and reopen the portal for a limited time. As Flynn's \\"identity disc\\" is the master key to the Grid and the only way to traverse the portal, Clu expects Sam to bring Flynn to the portal so he can take Flynn's disc, go through...

Hubert Humphrey was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.  Finally, in June 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law.  Humphrey called this his greatest achievement. Lyndon B. Johnson recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the 1964...

Premise: God that's uh that sounds pretty bad to me i mean who would steal a newspaper Hypothesis: newspapers are very, very cheap so why steal one Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise is that someone has stolen a newspaper, and the speaker appears to be in disbelief about the consequences of stealing something as trivial as a newspaper. The hypothesis suggests that newspapers are very cheap, hence questioning the rationale behind stealing one.  To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is important to first understand what entailment means. In logic, entailment is a relationship between two statements where if the premise is true, the truth of the hypothesis necessarily follows. So, does the hypothesis follow from the premise with certainty? In this case, the premise does not seem to entail the hypothesis automatically. The premise describes a situation where a newspaper is stolen and disapproval is expressed over the act. However, it does not explicitly state the cost of the newspaper. The hypothesis introduces the concept of cheapness as the main reason to question the act of stealing a newspaper, which is not present in the premise. That being said, the premise and the hypothesis share a common theme of disbelief about stealing a newspaper. It implies that stealing a newspaper is a petty and unreasonable act with minimal potential gains. In this sense, the hypothesis attempts to explain the underlying reason for the disbelief mentioned in the premise. While the premise does not outright entail the hypothesis, the two statements are thematically linked. The hypothesis provides a possible explanation for the disbelief expressed in the premise, questioning the rationale behind stealing a low-cost item such as a newspaper. However, the relationship is not strictly a logical entailment since the cost of the newspaper is not directly addressed in the original premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - For the system based on the teachings of G. I. Gurdjieff see Fourth Way . The Fourth Way ( 1957 ) is a book about the Fourth Way system of self - development as introduced by Greek - Armenian philosopher G.I. Gurdjieff and is a compilation of the lectures of P. D. Ouspensky at London and New York , 1921 -- 1946 , published posthumously by his students in 1957 . The term \`\` The Fourth Way '' has also come to be used as a general descriptive term for the body of ideas and teachings which Gurdjieff brought to the west from his study of eastern schools . Ouspensky was given the task of bringing these ideas to a wider audience in an unadulterated form by Gurdjieff .

The MP who fiddled the largest sum on her expenses will keep more than £25,000 of a ‘golden handshake’ that other fraudsters were denied. Margaret Moran, 57, cheated taxpayers out of £53,000 by forging invoices and claiming for bogus repairs to her second homes. She was spared jail after a judge agreed she was mentally unfit to stand trial. Instead, Moran received a two-year supervision and treatment order. Now the Commons sleaze watchdog has closed the book on two investigations without taking disciplinary action. The. former Labour MP repaid £6,000 but the authorities will struggle to. claw back any money as she has not been found guilty of any crime.

But instead of going to jail, a judge decided she was not well in her mind and gave her a different kind of punishment, where she has to be watched and treated for two years. Now, the people who make sure everyone follows the rules say they can't do anything more to punish her.

The bank has given 117-million for an \\"immediate help.\\" The World Bank President says the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004 showed how a disease could damage economies. 800 people died from SARS and the economic losses were up to 40-billion. Mr. Kim says SARS and the H1N1 outbreak of 2009 taught that fear and avoidance resulted in about 90-percent of the economic losses. That means the disease is causing two levels of economic damage. \\"There are two kinds of contagion .

Jim Douglas (Gregory Peck) is a rancher pursuing four outlaws after the murder of his wife six months before. He rides into Rio Arriba, where four men, Alfonso Parral (Lee Van Cleef), Bill Zachary (Stephen Boyd), Ed Taylor (Albert Salmi) and Lujan (Henry Silva), are in jail awaiting execution. Sheriff Eloy Sanchez (Herbert Rudley) allows Douglas to see the men. In town, Douglas meets Josefa Velarde (Joan Collins) whom he met five years previously in New Orleans. She has been looking after her late father's ranch. Douglas reveals he has a daughter (Maria Garcia Fletcher). Other townspeople include Gus Steimmetz, his daughter Emma (Kathleen Gallant) and her fiance (Barry Coe). The executioner, Simms, arrives, and aside from a brief drink with Douglas, seems to show little interest in socializing or advance planning for his task. Simms holds off until the town is at church, then, while pretending to evaluate the men he is to hang, stabs the sheriff in the back. The sheriff shoots and kills Simms, but the inmates leave the sheriff unconscious, escape and take Emma as a hostage. The wounded sheriff comes into the church with the news that the prisoners have escaped. A posse rides out immediately, but Douglas waits until morning. The posse is held up at a pass when one of the four fugitives stays behind to cover the pass. Douglas catches up and corners Parral, who pleads for his life. Douglas kills him, then ropes another outlaw, Taylor, by the feet and hangs him upside-down from a tree. The two remaining fugitives reach the house of John Butler (Gene Evans), a prospector and Douglas's neighbor. Zachary kills Butler, after which Lujan steals a sack of coins Butler had. They see riders approaching and flee, leaving Emma behind. It turn out to be Josefa and Douglas, coming from different directions. The posse also arrives and finds Emma, raped by Zachary, in the house. Douglas goes back to his ranch to get fresh mounts, but finds that the fugitives have taken...

While it is tempting to assume that a \\"Man on the beach is throwing a red ball\\" implies that he is playing, we cannot draw a definitive conclusion based on the given information alone. There are several reasons as to why this man might be throwing a red ball on the beach, and each scenario holds different implications about whether or not he is playing. First, consider the possibility that the man is indeed playing a game. He could be engaging in a friendly game of catch with someone else or throwing the ball for a pet to fetch. In this instance, one might reasonably conclude that the man is playing. However, other explanations could also apply. For instance, the man could be participating in a beach cleanup event and was tasked with throwing away any items, including the red ball, that he found littering the beach. In this case, he is not playing but is instead taking part in a volunteer effort to maintain the cleanliness and beauty of the beach. Another possibility is that the man is a professional athlete, such as a baseball or American football player, and he is practicing throwing the ball as part of his training regimen. In this scenario, we would not necessarily consider him to be playing. Instead, he might be working to improve his skills and performance in his chosen sport. Lastly, the man might be throwing the ball as a way to relieve stress or simply to occupy himself. In this case, it would not be accurate to say that he is playing, as there is no game or competition involved. Instead, it could be seen as a form of self-entertainment or even a therapeutic activity. In conclusion, without additional context or information, it is not possible to tell whether the \\"man on the beach is throwing a red ball\\" is playing or engaging in some other activity. There may be various reasons for this action, and determining whether he is playing or not requires a deeper understanding of the circumstances and intentions surrounding the event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but  Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by  Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with  Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000,  Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to  Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why did the team avert from attacking an oil tanker and attempt to attack a warship?\\" is \\"The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras\\"? pick from the following.  *no;  *yes;","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"Why did the team avert from attacking an oil tanker and attempt to attack a warship?\\" is not \\"The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras.\\" The reason the team changed their target from an oil tanker to a warship is because Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S. warship instead.

Given the two facts above, what has special structures for penetrating a host? Available options: - blood - water - sunlight - gills - bacteria - Oak - yeasts - parasites","output":"The option that has special structures for penetrating a host, given the two facts above, is yeasts. This is because yeasts are classified within the kingdom of Fungi, and according to the provided information, Fungi have special structures designed to penetrate a host.  Fungi, in general, have developed intricate ways to invade their hosts for survival and reproduction. They are heterotrophic, which means they cannot synthesize their own food and hence rely on absorbing nutrients from other organisms. To accomplish this, many fungi, including yeasts, use specialized structures such as hyphae, which are thread-like filaments, and haustoria, which are specialized invasive hyphae, to penetrate their hosts' tissues.  Yeasts, in particular, are unicellular fungi that reproduce through a process called budding. When yeast infects a host, like a human, they initially attach to the host cells using adhesins (surface proteins) which help them recognize and bind to specific sugars or proteins on the host cells' surfaces. Yeast can then directly penetrate host tissues or be phagocytosed (engulfed) by the host's immune cells. Inside these cells, some yeast species switch to a multicellular filamentous form that can escape the host cell and invade surrounding tissues. However, it's important to note that not all yeasts are pathogenic. Many yeasts are harmless and exist in our environment without causing any noticeable diseases or infections. Some are even beneficial, playing key roles in ecological systems and human industries. For instance, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the yeast responsible for the fermentation of bread, beer, and wine, has inarguably contributed significantly to human history and culture. In conclusion, based on the given facts, it is yeasts amongst the presented options that have special structures for penetrating a host, as they are part of the fungi kingdom known for this characteristic. This characteristic of penetration allows them to effectively survive and reproduce using their host's resources, although their host-dependent lifestyle can range from being symbiotic to causing damaging infections in their hosts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Just how short a day? Nine hours and 15 minutes of daylight on the East Coast, per Time. The solstice, which happens everywhere on Earth at the same instant, will take place at 11:48pm EST, meaning some parts of the world—including Stonehenge, where there are usually wild solstice celebrations—will experience the solstice on Tuesday.

Expand this summary.","output":"The winter solstice is a significant event that takes place every year, marking the shortest day and longest night for residents of the Northern Hemisphere, who will be tilted as far from the sun as they will be all year. The duration of daylight during the winter solstice varies according to geographical location, but on the East Coast of the United States, for example, there are only around nine hours and 15 minutes of daylight on this day. The winter solstice occurs for everyone on Earth at the exact same instant, but the precise time may vary depending on one's location and time zone. In 2015, the solstice took place at 11:48pm Eastern Standard Time (EST), which means that some parts of the world, such as Stonehenge, experienced it on Tuesday. Due to the imprecise synchronization of the solar year with the modern calendar, the winter solstice can actually occur anywhere between December 20 and December 23, although the latter two dates are quite rare. This period marks the beginning of the astronomical winter for the Northern Hemisphere and the summer for the Southern Hemisphere. However, it should be noted that the winter solstice does not necessarily indicate the coldest part of the year for those living above the equator. In fact, some weather forecasters have predicted that this could be one of the warmest Christmas weeks on record.  From December 22, the days will gradually start to grow longer, as the Earth's tilt slowly begins to change in relation to the sun. However, it will still take some time for the average temperatures to rise, as Earth continues to lose heat at a faster rate than it absorbs it from the sun. Typically, cities in the United States do not begin to experience warmer temperatures until at least the end of January. Throughout history, the winter solstice has been celebrated in various cultures across the world. In the case of Stonehenge, thousands of people gather annually to pay tribute to this astronomical event and to take part in solstice-related rituals and ceremonies.

Summarize the following: Bleaching the knots and or lace helps them blend into the color of your scalp by removing the black dots. Mix equal parts bleach and 20 to 30 volume professional developer in a bowl. Then, turn the wig inside out. Use the applicator brush that came with the bleach to carefully apply the bleach to the lace and knots. Wait about 15 minutes or until the knots turn blonde, then thoroughly rinse the wig out upside down.  Immediately wash the wig with a neutralizing shampoo to stop the chemical process. Then, condition the wig to prevent the material from getting dried out. Allow the wig to air dry. Bleaching the knots will conceal the appearance of the black dots on the lace. Bleaching the knots isn’t only for lighter skin tones. Bleaching should be effective for any skin tone. If the lace doesn’t quite blend in with your scalp or forehead, you can use concealer to color it. Take a concealer that closely matches your skin tone and apply a small amount of it onto a sponge. Use the sponge to blend the concealer into the lace front until it matches your skin tone. Heat styling tools are typically okay to use on real human hair. You can use a flat iron or curling iron to style your hair as desired. Use a low heat setting and only style dry hair so that you don’t cause excess damage to the wig.  To straighten the wig, take a 1 inch (2.5 cm) section of hair and run the heated flat iron from root to tip. Repeat on each section until you’ve straightened all of the hair on the wig. To curl the wig, clamp the curling down on a 1 inch (2.5 cm) section of hair in the middle (between roots and tips). Then, wrap the bottom section of hair around the wand. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds and then let go. Repeat on each section until all of the hair has been curled. If you don’t want to leave the hair down, you can  put it up in a ponytail or bun.  Make a side ponytail by creating a deep part, then brush all of the hair to 1 side. Gather all of the loose hair and secure it with a ponytail holder. Create a top knot by gathering the hair into a high ponytail. Then, twist all of the hair around into a knot. You can secure the bun with bobby pins or a ponytail holder. Make sure the wig looks natural at the nape of your neck. Summary:","output":"Bleaching knots and lace on a wig helps to blend them with the scalp, making them less visible.

Plot title: Circle of Iron Movie plot: The movie begins with a martial arts tournament, in which fighters are competing for the right to begin a quest to challenge Zetan (Christopher Lee), a famous wizard who possesses a special book of enlightenment that is supposed to contain all the world's wisdom. Arrogant brawler Cord (Jeff Cooper) defeats every opponent, but is disqualified for fighting dishonorably. Cord decides to follow the eventual winner Morthond (Anthony de Longis), hoping that he can lead him to Zetan. While the two fighters are resting, a blind flutist (David Carradine) walks by them and into a nearby building. Cord follows the blind man and sees him easily dispatch a gang of thugs who attacked him. Impressed by his fighting skills, Cord asks the blind man to be his teacher. The blind man refuses; Cord follows him anyway, but gets frustrated with the way the blind man teaches his lessons in riddles and they soon part ways. Cord finds Morthond wounded from the first trial. Morthond asks Cord to help him end his suffering and pursue his quest to find Zetan. Cord does, and faces a tribe of monkey men whose leader (David Carradine) is a great fighter. Cord challenges and eventually overcomes the Monkeyman, who then tells him how to find his second trial. On the way, Cord encounters a man in a large cauldron of oil (Eli Wallach), who is attempting to dissolve the lower half of his body. The man is hoping to end his sexual urges to find enlightenment, and invites Cord to join him, but Cord immediately leaves. On his journey, Cord has a vision of Death (Carradine), but dispels the spirit by demonstrating his lack of fear. Cord then comes upon a band of travellers holding a festival. Cord meets with their leader, Chang-Sha (Carradine), who offers to let Cord sleep with one of his wives, Tara (Erica Creer). Cord declines due to his vow of celibacy and instead challenges Chang-Sha to combat. The contest is set for the following day; during the night, Cord is joined in his tent by Tara. They make love, and Cord asks Tara to stay with him... My question: Cord wants to fight Chang-Sha to learn who's location?

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Who is the author?

David Monroe Shoup (30 December 1904 - 13 January 1983) was a decorated general of the United States Marine Corps who was awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II, became the 22nd Commandant of the Marine Corps, and, after retiring, became one of the most prominent critics of the Vietnam War. Born in Indiana to an impoverished family, Shoup joined the military for financial reasons. Rising through the ranks in the interwar era, he was twice deployed to China during the Chinese Civil War. He served in Iceland at the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, and as a staff officer during the Pacific War. In mid-1943, Shoup was transferred to the staff of Major General Julian C. Smith, commander of the 2nd Marine Division, and tasked to help plan the invasion of Betio on Tarawa Atoll. Shoup's aggressive leadership style would complement the offensive strategy his superiors were seeking in taking the atoll. He was tasked with drawing up initial plans, designating the landing beaches on Betio for the 2nd Marines, and overseeing some rehearsals at Efate. However, after Colonel William W. Marshall, commander of the 2nd Marines, suffered a nervous breakdown before invasion, Smith promoted Shoup to Colonel and gave him command of the regiment, in spite of Shoup's lack of combat experience.  The invasion commenced on 20 November 1943, with Shoup disembarking from Maryland, the flagship for the invasion. His force met heavy resistance on the beaches. His LVT was destroyed by shore fire, and he had to proceed without transportation. As he was wading ashore at around 11:00, he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and received a grazing wound from a bullet in the neck. In spite of these wounds, he rallied the Marines and led them ashore. He was able to coordinate the troops on the beaches and organize them as they began to push inland against an anticipated Japanese counterattack. He continuously organized aggressive attacks on the defenders, and was noted for his bravery and vigour during the conflict. On the second day of the attack, he organized an advance inland, despite heavy casualties among the American troops. By the afternoon, they were winning the battle, and reinforcements began to arrive in force. That night, Shoup was relieved by Colonel Merritt A. Edson, the division's Chief of Staff, who commanded the 2nd Marines for the remainder of the campaign. Six years later, Shoup made a cameo appearance in the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\" reprising his actions that first night on Tarawa, although he had originally been brought onto the movie as a technical advisor.  For his leadership during the assault and the push inland Shoup was awarded the Medal of Honor and the British Distinguished Service Order. For his role in planning the invasion he was awarded the Legion of Merit with \\"V\\" device. He also was awarded the Purple Heart for the combat wounds he suffered during the course of the campaign. Ten years after the assault, Shoup remarked of the operation, \\"there was never a doubt in the minds of those ashore what the final outcome of the battle for Tarawa would be. There was for some seventy-six hours, however, considerable haggling with the enemy over the exact price we would have to pay.\\" In 1968, he returned to Tarawa to dedicate a memorial to the battle and to the American and Japanese troops who had died there.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he remain in the service or did he retire after the invasion?","output":"David Monroe Shoup remained in the service after the invasion.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? OPT: [a]. Use white glue on top and bottom of paper.. [b]. Use decoupage glue on top and bottom of paper..","output":"To determine which option is better in terms of naive physics reasoning for sealing paper to cardboard, let's consider the properties and effectiveness of both white glue and decoupage glue in this context. Option [a]: Use white glue on top and bottom of paper. White glue, also known as PVA glue, is a common adhesive used for various purposes, including bonding paper to surfaces like cardboard. When applied to both top and bottom of the paper, it will hold the paper in place and create a relatively strong bond between the paper and cardboard. However, using white glue on the top surface of the paper may cause the paper to ripple, wrinkle, or leave visible marks on the paper, which can be undesirable. Option [b]: Use decoupage glue on top and bottom of paper. Decoupage glue is a glue specifically designed for the art of decoupage, which involves decorating an object by gluing cutouts of paper onto it and then sealing the surface with multiple layers of the same glue. Decoupage glue serves both as an adhesive and a sealant. It dries clear and has a more fluid consistency, which allows it to be applied smoothly and evenly, ensuring fewer bubbles and wrinkles. Applying decoupage glue to the top and bottom of the paper will not only bond the paper and cardboard effectively but also provide a protective layer to the paper, enhancing its durability. Based on the above analysis, option [b], using decoupage glue on top and bottom of the paper, is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning as it provides an effective bond between the paper and cardboard, dries clear, and helps in preventing wrinkles and ripples on the paper."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Paragraph- Sent 1: After the disruption of the plot in Amman, it had not escaped notice in Washington that Hijazi had lived in California and driven a cab in Boston and that Deek was a naturalized U.S. citizen who, as Berger reminded President Clinton, had been in touch with extremists in the United States as well as abroad. Sent 2: Before Ressam's arrest, Berger saw no need to raise a public alarm at home- although the FBI put all field offices on alert. Sent 3: Now, following Ressam's arrest, the FBI asked for an unprecedented number of special wiretaps. Sent 4: Both Berger andTenet told us that their impression was that more Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretap requests were processed during the millennium alert than ever before. Sent 5: The next day, writing about Ressam's arrest and links to a cell in Montreal, Berger informed the President that the FBI would advise police in the United States to step up activities but would still try to avoid undue public alarm by stressing that the government had no specific information about planned attacks. Sent 6: At a December 22 meeting of the Small Group of principals, FBI Director Louis Freeh briefed officials from the NSC staff, CIA, and Justice on wiretaps and investigations inside the United States, including a Brooklyn entity tied to the Ressam arrest, a seemingly unreliable foreign report of possible attacks on seven U.S. cities, two Algerians detained on the Canadian border, and searches in Montreal related to a jihadist cell. Sent 7: The Justice Department released a statement on the alert the same day. Sent 8: Clarke's staff warned, \\"Foreign terrorist sleeper cells are present in the US and attacks in the US are likely.\\"Sent 9: Clarke asked Berger to try to make sure that the domestic agencies remained alert.\\"Sent 10: Is there a threat to civilian aircraft?\\"he wrote. Sent 11: Clarke also asked the principals in late December to discuss a foreign security service report about a  Bin Laden plan to put bombs on transatlantic flights. Sent 12: The CSG met daily. Sent 13: Berger said that the principals met constantly. Sent 14: Later, when asked what made her decide to ask Ressam to step out of his vehicle, Diana Dean, a Customs inspector who referred Ressam to secondary inspection, testified that it was her \\"training and experience.\\"Sent 15: It appears that the heightened sense of alert at the national level played no role in Ressam's detention. Sent 16: There was a mounting sense of public alarm. Sent 17: The earlier Jordanian arrests had been covered in the press, and Ressam's arrest was featured on network evening news broadcasts throughout the Christmas season. Sent 18: The FBI was more communicative during the millennium crisis than it had ever been.  Question: Following Ressam's arrest, which type of wiretap requests were being requested?. Output:","output":"Part 1: An incorrect answer should be closely related to the content of the paragraph and/or the question. Usage: Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) phones wiretap requests. This incorrect answer is closely related to the content of the paragraph, where FISA wiretap requests were mentioned.

Usage: Special wiretap requests for phone lines. This incorrect answer is similar to the correct answer, \\"special wiretap requests,\\" but adds a specific detail (for phone lines) that is not accurate.

Usage: Routine wiretap requests. This incorrect answer prevents those who skip the paragraph from answering the question, as it may seem like a reasonable guess without knowing the context. However, after reading the paragraph, it is clear that \\"routine\\" is not the proper term in this case, as the wiretap requests were described as \\"special\\" and \\"unprecedented.\\" Part 4: The incorrect answer should not be trivial. Usage: Wiretap requests for aliens' communication. This incorrect answer is not trivial, as it is not easily eliminated without reading the paragraph. It slightly connects to the context of foreign threats and surveillance but is not the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a text based on \\"khartoum adamant on darfur atrocities suspects\\" Text:","output":"Title: Khartoum Insistent on Defending Darfur Atrocities Suspects Introduction: In recent developments, authorities in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, remain steadfast in their support for individuals suspected of involvement in atrocities committed in the Darfur region. The government's refusal to hand over these individuals to face international justice continues to spark controversy and highlights the ongoing struggle for accountability in the region. Step 1: Present the background information The conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan began in the early 2000s and has been characterized by large-scale human rights abuses, including mass killings, systematic rape, and widespread displacement. The atrocities committed have been widely denounced by both international and local human rights organizations. Step 2: Introduce the key players Central to the ongoing controversy are key figures in the Sudanese government and military who have been implicated in the crimes. Khartoum authorities maintain, to the dismay of international human rights advocates, that these individuals are not guilty of the acts they have been accused of. Step 3: Explain the government's stance Khartoum's unwavering support for the accused stems from their insistence that the events in Darfur have been misunderstood and misrepresented. They argue that the alleged crimes were committed as part of a broader, complex conflict involving various factions and groups, rather than a deliberate campaign of terror. Step 4: Discuss the implications of the government's stance The Sudanese government's refusal to hand over the suspects has raised concerns among the international community and further complicates the search for justice for the victims of the Darfur atrocities. Critics argue that the government's stance only serves to protect those responsible, while undermining international efforts to hold the perpetrators accountable. Step 5: Highlight the role of international organizations Various international organizations, including the United Nations and the International Criminal Court (ICC), have been working to address the atrocities committed in Darfur. The ICC has issued arrest warrants for some of the main culprits, including former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir. Despite these efforts, Khartoum's adamant position remains a significant obstacle in the pursuit of justice. Conclusion: As the situation in Darfur continues to be a matter of global concern, Khartoum's unwavering defense of the accused serves as a reminder of the challenges faced in addressing large-scale atrocities and achieving justice for the victims. Although international organizations remain committed to upholding accountability, the Sudanese government's stance poses a significant obstacle in this pursuit, thus prolonging the suffering of the people of Darfur."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As he speaks to the men about to embark on their first great adventure, his manner runs the gamut from stern, to jovial, amused, profane and reverent. To Patton, it is obvious that war is the greatest expression of the human condition.North Africa, 1942: In their first encounter with Rommel's Africa Corps, the Americans are badly beaten. In the post-battle assessment, Gen. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) decides what's needed is the best tank commander they've got. Patton answers the call and arrives amid wailing sirens and a cloud of dust. He's also early and catches most of the soldiers off guard, a mistake they quickly learn not to make again. Believing the casual attitude displayed by the troops to be the primary source of their defeat, he quickly begins to set things to rights. Patton's belief in himself is unshakable, and there's only one way to get things done-his way. Quickly establishing discipline and routine, he commands his men with an iron fist. He also has great respect for the Germans he's up against, and has studied the tactics of Rommel in the field.In Berlin, the Germans are also assessing Patton. His reputation is considerable, and they study his idiosyncracies looking for a clue to the man's character.

If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.  - Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet, FRSE (15 August 1771  21 September 1832) was a Scottish historical novelist, playwright and poet with many contemporary readers in Europe, Australia, and North America.  - Absentee landlord is an economic term for a person who owns and rents out a profit-earning property, but does not live within the property's local economic region. The term \\"absentee ownership\\" was popularised by economist Thorstein Veblen's book of the same name, \\"Absentee ownership\\".  - Maria Edgeworth (1 January 1768  22 May 1849) was a prolific Anglo-Irish writer of adults' and children's literature. She was one of the first realist writers in children's literature and was a significant figure in the evolution of the novel in Europe. She held advanced views, for a woman of her time, on estate management, politics and education, and corresponded with some of the leading literary and economic writers, including Sir Walter Scott and David Ricardo.  - The Absentee is a novel by Maria Edgeworth, published in 1812 in \\"Tales of Fashionable Life\\", that expresses the systemic evils of the absentee landlord class of Anglo-Irish and the desperate condition of the Irish peasantry.  - The Gordon Riots of 1780 began as an anti-Catholic protest in London against the Papists Act of 1778, which was intended to reduce official discrimination against British Catholics. The protest evolved into riots and looting.  - A riot is a form of civil disorder commonly characterized by a group lashing out in a violent public disturbance against authority, property or people. Riots typically involve vandalism and the destruction of property, public or private. The property targeted varies depending on the riot and the inclinations of those involved. Targets can include shops, cars, restaurants, state-owned institutions, and religious buildings.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - An autobiography (from the Greek, -\\"autos\\" self + -\\"bios\\" life + -\\"graphein\\" to write) is a written account of the life of a person written by that person. In other words, it is a self-written life story.  - Castle Rackrent, a short novel by Maria Edgeworth published in 1800, is often regarded as the first historical novel, the first regional novel in English, the first Anglo-Irish novel, the first Big House novel and the first saga novel.  - David Ricardo (18 April 1772  11 September 1823) was a British political economist. He was one of the most influential of the classical economists, along with Thomas Malthus, Adam Smith, and James Mill.  - Harrington is an 1817 novel by British novelist Maria Edgeworth . The novel was written in response to a letter from a Jewish - American reader who complained about Edgeworth 's stereotypically anti-semitic portrayals of Jews in Castle Rackrent ( 1800 ) , Belinda ( 1801 ) , The Absentee ( 1812 ) , and her Moral Tales ( 1801 ) for children .

What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"The given sentence provides us with a significant piece of information concerning the celestial object 1097 Vicia and its escape velocity. To extract a detailed understanding from this sentence, let's break it down into its key components: 1. 1097 Vicia: This refers to a celestial object, more specifically, an asteroid. Asteroids are small, rocky celestial bodies that are mostly found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in a region known as the Asteroid Belt. 1097 Vicia is classified as an asteroid and was discovered on February 7, 1929, by Belgian astronomer Eugène Joseph Delporte.  2. Escape velocity: Escape velocity is the minimum speed required for an object to indefinitely break free from the gravitational influence of a celestial body, given that it does not encounter any other forces apart from gravity. The concept of escape velocity is essential in the field of space travel, particularly when designing spacecraft that need to leave or land on celestial bodies. 3. 0.0112 km per sec: This numerical value represents the escape velocity of 1097 Vicia, expressed in kilometers per second (km/s). Knowing the escape velocity of a celestial object can help scientists and mission planners to determine the amount of energy required for a spacecraft to successfully leave the asteroid's gravitational influence and return to Earth or venture further into space. Based on the given sentence, we can understand that the asteroid 1097 Vicia has an escape velocity of 0.0112 km/s.

The cereal has lots of different yummy things for the plants to eat, which we call \\"nutrients.\\" Just like when we eat cereal and it goes away, when plants eat those nutrients, they also go away.  Now, imagine that the village is growing lots of plants on the soil all the time, like a big farm. Those plants eat up a lot of the yummy nutrients. Over time, the bowl of cereal starts to become empty, because plants keep eating from it and nobody is putting more yummy things back in.  So, when the soil in the village doesn't have enough nutrients for plants to grow big and strong, it's because the plants have been eating lots of yummy things and they need more.

Question: \\"What happened to Ongjin?\\"  Context: \\"By mid-1950, North Korean forces numbered between 150,000 and 200,000 troops, organized into 10 infantry divisions, one tank division, and one air force division, with 210 fighter planes and 280 tanks, who captured scheduled objectives and territory, among them Kaesong, Chuncheon, Uijeongbu, and Ongjin. Their forces included 274 T-34-85 tanks, 200 artillery pieces, 110 attack bombers, some 150 Yak fighter planes, 78 Yak trainers, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft. In addition to the invasion force, the North KPA had 114 fighters, 78 bombers, 105 T-34-85 tanks, and some 30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea. Although each navy consisted of only several small warships, the North and South Korean navies fought in the war as sea-borne artillery for their in-country armies.\\"  Answer:","output":"In the context of the Korean War that began in mid-1950, Ongjin refers to a region in North Korea known as the Ongjin Peninsula. Situated in the Hwanghae province, Ongjin played a significant role in the conflict between the North and South Korean forces and would undergo significant changes during the course of the war. As mentioned, the North Korean forces, also known as the Korean People's Army (KPA), started with a strong military presence, numbering between 150,000 and 200,000 troops. These forces were organized into multiple infantry divisions, tank divisions, and an air force division, giving them substantial firepower and resources in their campaign against South Korea. The KPA was successful in capturing several objectives and territories early in the war, including Kaesong, Chuncheon, Uijeongbu, and Ongjin. The North Korean forces were well-equipped, boasting 274 T-34-85 tanks, 200 artillery pieces, 110 attack bombers, 150 Yak fighter planes, 78 Yak trainers, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft. In addition to these forces, the KPA had more than 30,000 soldiers and numerous military assets stationed in reserve within North Korea. This powerful military force allowed North Korea to make significant advancements in the early stages of the war, including the capture of Ongjin. Ongjin was a strategic location given its position on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula. Its capture allowed the KPA to easily move and supply troops along the coastlines, providing them with a tactical advantage over the South Korean forces. Furthermore, the Ongjin Peninsula is located close to the South Korean capital, Seoul, which may have contributed to its significant importance in the early stages of the war.  The navies of North and South Korea fought intense battles during this period, including engagements near the Ongjin Peninsula. Both sides consisted of small warships, and their primary function was to provide artillery support for their respective ground forces. The naval skirmishes around Ongjin would have had considerable strategic importance given its location and the need to maintain control of logistical supply lines and key coastal regions. In conclusion, Ongjin played a critical role in the Korean War due to its geographic location and strategic importance for both sides of the conflict. The North Korean forces managed to capture Ongjin early in the war, which allowed them a tactical advantage in the initial stages of the conflict. The control of Ongjin allowed the KPA to maintain and supply their troops effectively and facilitated their advancements towards the center of South Korea. It was inevitably subject to intense conflict as the war progressed, and its fate would be shaped by the decisions and outcomes of the North and South Korean forces throughout the entirety of the war."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When they are fired from their latest gig (their music is deemed too old-fashioned and not with the times), Daniel goes to pawn his guitar in order to buy groceries. Jan wanders off on her own and encounters a shifty reptilian character in a white suit who introduces himself as \\"B.L. Zebubb\\", a record producer. He and his weasel assistant, Weez Weezel, offer her fame and fortune in exchange for signing a contract in blood. Jan does not read the fine print and trusts B.L., signing herself over to his record production company. Little does she suspect that B.L. is none other than the Devil himself, and at the height of her fame he will return to collect her soul. To assist her, Weez conjures three band members from thin air, a rabbit (Rabbit Delight), a beaver (Boom Boom Beaver), and a praying mantis (Pray Mantis). As \\"Funky Jan\\", Jan is soon the most popular rock star on the planet while the oblivious Daniel is left out in the cold. But when B.L. comes for her soul and she realizes what she has done, a distraught Jan goes to Daniel for help. A trial is held in the woods at night over Jan's soul, with Weez as the judge and Daniel acting as Jan's attorney. As an additional stipend, the Devil states that should Daniel lose the trial, his soul as well as Jan's will be taken as payment. At first, the trial seems hopeless, considering Daniel has no education as a lawyer and cannot present even the beginnings of a reasonable argument to release Jan. Having nothing else to offer, Daniel begins to sing a heartfelt song. Jan joins in, as do her three heretofore unhelpful band members. The other animals watching the trial begin to sing and clap along to the tune and so do the jury of lost souls. An enraged Devil attempts to summon forth demons to stop the heroes, but the spirits he conjures also fall prey to the sway of Daniel's music. A frustrated Devil finally leaves, returning to Hell and taking Weez and all his other minions with him. The two mice...

Review: Let me start off by saying that I didn't watch this movie at first with high expectations. It was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movies, and \\"MTV\\" was pasted on the front cover so I was not expecting much. What i was expecting was a tear-jerker, overly dramatic but at least effective. I was wrong. Firstly, let me start off that I had never read the book nor watched any other versions of the movie. The acting was my main gripe with the film. By god is it AWFUL. The main girl is pretty mediocre, but when compared to the rest of the cast she's Maryl Streep. The main \\"Hero\\", Heath, is just plain awful. He can sing decent sounding clichéd songs, but that's about it. His acting broke the 'sad' moments by being so bad at points that I just burst into laughter. The Isabel girl was pretty godawful too, and the brother was just a flat character that was played by an actor that couldn't display emotion whatsoever. And when he tried to, it failed miserably. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor, playing Edward, although it's obvious the direction was bad because even he did not live up to what I've seen him do. Oh, and the father wasn't half-bad to my memory, but he was in the movie for such a small amount of time I can hardly remember. The story itself was not very good. More breakups than you can imagine. Predictable story (Until the ending, which I barely understood). EXTREMELY one-sided characters with no real depth to them... Overall just not interesting or compelling, nothing we've never seen before done MUCH better, and nothing worth watching here. The ending is suppose to be a tearjerker. It did nothing of the sort. The ending isn't built up at all, it almost feels like an afterthought. In fact, I had to ask my friends WHY the ending actually happened, which when they explained it to me I must have had a look on my face of \\"Wait, when did they say that? What?\\". Never a good sign. The editing was probably the worst I've seen, though I do understand the fade-ins-fade-outs are done because this was originally made for TV, but that's really no excuse. Overall, the movie is just garbage. I'm a sensitive guy, I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons. I never cried during this crap, not even close. Really, this movie is not worth your time.

For week four, the Bears donned their 1940s throwbacks when they hosted the 1-2 Packers, the Bears having led the all-time series 93-89-2, but the Packers had won 9 of the previous 11 games. On offense, the Bears' worst-ranked rushing game (64 yards per game) had a chance to produce against the Packers, who were ranked 30th by allowing 156 yards per game, while opponents had run a league-most 37.3 times per game while scoring an also league-high five rushing touchdowns. Also, Matt Forte had recorded 336 yards and four touchdowns against the Packers in his last two games. The offense also was challenged by the pass defense, with defenders Sam Shields and Tramon Williams, who were stingy in man coverage. For the Bears' defense, the Packers had also struggled on the run, ranking 26th in the league with a 78-yard rushing average and the longest run being of 17 yards, while having averaged only 3.63 yards per carry. Additionally, Green Bay was ranked 28th in the league in yards. However, the team faced the Packers' passing attack, which featured the receiving duo of Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb. The former led the league in targets (37) and first downs (16), while ranking second in receiving yards (351), while the Bears had struggled with covering slant and dig routes, both of which Nelson excelled at. The latter had three touchdowns in 2014, but was used primarily for hitch and stick routes. The Packers were two-point favorites. Sherrick McManis, Shea McClellin, Roberto Garza, Matt Slauson, Jared Allen, Charles Leno, Jr., and Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. Kyle Long, Alshon Jeffery, and Ryan Mundy served as team captains for the game, while the honorary captains were Dick Butkus and Kurt Becker. The Packers won the coin toss, and decided to kick. On the first drive, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's six-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall, which the Packers responded with Eddie Lacy's two-yard touchdown run. During Chicago's next drive, on 4th and 1, Cutler fumbled the snap, and upon picking up the ball, recorded a 16-yard run on an accidental fumblerooski. The drive continued into the second quarter, ended with Robbie Gould kicking a 23-yard field goal. The two teams exchanged touchdowns on the final three plays: Aaron Rodgers' three-yard pass to Nelson, Cutler's eight-yard pass to Jeffery, and Rodgers' 22-yard pass to Cobb. The Bears reached the Packers' nine-yard line by the final play of the first half; on the play, Cutler's pass for Bennett was ruled short of a touchdown. During the television review, Micah Hyde covered the camera angle, preventing the touchdown and ending the half with the Packers leading 21-17. In the third quarter, the Packers drove to the Bears' 34-yard line, where Rodgers completed a touchdown pass to Davante Adams, which would be nullified by a holding penalty on center Corey Linsley; Crosby would eventually kick a 53-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler's pass for Josh Morgan would be tipped by Williams and intercepted by Clay Matthews, with Green Bay capitalizing on the takeaway with Rodgers' 11-yard touchdown pass to Nelson. On the next drive, Shields intercepted Cutler, and Crosby kicked a 23-yard field goal; however, a holding penalty on Jon Bostic led to Rodgers' three-yard touchdown pass to Cobb. On Chicago's next drive, Williams intercepted Cutler, but the play would be nullified; the Bears would subsequently punt. On the Packers' next drive, they would reach the Bears' 20-yard line before Crosby's field goal was blocked by Willie Young, the first block by the Bears in over a year. Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler on the final drive, and the Bears ran out the clock to end the game. The Bears recorded 496 yards, the first time since 1979 against the Minnesota Vikings that the Bears recorded such yardage and lost. The last time the team recorded more than 496 yards and lost occurred in 1947 against the Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Cardinals. Additionally, the rushing attack recorded 102 yards in the first quarter, the first time Chicago recorded at least 100 rushing yards in the first quarter since 2010 against the Carolina Panthers.

He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would car A emit less or more carbon monoxide than car B?  Hint: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere. Answer:","output":"Car A would emit less carbon monoxide than car B. This is because car A has a catalytic converter, which is a device designed to reduce the emissions of harmful gases produced by a combustion engine. One of the primary functions of a catalytic converter is to further oxidize carbon monoxide, a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel, into carbon dioxide. By passing the exhaust over the catalysts before they are released into the air, the emissions from car A's combustion engine are transformed into much less harmful substances. On the other hand, car B lacks a catalytic converter, which means that it does not have the same emissions-reducing technology as car A. As a result, the exhaust gases from car B's engine, including carbon monoxide, will not be as effectively treated and will be released in higher concentrations into the atmosphere. This makes car B a less environmentally friendly option compared to car A, even though its design may be more aesthetically appealing to John. In conclusion, car A, with its catalytic converter, will emit significantly less carbon monoxide than car B, which does not have this important emissions-reducing technology. Choosing a car with a catalytic converter, like car A, is a more environmentally responsible decision and contributes to a cleaner atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's that time of year when darkness descends like a heavy blanket beginning in mid-afternoon in much of the country. For some people, it also brings a desire to stay in bed and wait for spring.      Seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, affects an estimated 6% of Americans, causing depression, lethargy, irritability and a desire to avoid social situations. It can also create an urge to overeat, particularly carbohydrates. As many as 15% of people in the U.S. may have a milder version that includes only some of these symptoms. The incidence rises along with the distance from the equator: Roughly 8% of Canadians, 10% of Britons and as many as 20% of Scandinavians suffer from SAD this time of year.      Light therapy, using beams many times more intense than normal light, is the most common treatment. But a host of new therapies—from simulating dawn in your bedroom and changing your thoughts through cognitive-behavioral therapy to taking mega doses of vitamin D—are having success in some patients.      Despite decades of study, experts still aren't sure exactly what causes SAD, which is officially recognized as a form of major depression that remits in spring and summer. The seasonal and geographic patterns provide strong clues that it's related to the diminishing daylight in the fall and winter. One theory suggests that the reduced light disrupts peoples' circadian rhythms, the 24-hour biological clock that governs waking, sleeping and many other body functions. Another theory holds that the darkness wreaks havoc with neurotransmitters—brain chemicals that affect mood. Some experts believe the reduced sun exacerbates vitamin D deficiencies. It may also be that SAD has several different causes.      There are other mysteries, too. Why do SAD symptoms tend to peak in January and February, even though days are lengthening by then? Why does it hit most prominently between the ages of 18 and 30, and why are women three times as likely as men to be affected? The incidence of SAD is also surprisingly low in Iceland, where the homogenous population leads experts to surmise that genetic factors may also play a role.      Some people who have symptoms of SAD don't recognize them as part of a disorder. \\"Most people with winter depression blame themselves, or attribute it to something else—to not liking the cold or bad family experiences at Christmas time, or school or work stress,\\" says Michael Terman, director of the Center for Light Treatment and Biological Rhythms at Columbia University Medical Center in New York.      There is a wide range of treatments that can alleviate SAD symptoms. Most experts say that if you have mild winter blues, it's fine to try any of these remedies on your own. But if you have severe depression, whether it's related to seasonal patterns or not, consult a mental-health expert.      Light Therapy: The most extensively studied treatment is sitting before an intense light for 15 to 20 minutes daily. The theory is that when the sun rises later each day, people's circadian clocks tend to slip later, too, since they're regulated by light hitting the retina. But because most people have to wake up at the same time year-round, their bodies fall out of sync, which can bring sleep and mood disturbances.      Sun frame illustration by Jason Schneider; Getty Images (pills and milk); Agence France-Presse/Getty Images (lightbox); Alamy (hiker); Ron Watson/Pentex Photography (ionizer)      Light therapy can relieve symptoms in 80% of SAD cases, Dr. Terman says. It's most effective when timed to fit a person's individual circadian rhythm, ideally starting about eight hours after the pineal gland starts secreting melatonin, the hormone that stimulates sleep. That varies widely from person to person, depending on whether you're a night owl or a morning lark.      You can calculate your own melatonin onset point by taking the \\"morningness/eveningness\\" test at the Web site of the Center for Environmental Therapeutics Center, a nonprofit group of researchers studying light and circadian rhythms. (The test showed that I am a \\"definite evening\\" person, and it advised light therapy at 8 a.m. for me. My husband, a \\"moderate morning person,\\" would fare better with light therapy at 5:30 a.m.)      With the proper timing and dosing of light therapy, SAD sufferers should start to see their depression lift in as little as three days, says Dr. Terman, one of the founders of CET. He recommends using light therapy daily for at least three weeks. In some cases, symptoms can return without continuous usage. Users need to keep their eyes open, but not look at the light directly.      The Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate light-therapy products, and there are many confusing claims. According to CET, the best light boxes provide 10,000 lux of illumination—many times stronger than typical indoor light—and have a broad diffuser screen that filters out ultraviolet rays and projects downward toward the eyes. CET says the light should give off white light, rather than blue or \\"full spectrum\\" light, which it says provide \\"no known therapeutic advantage.\\" The group's Web site sells a recommended model with a stand for 180.      A controversy is brewing over blue light, which some other experts believe can reset circadian clocks more efficiently than white light. Last year, Philips Electronics NV introduced portable models, the goLITE BLU, which uses shortwave blue light (199), and the briteLITE, which uses white light with added blue spectrum (230). A study of 18 moderately depressed patients at Brigham and Women's Hospital, supported in part by the manufacturer, found that both types of lights used for 45 minutes a day for three weeks lifted depression in 82% of subjects. The study was published in September in a Scandinavian journal.      But some ophthalmologists worry that exposure to blue light could damage retinas and exacerbate age-related macular degeneration. Philips says the goLITE BLU is safe when used according to instructions, but anyone with eye disease should consult an ophthalmologist before using it.      Side effects to light therapy are usually minimal. Some users get headaches or mild nausea initially, and a few feel restless or have trouble sleeping. But the main downside is the time and daily diligence required.      Dawn Simulation: A newer form of light therapy gradually turns the light on in your bedroom, creating a slow transition from darkness to dawn in the room while it's still dark outside. Even though the user is still asleep, and the maximum light is much dimmer than traditional light therapy, a few studies have found that dawn simulation can ease depression and help people wake up with more energy. Best of all, \\"it's basically over by the time you wake up,\\" says Dr. Terman.      Inexpensive \\"dawn alarm clocks\\" that sit on a nightstand probably don't have the same effect because it's easy to turn away from the light source in your sleep, Dr. Terman says. Other models, including one sold by CET for 215, attach to an overhead fixture to flood the room with light from above.      Negative Air Ions: The air near a pounding surf or after a lightning storm has oxygen molecules that are naturally charged with extra electrons, called negative air ions. These have long been believed to have mood-lifting properties. In the 1990s, researchers at Columbia University tested an air-flow device that created such negative ions and found that in high doses, they were as effective as light therapy in helping to ease depression. One theory is that inhaling so-called superoxygenated air raises the oxygen level of the bloodstream as it pumps to needy tissues in the body.      Several models of ion generators are on the market. Some, designed to be used for 30 to 60 minutes daily, include a wrist strap that is meant to channel the ions directly to the body to be absorbed through the skin. Other models work overnight, filling the entire room with negative ions. There are no known side effects, but research is still limited.      Antidepressants: If light therapy isn't sufficient to alleviate SAD symptoms, some patients find relief from antidepressants, particularly selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. A multicenter study in Canada that followed 96 patients over three winters found that those subjects randomly assigned to take fluoxetine (Prozac) and a placebo light therapy fared just as well as those taking 10,000-lux light therapy and a placebo capsule. The light therapy worked faster, and had fewer side effects, according to the study, published in 2006 in the American Journal of Psychiatry.      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Even though SAD clearly seems related to biological functions, researchers are finding that changing one's behavior can help alleviate symptoms. \\"There's a lot of evidence to show that thinking in SAD patients becomes maladaptive in the winter time—they have more negative thoughts, they ruminate more, they retreat from things that are fun and enjoyable. We call it going into hibernation mode,\\" says Kelly Rohan, associate professor of psychology at the University of Vermont. Dr. Rohan and her colleagues developed a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program, in which patients identified, and then challenged, negative thoughts and behaviors (like declining social invitations and spending time in bed) that were contributing to their depression. She also had them identify enjoyable wintertime activities and do them, starting with just 10 minutes a day and gradually working up to more.      In a study of 69 patients published in the journal Behavior Therapy this year, Dr. Rohan and colleagues treated some SAD patients with CBT, some with light therapy and some with a combination, and followed them through two winters. About 37% of the patients treated with light therapy had a recurrence of depression. That compared with 7% of patients treated only with CBT, and 6% of patients who received a combination of treatments.      Vitamin D: This is created by the sun's rays on the skin, and therefore declines during the winter. Deficiencies have been linked to a wide variety of illnesses, including depression. So it stands to reason that vitamin D might play a role in SAD. Yet the few studies involving vitamin D and SAD patients have had conflicting results.      A 1993 study of 125 Boston women with seasonal mood swings found that those who received 400 international units of vitamin D-2—double the current recommended daily allowance for adults aged 19 to 50—fared no better than those who got a placebo.      But vitamin D proponents say the doses used in that and other similar studies were too small to be effective, and they note that vitamin D-2 is weaker than vitamin D-3, the widely preferred form of the vitamin. A 1999 study at John Hopkins University Medical Center administered a big one-time dose of 100,000 IUs of vitamin D-3 to eight SAD patients. Another seven patients received light therapy with full-spectrum light, thought at the time to be the most effective light source. The light-therapy group showed no significant improvement on three separate depression scales. But \\"to my surprise, every single person who got vitamin D improved,\\" says lead investigator Michael Gloth, a geriatrician at John Hopkins, who continues the high-dosage treatment for his elderly SAD patients today.      Researchers agree that more study is needed on the effects of vitamin D, and at what doses. Vitamin D can't be gotten from a light-therapy box, which should screen out ultraviolet-B rays. Midday sunbathers can get plenty of vitamin D in about 20 minutes in the summertime in New York City. But UVB rays are much weaker in the winter. North of a line running roughly from Boston to northern California, between October and March, the sun's rays aren't strong enough to provide vitamin D.      While some foods contain vitamin D—particularly fish, eggs, cod liver oil and fortified milk—the most efficient way to get it is with supplements. Some experts recommend getting at least 4,000 IUs of D-3 daily. \\"There's compelling evidence that if you are deficient, taking more vitamin D can be very very helpful,\\" says Dr. Gloth.      Suntanning: Both sunlight and tanning beds do provide UVB rays, which produce vitamin D in the body. There's also some speculation that UVB rays may stimulate endorphins, a natural hormone that acts like a pain-reducing, pleasure-enhancing opiate in the brain.      But some experts criticize some tanning salons' practice of advertising their services as mood lifting. And Monday, the FDA issued a reminder to consumers that the ultraviolet radiation in sunlamps and tanning beds pose serious risks for sunburn, skin cancer, eye damage and premature aging.      Exercise outdoors: Even if the winter light is weak, some experts believe that taking a morning or noontime walk can go a long way toward alleviating SAD symptoms. \\"It's easy for people to imagine that there's a magical device, but investing in a good overcoat might be more cost-effective in the long run,\\" says Janis Anderson, director of Seasonal Affective Disorders services at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. \\"I've had people who have SAD problems and have chosen to walk to work in the morning rather than take the car, and that's been a great treatment.\\"      Diet: Fighting the urge to splurge on carbohydrates can also be helpful (even though there is some evidence that chocolate boosts the neurotransmitter serotonin). Opting for more vegetables and keeping meals light can improve insulin regulation, which can also improve mood. But Dr. Terman says that generally, the craving for carbohydrates will lessen when the depression itself lessens, and not vice versa.

Top of the Pops, also known as TOTP, is a British music chart television programme, made by the BBC and originally broadcast weekly between 1 January 1964 and 30 July 2006. It was traditionally shown every Thursday evening on BBC One, except for a short period on Fridays in mid-1973 before being again moved to Fridays in 1996 and then to Sundays on BBC Two in 2005. Each weekly programme consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling popular music artists, with a rundown of that week's singles chart. Additionally, there was a special edition of the programme on Christmas Day (and usually, until 1984, a second such edition a few days after Christmas), featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year. From 1967, the show had become closely associated with the BBC radio station Radio 1, usually being presented by DJs from the station, and between 1988 and 1991 the programme was simulcast on the radio station in FM stereo. However, during the last few years of the 1980s the association became less close, and was severed completely (although not permanently) in a radical shake-up known as the 'Year Zero' revamp.  Following a fall in viewing figures and a general perception that the show had become 'uncool' (acts like The Clash had refused to appear in the show in previous years), a radical new format was introduced by incoming executive producer Stanley Appel (who had worked on the programme since 1966 as cameraman, production assistant, director and stand-in producer) in October 1991, in which the Radio 1 DJs were replaced by a team of relative unknowns, such as Claudia Simon and Tony Dortie who had previously worked for Children's BBC, 17-year-old local radio DJ Mark Franklin, Steve Anderson, Adrian Rose and Elayne Smith, who was replaced by Femi Oke in 1992. A brand new theme tune ('Now Get Out Of That'), title sequence and logo were introduced, and the entire programme moved from BBC Television Centre in London to BBC Elstree Centre in Borehamwood.  The new presenting team would take turns hosting (initially usually in pairs but sometimes solo), and would often introduce acts in an out-of-vision voiceover over the song's instrumental introduction. They would sometimes even conduct short informal interviews with the performers, and initially the Top 10 countdown was run without any voiceover. Rules relating to performance were also altered meaning acts had to sing live as opposed to the backing tracks for instruments and mimed vocals for which the show was known. To incorporate the shift of dominance towards American artists, more use was made of out-of-studio performances, with acts in America able to transmit their song to the Top of the Pops audience \\"via satellite\\". These changes were widely unpopular and much of the presenting team were axed within a year, leaving the show hosted solely by Dortie and Franklin (apart from the Christmas Day editions, when both presenters appeared) from October 1992, on a week-by-week rotation. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What caused them to be less close?","output":"The cause of the show Top of the Pops and BBC radio station Radio 1 to become less close in their association was a fall in viewing figures and a general perception that the show had become 'uncool.'

I didn't mean to hurt my aunt's feelings, but it did.I spent the evening in an ugly blue telephone booth  . crying as I spoke to a family friend who lived in England. When I left the phone booth, I went back to a silent house with three closed bedroom doors. In the morning, I heard everyone get up and leave for work and school. I wrote a note to say sorry and pulled my bags to the train station. When I got into London, I had to take the underground to Angel Station to get to my family friend's house. I was familiar with the underground, but at the time, it was just endless white tiles .Coming to England seemed like a bad decision. Crying yet again, I tried to lift my suitcase up the stairs. When I was trying hard to walk forward, there were hands. Each time I faced another group of steps,a hand would lift the suitcase. At the top of the steps, the hand would let go, and I'd pull the suitcase to the next group. And just as I wanted to try again,another hand would appear. It happened several times. I never looked up, because I couldn't stop crying.Each hand looked different, and many different people helped me, without asking or saying anything. I couldn't look up. I wasn't able to say thank you. I went on to have an amazing year studying in England, but that was the last time I saw or spoke to any of my uncle's family. Yet when I think about _ in 2008, I remember those strangers' hands. They were there when I needed them, and even now, they help me out of the sadness of that memory.

Write highlights for this article: Rent in London is so high that one young professional has worked out it would be cheaper live in Barcelona and fly to work. Social Media manager Sam Cookney, 30, wanted a less expensive way of travelling to his office near Liverpool Street station. What he found was an unlikely solution: it would be more cost effective to relocate to the sun-kissed coast of north east Spain, more than 700 miles away. Cheap alternative: Mr Cookney found the lack of council tax charges and low rent in Barcelona, above, meant it is cheaper to live there and fly to London. Expensive: London's council tax charges make the city more expensive than alternatives in Europe, Mr Cookney found. Mr Cookney said that a combination of cheap rent, travel and the lack of council tax charges in the Spanish city would more than undercut the high prices of travel cards living costs in the English capital. He arrived at the extraordinary solution by doing sums based on property and travel websites. LONDON:. One bed flat, West Hampstead - £1,505. Council tax - £75. Zone 1-2 travel card - £116.60. TOTAL: £1,697  per month. BARCELONA:. Three bed flat, Les Corts, £580. Council tax - £0. Ryanair flight, metro - £778. TOTAL: £1,358 per month. A one-bedroom flat in West Hampstead would cost around £1,505, according to Zoopla. He then added in. council tax at approximately £75 and a zone 1-2 travelcard to get to his. job in the City, which costs £116.80, making a total of £1,697. Mr Cookney said: 'I chose West Hampstead because I know. and like the area, and it doesn’t seem a stretch to suggest that a young. professional may afford to live there' He then compared the prices to Barcelona where a three-bedroom flat, with three balconies, a stone’s throw away. from the metro, in the 'nice and safe' area of Les Corts which costs £580 per month. Mr Cookney added, 'I used to live there, and being a fairly upmarket residential district, it’s a very decent and fair comparison to West Hampstead. 'There are, of course, cheaper flats, but I was trying to compare apples with apples – even in spite of the three bedrooms.' With rent obviously cheaper, Mr Cookney then considered travel. He found that he could fly back and forth from Barcelona to Stansted via Ryanair nearly every day in November for £29 a trip. Jet set: He discovered that a four day commute using Ryanair flights to get into London from Spain would work cut the cost of living by £339 per-month. He added £5 to get to from Barcelona’s el Prat airport and a £14. return to Liverpool Street, making £19 in total on land travel each day. That’s. fixed commuting costs of £48 a day, 4 days a week, for 4 weeks a month,. which worked out at £778. Add on rent of £580 a month and the cost of living. in Barcelona and commuting to London comes to £1,358 a month. That’s £339 less than the cost of living in London and commuting from Zone 2. Add that to the fact that he could live in a sunny city by the sea, and Mr Cookney said his findings were 'beyond crazy'. He said: 'I could walk to my desk by 9:30am, with time for a Pret coffee and bacon and cheese croissant en route' 'It's just beyond crazy, and completely unsustainable'. Too much: Mr Cookney was forced into looking for alternatives after he became sick of the sky high rent prices for relatively small accommodation in north and west London. Pricey journey: He based his sums around a commute from West Hampstead to Liverpool Street station, above, and a similar trip from Barcelona. 'I. feel like it's reaching a tipping point. I've been discussing with. friends this week, and several of us have said that we're going to have. to consider leaving London. The sums just don't add up' The only concession he had to make was that he could work from home for one day a week with flights of a weekend being far more pricey. He said: 'I thought at least it would require some poetic licence or dodgy sums. 'But the only assumption I’m making is that I work a four-day week in London, with a day at home (i.e. Barcelona).'

(CNN)  -- Two Florida school administrators were due to appear in federal court Thursday to face contempt charges for saying a prayer at a school luncheon. Rep. Mike McIntyre is one of three members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus backing the school officials. Frank Lay, principal of Pace High School in Pace, Florida, and school athletic director Robert Freeman are accused of violating a consent decree banning employees of Santa Rosa County schools from endorsing religion. They face a nonjury trial before U.S. District Judge M.C. Rodgers. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to six months in prison and fined, subject to sentencing guidelines. Defense attorneys have said it is it outrageous Lay and Freeman are facing prosecution for \\"a simple prayer.\\" But the American Civil Liberties Union, whose lawsuit led to the consent decree, maintains students have a right to be free from administrators who foist their personal religious beliefs on them. However, an ACLU representative said the organization \\"never suggested\\" people should go to jail for violating the decree, and the organization is not involved in the criminal proceedings. The ACLU filed suit last year against the school district in northwest Florida on behalf of two Pace students who alleged that \\"officials regularly promoted religion and led prayers at school events,\\" according to an ACLU statement. Both parties approved the consent decree put in place January 9 under which district and school officials are \\"permanently prohibited from promoting, advancing, endorsing, participating in or causing prayers during or in conjunction with school events,\\" the ACLU said. Lay was a party in the initial lawsuit, and his attorney was among those approving the consent decree, according to the organization. In addition, the court required that all district employees receive a copy. But on January 28, \\"Lay asked Freeman to offer a prayer of blessing during a school-day luncheon for the dedication of a new field house at Pace High School,\\" according to court documents. \\"Freeman complied with the request and offered the prayer at the event. It appears this was a school-sponsored event attended by students, faculty and community members.\\" Attorneys from Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal group helping defend Lay and Freeman, have said that attendees included booster club members and other adults who helped the field house project -- all \\"consenting adults.\\" Three U.S. lawmakers who are members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus have written a letter in support of the two school administrators, saying that \\"many of America's Founding Fathers were resolute in their faiths, and the impact of such is evident in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and many of their writings.\\" The letter from Reps. J. Randy Forbes, R-Virginia; Mike McIntyre, D-North Carolina; and Jeff Miller, R-Florida, said the congressmen were writing as members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus. \\"The tradition of offering prayer in America has become so interwoven into our nation's spiritual heritage that to charge someone criminally for engaging in such a practice would astonish the men who founded this country on religious liberty,\\" the lawmakers wrote.

We have the equation: -63 + 91 = 7*r First, we need to add -63 and 91, which is like having 91 apples and taking away 63 of them. When we do that, we get: 28 = 7*r Now we have 28 equals 7 times r. To find what r is, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 7. It's like saying 7 groups of something (r) gives us 28.  So, 28 divided by 7 is: 28 ÷ 7 = 4 This means that r = 4.

Information:  - Merle Robert Travis (November 29, 1917  October 20, 1983) was an American country and western singer, songwriter, and guitarist born in Rosewood, Kentucky. His song's lyrics often discussed both the lives and the economic exploitation of American coal miners. Among his many well-known songs are \\"Sixteen Tons,\\" \\"Re-Enlistment Blues,\\" \\"I am a Pilgrim,\\" and \\"Dark as a Dungeon.\\" However, it is his unique guitar style, still called Travis Picking by guitarists, as well as his interpretations of the rich musical traditions of his native Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, for which he is best known today. \\"Travis Picking\\" is a syncopated style of guitar fingerpicking rooted in ragtime music in which alternating chords and bass notes are plucked by the thumb while melodies are simultaneously plucked by the index finger. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970 and elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1977.  - \\"Dark as a Dungeon\\" is a song written by singer-songwriter Merle Travis. It is a lament about the danger and drudgery of being a coal miner in an Appalachian shaft mine. It has become a rallying song among miners seeking improved working conditions.  - Kennedy Jones or Jonesey ( 1 August 1900 -- 6 September 1990 ) was an American guitarist and music writer . He was a pioneer of the \`\` thumb picking '' style often associated with Merle Travis ... He was born on a farm in Muhlenberg County , Kentucky . He received his inspiration from his mother Alice who played several instruments . He married Irene Hicks , a pianist , and they performed together early in his career . He claimed to be the first guitarist to play using a thumbpick - at a square dance in 1918 . Previously thumbpicks had been used only for the banjo or hawaiian guitar . He also played the fiddle and declined to join Merle Travis 's band The Drifting Pioneers . Jones composed the thumbpickers anthem \`\` Cannonball Rag '' , but when Travis recorded the tune in the 1940s , the latter received the credit . In 1939 Jones moved to Chicago . He played in several bands , one which included his sons , Donald and Kennedy Jr. His daughter Farre Lee too was an accomplished guitarist / singer , who regularly performed on radio station WLW . In the 1950s Jones moved to Cincinnati close to his daughter . Travis , Mose Rager and Ike Everly all claim to have been influenced by Jonesey . All four men were honored by the construction of The Four Legends Fountain in Drakesboro , Kentucky . He is buried at Bridgetown cemetery , Cincinnati , Ohio . His youngest son Donald E. Jones , along with his eldest son Kennedy , played alongside each other on the TV program The Midwestern Hayride .  - Ragtime  also spelled rag-time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.  - Muhlenberg County is a county located in the U.S. Commonwealth of Kentucky. As of the 2010 census, the population was 31,499. Its county seat is Greenville. The county was founded in 1798 and named for General Peter Muhlenberg, a colonial general during the American Revolutionary War.  - \\"Sixteen Tons\\" is a song about a coal miner, based on life in coal mines in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. It was written and first recorded by Merle Travis at the Radio Recorders Studio B in Hollywood, California on August 8, 1946. Cliffie Stone played bass on the recording. It was first released by Capitol on the album \\"Folk Songs of the Hills\\" (July 1947). The song became a gold record.    What is the relationship between 'kennedy jones ' and 'songwriter'? A:","output":"Kennedy Jones, also known as Jonesey, was an American guitarist and music writer. He was a pioneer of the \\"thumb picking\\" style often associated with Merle Travis, who was a country and western singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Both Kennedy Jones and Merle Travis were from Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. Jonesey's guitar playing style influenced Merle Travis and other musicians, such as Mose Rager and Ike Everly. Although the question focuses on the relationship between Kennedy Jones and the term \\"songwriter,\\" it is important to note that his primary influence lay in his unique guitar playing style and not necessarily his songwriting abilities. However, both Jones and Travis contributed significantly to the music culture of their time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Why do different materials have different specific heat capacities? What is the relationship between the boiling point of a substance, and its specific heat capacity? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"These questions are related, but they don't have the same meaning. Let's address them one by one to provide a better understanding: 1. Why do different materials have different specific heat capacities? To answer this question, let's first define specific heat capacity. Specific heat capacity is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of a substance by 1 degree Celsius. Step 1: Understand the basics of specific heat capacity. Specific heat capacity depends on the material's atomic and molecular structure, as well as the type of bonding (ionic, covalent, metallic) between atoms and molecules. Step 2: Consider the atomic and molecular structure of materials. Different materials have different atomic and molecular structures, which affect their ability to absorb and store energy. Materials with a more complex structure or stronger bonds generally have higher specific heat capacities because they can absorb more energy without undergoing major changes in temperature. Step 3: Consider the type of bonding in materials. Some materials have stronger bonds between their atoms and/or molecules, which means more energy is required to make the particles move faster and increase the temperature. This results in a higher specific heat capacity for that material. 2. What is the relationship between the boiling point of a substance and its specific heat capacity? The relationship between the boiling point of a substance and its specific heat capacity is not a direct one but is related through the heat of vaporization. Step 1: Understand boiling point. Boiling point is the temperature at which a substance changes from its liquid phase to its gaseous phase. The boiling point is affected by factors such as atmospheric pressure and the strength of intermolecular forces. Step 2: Understand specific heat capacity in the context of phase changes. During a phase change, such as boiling, energy is used to overcome intermolecular forces instead of increasing temperature. The specific heat capacity refers to the energy required to raise the temperature of a substance, not its phase change. Step 3: Establish the relationship using heat of vaporization. The heat of vaporization is the energy required to change 1 kg of a substance from liquid to gas at its boiling point. While specific heat capacity is related to the amount of energy needed to change the temperature of a substance, the heat of vaporization is associated with the energy needed to change the phase. So, there is a connection between boiling point and specific heat capacity, but it is indirect and mediated by the heat of vaporization. In conclusion, the two questions presented are related but different in meaning. The first question deals with the reason why different materials have different specific heat capacities, while the second question focuses on the relationship between the boiling point of a substance and its specific heat capacity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers.  Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws.  Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Crossroads, Super PACs and the Incumbent Advertising Gap In a recent piece about the Obama-Romney ad wars, Michael Scherer made the smart point that this election is different from past ones in that the incumbent no longer gets a free hit on his rival during the period immediately following the primary. The reason: super PACs have the cash to cover that gap while the challenger collects enough general election funds to keep pace. While Bush was able to blanket airwaves uncontested, Obama has been fending off television ad buys by four different groups that oppose the president, Crossroads GPS, Americans For Prosperity, the American Future Fund and Restore Our Future. Each of them have the ability to raise unlimited amounts of money from wealthy donors, and to spend that money tarnishing Obama’s record. As a result, Obama has been forced to play defense even as he tries to capitalize on Romney’s relative lack of general election funds. Recent court decisions, which undid campaign finance regulations that were in place in 2004, have effectively eliminated a key advantage of incumbency. That new dynamic is on display today as Crossroads GPS, the flagship Republican super PAC, announces a 25 million TV offensive, spearheaded by an 8 million buy running in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, May 17 through May 31. The overall size of the buy and its specific swing states targets are exactly the same as those announced by the Obama campaign in their first big TV push of the year. Economy bad, Obama promises broken. That’s pretty much the referendum argument Romney needs to make. Thanks to Crossroads, he doesn’t need to worry about making it on TV right this minute. Summary:","output":"Super PACs are affecting the 2012 election by covering the gap in advertising funds during the period right after the primary when the challenger is collecting enough general election funds. Unlike past elections, incumbent President Obama has to face opposition from four groups, including Crossroads GPS, that can raise unlimited amounts of money to be spent on ads against him. This forces Obama to play defense instead of capitalizing on Romney's lack of general election funds, eliminating a key advantage of incumbency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The lyrics, which describe a self-absorbed, narcissistic individual, have sparked considerable debate and speculation about who the character in question might be. Carly Simon has remained cryptic about the inspiration behind the song, only offering occasional hints and teasing that the song may be about multiple people rather than one individual.

If you ask Americans whether or not they think their former president George W. Bush is smart, most of them will probably tell you they don't think so. However, Bush's IQ score is estimated to be above 120, which puts him in the top ten percent of the population.  It doesn't seem to make sense. How come someone with such an IQ score is not considered smart? Researchers say: IQ does not tell the whole story. Some people have high IQ scores, but still they can be poor thinkers and decision-makers.  Keith Stanovich, a Canadian professor of human development and applied psychology, has been looking into the \\"clever fools\\" phenomenon for 15 years. He says IQ tests are very good at measuring certain mental faculties , including logic, learning ability, working-memory capacity (how much information you can hold in mind), etc. Those faculties play a part in one's academic success, but rational thinking is more important for us to make good judgments in real-life situations.  IQ tests fail to work when it comes to rational thinking. That's because they are unable to assess things such as a person's ability to weigh up information, or whether an individual can set aside the cognitive biases that may be misleading.  \\"A high IQ is like height in a basketball player,\\" says David Perkins, who studies thinking and reasoning skills at Harvard University. \\"It is very important, all other things being equal. But all other things aren't equal. It takes a lot more to be a good basketball player than being tall, and it takes a lot more to be a good thinker than having a high IQ.\\" 1.

He is the recipient of several awards, including two Filmfare Awards, and is among the highest-paid actors in the country. After completing a bachelor's degree from Indiana University Bloomington, Singh returned to India to pursue his career in films. He made his acting debut in 2010 with a leading role in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Band Baaja Baaraat. In January 2010, Singh was called for an audition by Shanoo Sharma, the head of the casting division for Yash Raj Films. They informed him that it was for a lead role in their film titled Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy set in the world of wedding planning. Aditya Chopra, the vice president of the company, later saw the audition tapes on video and was impressed by Singh's acting, and decided that he fit the part of Bittoo Sharma, the hero of the film. However, the director Maneesh Sharma needed some more convincing and he was called for a few more auditions over the next two weeks until they were completely convinced of his caliber. After the two weeks of testing, Singh was confirmed for the role of Bittoo, with Anushka Sharma playing the female lead.  Singh described the role of Bittoo Sharma as a typical Delhi boy. To prepare for the role, he spent time with students at the Delhi University campus. Prior to the release of the film, trade analysts were skeptical of the film's commercial potential, citing the middling response to Yash Raj Films' last few productions, the lack of a male star and the fact that the female lead, Anushka Sharma, was by then an \\"almost-forgotten\\" actress. However, Band Baaja Baaraat went on to become a sleeper hit. Singh's portrayal of Bittoo was praised, with Anupama Chopra of NDTV writing that Singh was \\"pitch perfect in the role of the uncouth but good-hearted small town slacker who is a bit of a duffer when it comes to matters of the heart.\\" The film earned approximately Rs214 million (US3.3 million) at the domestic box office. At the 56th Filmfare Awards, Singh won the award for Best Male Debut.  Following Band Baaja Baarat, Singh signed on for Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, a romantic comedy produced by Chopra and directed by Maneesh Sharma. He played a conman Ricky Bahl who cons girls for a living but finally meets his match. The film co-starred Anushka Sharma, Parineeti Chopra, Dipannita Sharma and Aditi Sharma. According to Singh, the title character had various avatars in the film, including a chirpy, entertaining side and a sinister side. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India wrote, \\"Ranveer is, well Ranveer: your average Joe kind of hero who looks convincing enough as Sunny, Deven, Iqbal, Ricky, his sundry avatars.\\" Commercially, Ladies vs Ricky Bahl earned Rs370 million (US5.7 million) domestically.

Just like when we plan for birthday parties, but this is for a big, beautiful wedding! He played the role of Bittoo Sharma who is described as a typical Delhi boy. It was a real challenge for him and he had to go learn from students at Delhi University to prepare for the role. Later he even won an award for \\"Best Male Debut\\" at the 56th Filmfare Awards for his role in this film! Imagine that, getting an award for pretending to be someone else in a movie!

But this delicate mission wasn't as simple as it appeared. There were several factors I had to take into account. First and foremost, I needed to find a way to sneak out without being noticed. This would involve devising a plan that ensured minimal contact with people, especially Dimitri, who would undoubtedly have his eyes and ears open for any signs of betrayal. I had to be cautious, calculating, and swift—all at the same time. One possible course of action would be to wait until nightfall. At that time, the resort's inhabitants would be preoccupied, either relaxing in their rooms or enjoying the nighttime entertainment at the various bars and restaurants on the premises. Under cover of darkness, I would have an easier time making my escape. If needed, I could feign illness or a desire for an early night, excusing myself from any social obligations. During my escape, I'd have to be vigilant of any security cameras or guards that may be scattered throughout the resort. It would also be wise to avoid main hallways and entrances, opting for poorly lit, less frequented paths that wouldn't attract unwanted attention. The next challenge would be finding someone I could trust with the sensitive information I'd been given. This person would have to be reliable, discreet, and capable of taking action against Dimitri without endangering my wellbeing or exposing my involvement in the betrayal. I couldn't risk trusting the wrong person, as word of my actions could easily get back to Dimitri or even the Strigoi themselves. Once I had found someone suitable to confide in, we would need to form a plan together. This plan should include multiple contingencies for the likely scenarios that could arise upon the unveiling of Dimitri's secret. It might involve enlisting allies to help confront Dimitri, or it could require seeking assistance from the proper authorities outside the resort. However, even with all these measures in place, there would still be a significant level of risk involved. My safety would be in continuous danger, both from Dimitri and the Strigoi he had been receiving information from. Confronting these powerful, dangerous beings would require strength, stake, and an unwavering determination to protect myself and those around me. I would need to be prepared for the worst. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to act on this information would come down to weighing the potential dangers against the potential rewards. If the information I had could indeed save lives and prevent harm, my choice would be clear. But it was vital to approach this decision with caution and pragmatism, as the outcomes of my actions could be far-reaching and have a profound impact not only on my life but the lives of those around me."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Silence: This is an important word in the sentence, denoting a form of respect or mourning that is taking place, often carried out as a sign of honor or remembrance towards a person who has recently passed away. 2. Civil engineer: Shown twice in the sentence, this term is pivotal to understanding the context. A civil engineer is a professional who designs, builds, and maintains public works, like roads or bridges. It specifies the occupation of the person being mourned and also who the silence is honored for. 3. Observed: This word brings about the action happening in the sentence. The act of observing silence suggests a conscious and deliberate act of respect towards the civil engineer who has passed away. Without this word, we would not understand that an action is taking place in response to the death. 4. City centre: This phrase brings a geographical element to the sentence. It tells us where the silence is being observed. This could suggest it's being carried out in a public or significant space, which may imply that the deceased civil engineer had a significant impact on the city or was well-respected within the community. 5. Death: This word introduces a very significant event to the sentence. Without it, we wouldn't be aware of the gravity of the situation. It indicates that the silence is a result of someone's passing, making it a primary word. 6. Last Thursday: The term suggests the timing of the event when the civil engineer passed away. It gives us a timeframe within which the events have occurred. In conclusion, the most salient words in the sentence, those that convey the core meaning and context are 'silence', 'civil engineer', 'observed', 'city centre', 'death', and 'last Thursday'. Each word or phrase serves to build upon the overall context and emotion behind the sentence.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine.  Question: suppose Weaker hurricanes will be formed happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"The process you've described pertains to the functioning of the human renal system, specifically, the kidneys. The kidneys operate by filtering blood, allowing waste and fluid to pass while preventing larger molecules from passing through. This filtered fluid then returns to the bloodstream, and the remaining waste is eliminated from the body in the form of urine. Regarding the posed question, it appears to be asking how the formation of weaker hurricanes might impact the efficiency of waste removal in the body. Given that hurricanes are natural meteorological phenomena, and renal function is a physiological process in the human body, their relationship seems unrelated.  The removal of waste by the kidneys is dependent on several internal physiological factors such as fluid and electrolyte balance, blood pressure, kidney function, dietary intake, etc. These factors can, of course, be influenced by external factors such as dehydration prompted by extreme heat, but it doesn't directly involve atmospheric occurrences like hurricanes. Therefore, the answer would be C: no effect. The formation of weaker hurricanes should not affect the bodily waste removal process as the two are not directly connected or dependent upon each other. Changes in weather, such as a difference in hurricane strength, would not directly influence the physiological processes responsible for waste removal in the human body. However, if we must consider indirect links, such as weaker hurricanes leading to fewer floods, fewer water-borne diseases, and therefore less strain on the kidneys, the effect would still be too tangential and indirect to have noticeable impacts on kidney function. These underlying premises are not to deny that the environment can impact health. There certainly are health impacts from weather events and long-term changes in weather patterns. Heatwaves, for instance, can dry out the body, potentially putting more workload on the kidneys to manage the body's hydration. Cold weather can narrow blood vessels, reducing blood flow to organs. Still, the complexity and resilience of human bodies typically handle these changes without significant impacts on waste removal. To make it clear, a weather event like a hurricane, whether weaker or stronger, should not directly influence the amount of waste our body produces or how our kidneys remove that waste. Thus the correlation between the two appears non-existing, and weaker hurricanes should have no effect on the amount of waste being removed from the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Connecting with Patients Dr. Paris often treats several generations of a family over many years. \\"He's seen us through two births, one operation, multiple earaches, a broken wrist and a recovery from a serious traffic crash,\\" says Jill Farrow, a 43-year-old lawyer whose first visit to Dr. Paris was as a teenager. During the birth of her younger son, Farrow began bleeding badly. Dr. Paris managed to solve the problem in a delicate procedure. \\"Twenty years ago, she probably would have died,\\" he says. Today, when he performs school sports physical examinations for the Farrow boys, 10 and 11, he is always reminded that lives are changed forever by doctors just doing their jobs. To be a mix of country doc and somewhat adventurer, the 55-year-old family physician moved to Hailey after completing his residency . He hoped to practice medicine there and ski at nearby Sun Valley. Unfortunately, the only job opening was for an emergency-room doctor in Missoula, Montana, 300 miles away. Dr. Paris took it. \\"I'd ski all day and then drive all night to be in Missoula for a 48-hour shift,\\" he recalls. \\"I'm lucky to be alive.\\" Knowing he couldn't keep up with his eight-hour commute , he began taking flying lessons. In 1981, Dr. Paris joined a small medical practice in Hailey, a former mining town with a population at the time of 2,109. As Hailey grew in the shadow of Sun Valley's booming popularity, Dr. Paris's own practice expanded to seven physicians, including his wife, Kathryn Woods, who is also a family doctor. They met in 1986 at a certification exam in Denver when, in a room full of men in stodgy suits, Woods arrived wearing a Lycra biking outfit and carrying the front wheel of her bicycle (which she couldn't lock up outside). Dr. Paris asked her out on the spot. In 1989, they married.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The last step of the process after successfully sending the rocket carrying the satellite into space would be to establish communication with the satellite, monitor its performance, and perform any necessary adjustments to ensure its successful operation in orbit. 1. Establish communication with the satellite: Once the satellite reaches its designated orbit, the ground control team needs to establish communication with it. This is done through a network of ground stations that transmit and receive signals from the satellite. The communication link enables the team to assess the satellite's health, transmit commands, and receive data from its instruments and payload. 2. Monitor the satellite's performance: After establishing communication, the ground control team continuously monitors the satellite's performance parameters, such as its power levels, temperature, and positioning. This helps to ensure that the satellite operates optimally in the harsh environment of space and can carry out its intended purpose effectively. 3. Perform orbit adjustments if necessary: The satellite's initial orbit may not be perfect, requiring the team to make minor adjustments to fine-tune its position. This could involve using the satellite's onboard propulsion system to change its altitude or inclination, ensuring that it remains in the desired orbit for the duration of its mission. 4. Calibrate instruments and payload: After positioning the satellite in the right orbit, the team calibrates its onboard instruments and payload to ensure their accuracy and reliability. This may involve adjusting the sensitivity of scientific instruments or updating software to process the data collected by these instruments. 5. Conduct routine maintenance and updates: Throughout its lifetime, the satellite requires ongoing maintenance, both in terms of hardware and software. This includes monitoring any signs of degradation, updating software, and planning for contingencies, such as potential collisions with space debris or other satellites in orbit. 6. Analyze and utilize the data collected: As the satellite carries out its intended purpose, it generates data that needs to be collected, analyzed, and used by various stakeholders. For example, a weather satellite might provide crucial information to meteorologists, while a communications satellite might enable telecommunication and internet service providers to offer services to their customers. 7. Deorbit and decommission the satellite: Eventually, the satellite will reach the end of its operational life. At this point, it must be either deorbited, where it re-enters Earth's atmosphere and burns up, or maneuvered into a graveyard orbit, where it will no longer pose a risk to other operational satellites. Once this has been accomplished, the satellite is considered decommissioned, and the mission is complete. In conclusion, the final step in the process of launching and operating a satellite is to ensure its successful operation by establishing communication, monitoring its performance, performing necessary adjustments, analyzing the collected data, and eventually decommissioning it when its mission is complete."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They first fly to Oyster Bay, New York, on Long Island, to pick up Pam's father, retired CIA operative Jack Byrnes (De Niro), her mother Dina (Danner) and one-year-old nephew Little Jack (the son of Bob and Debbie Banks). But rather than going to the airport as planned, Jack decides to drive the family to Miami to meet the Fockers in his new RV. Once they arrive, they are greeted by Greg's eccentric but fun-loving and amiable father, Bernie (Hoffman), and mother, Roz (Streisand), who is a sex therapist for elderly couples. Worried that Jack may be put off by the Fockers' lifestyle, Greg convinces Roz to pretend that she is a yoga instructor for the weekend. Though Jack and Bernie get off to a good start, small cracks begin to form between Jack and the Fockers, due to their contrasting personalities. Things are made worse when a chase between the Fockers' dog, Moses, and the Byrnes' cat, Jinx, culminates with Jinx flushing Moses down the RV's toilet, forcing Bernie to destroy it to save Moses. Later, Bernie accidentally injures Jack's back during a game of football. Meanwhile Pam informs Greg that she's pregnant, and the two decide to keep it secret from Jack. Jack again becomes suspicious of Greg's integrity and quality, when they are introduced to the Fockers' housekeeper, Isabel Villalobos (Alanna Ubach), with whom Bernie reveals Greg had a sexual affair fifteen years before. Jack later takes the RV to Isabel's fifteen-year-old son, Jorge (Ray Santiago), to fix the toilet, but is disturbed by Jorge's striking resemblance to Greg, and the fact that Jorge never met his father, and begins to suspect he may be Greg's son with Isabel.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Mary had an easier time cleaning LEGOs than Patricia because","output":"Mary had an easier time cleaning LEGOs than Patricia because she had developed an efficient and systematic approach specifically designed for cleaning these small plastic pieces. Over time, Mary learned various tips and tricks that significantly reduced the time and effort required to clean LEGOs, making the process a breeze for her compared to Patricia's tedious methods. First, Mary had a clear understanding of the type of dirt or stains her LEGOs had accumulated. This allowed her to decide on the most effective cleaning solution and method. In some cases, a simple solution of mild dish soap and water was sufficient, while in others, she might have used a more powerful cleaner meant for tough, built-up grime. Second, Mary organized her LEGOs before cleaning them, which helped her work more efficiently. She would separate the pieces by color, type, and complexity, enabling her to clean large batches of similar pieces together. This method speeded up the drying process as well, as small, simple pieces would dry more quickly than larger, intricate ones. Another aspect of Mary's cleaning mastery was her use of appropriate tools. She had a collection of brushes and cleaning tools specifically tailored for the task. For example, she would utilize a soft toothbrush to get into the hard-to-reach spaces between the LEGO bricks, ensuring thorough cleaning without damaging the pieces. She also had a fine sieve or mesh bag that she used to keep the small pieces together during the washing and rinsing process, preventing them from getting lost or damaged. Furthermore, Mary took advantage of natural, non-toxic cleaning solutions whenever possible. This not only minimized her exposure to harsh chemicals but also helped protect the environment. She was well-versed in using everyday household items such as baking soda, vinegar, and lemon juice as effective cleaning agents. This knowledge enabled her to remove stubborn stains and dirt without compromising the integrity of her LEGO pieces. Moreover, Mary had a proper drying method that prevented water spots and further dirt accumulation on her freshly cleaned LEGOs. She would gently shake off excess water, lay the pieces on a clean, dry towel, and let them air dry for several hours or overnight. In some cases, she might also use a hairdryer on the cool setting to speed up the process, ensuring the pieces were thoroughly dry before reassembling and storing them. Lastly, Mary maintained a regular cleaning schedule for her LEGO collection. By making it a habit to clean her LEGOs periodically, she avoided the buildup of grime and dirt that would make the cleaning process more challenging. This maintenance routine kept her collection in pristine condition, reducing the need for deep cleaning sessions. In contrast, Patricia lacked the organizational skills, tools, and knowledge that Mary possessed. Consequently, she struggled with the cleaning process, finding it time-consuming and frustrating. Mary's systematic and well-informed approach to cleaning her LEGOs made the task more manageable and efficient, which contributed to her overall success and ease with the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They have a diameter of about 11.6 mm and a height of about 5.4 mm, which is similar to the R44 specifications. The LR44 designation is actually a common name for an alkaline battery that is equivalent to the 357 battery. The LR prefix indicates that it is an alkaline type, while the 44 denotes the battery size. The 357 battery, generally a silver oxide battery, often holds a bit more capacity and has a more stable output voltage throughout its life. Both types of batteries are interchangeable in most cases as they share the same dimensions and voltage output. However, silver oxide 357 batteries are known to have a more consistent discharge rate, making them more suitable for precision devices like watches. Alkaline LR44 batteries tend to be more affordable and are more readily available in most stores."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What is the profession shared by Philip Glass and Antonio Salieri Answer:","output":"Philip Glass and Antonio Salieri are both renowned composers in the field of classical music. While their music styles and historical contexts may differ significantly, their shared profession lies in creating, arranging, and producing musical compositions that have made lasting impacts on the music world. Philip Glass is an American composer born in 1937, known for his minimalist and repetitive compositions. With a career spanning over half a century, Glass has composed operas, symphonies, chamber music, and film scores. Some of his most notable works include the operas \\"Einstein on the Beach\\" and \\"Satyagraha,\\" as well as the film score for \\"Koyaanisqatsi.\\" Antonio Salieri, an Italian composer born in 1750, rose to prominence during the Classical era. Serving as a court composer for the Austrian emperor, Salieri composed operas, orchestral, and sacred music. While he was a contemporary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, his works have often been overshadowed by those of his more famous peer. However, he did contribute a significant amount to the development of Western classical music, with popular works such as the opera \\"Tarare\\" and the sacred composition \\"Requiem in C minor.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Beautiful South was an English pop/rock group formed in 1988 by two former members of the Hull group the HousemartinsPaul Heaton and Dave Hemingwayboth of whom performed lead and backing vocals. Other members throughout the band's tenure were former Housemartins roadie Sean Welch (bass), Dave Stead (drums) and Dave Rotheray (guitar). After the band's first album (recorded as a quintet), they were joined by a succession of female vocalists, all of whom performed lead and backing vocals alongside Heaton and Hemingway  Briana Corrigan for albums two and three after appearing as a guest vocalist on one, followed by Jacqui Abbott for the fourth through seventh albums, and finally Alison Wheeler for the final three Beautiful South albums.  - The Housemartins were an English alternative rock band formed in Hull who were active in the 1980s. Many of the Housemartins' lyrics were a mixture of Marxist politics and Christianity, reflecting singer Paul Heaton's beliefs at the time (the back cover of \\"London 0 Hull 4\\" contained the message, \\"Take Jesus  Take Marx  Take Hope\\"). The group's cover version of the Isley Brothers' \\"Caravan of Love\\" was a UK Number 1 single in December 1986.  - Alison Wheeler (born 4 March 1972) is a British singer, best known as the female vocalist for The Beautiful South from 2003 until they disbanded in 2007.  - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions.  - The East Riding of Yorkshire, or simply East Yorkshire, is a ceremonial county of England. It is located in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber. The East Riding of Yorkshire may also refer to a local government district with unitary authority status, which does not include the city of Kingston upon Hull, the largest settlement in the ceremonial county, which is a separate unitary authority. The modern East Riding of Yorkshire (both ceremonial county and unitary authority), was formed in 1996 from the northern part of the non-metropolitan county of Humberside.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest.

Miffy's Adventures Big and Small (Dutch: \\"Nijntjes avonturen groot en klein\\" ) is a Dutch-British CGI-animated television series, based on the \\"Miffy\\" book series by Dutch artist Dick Bruna. It is a continuation of the \\"Miffy and Friends\\" series, which aired from 2003 until 2007. The show airs on KRO in the Netherlands. Can we infer the following? Miffy's Adventures Big and Small uses human actors","output":"No, we cannot infer that Miffy's Adventures Big and Small uses human actors. The show, Miffy's Adventures Big and Small, is a Dutch-British CGI-animated television series. CGI stands for Computer-Generated Imagery, which implies that the characters, settings, and animations in the series are created using computer software and digital techniques rather than being portrayed by human actors. The original \\"Miffy\\" book series, authored by Dutch artist Dick Bruna, features the character Miffy, a small rabbit, as the main protagonist. This series has evolved over the years and led to the development of the \\"Miffy and Friends\\" television series in 2003, which concluded in 2007. Later, Miffy's Adventures Big and Small was created as a continuation of the Miffy and Friends series. The show's animation utilizes CGI, which enables the creators to bring the characters to life on-screen while maintaining the unique, simple yet captivating visual aesthetics of the original Miffy book illustrations. Besides, CGI animation allows the storytelling to be visually engaging and dynamic without the need for human actors. Moreover, the show is aired on KRO, a Dutch television network, targeting primarily children who appreciate and enjoy the colorful, imaginative, and endearing world that the Miffy's Adventures Big and Small series offers. In conclusion, the statement that Miffy's Adventures Big and Small uses human actors is incorrect. The show is a CGI-animated television series based on the beloved \\"Miffy\\" book series and is focused on capturing the essence of the original illustrations while delivering engaging animated storytelling experiences for its target audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An enraged Muslim mob beat a Christian couple to death in Pakistan and burnt their bodies in a brick kiln where they worked on Tuesday for allegedly desecrating a Koran, police said.

Another police official confirmed the incident. The victims were only identified by their first names, Shama and Shehzad, and were a married couple. Pakistan's brick kiln workers are often subject to harsh practices, with a study by the Bonded Labour Liberation Front Pakistan estimating that 4.5 million are indentured labourers.

It implies that the boy in question possesses or is characterized by a Mohawk and sunglasses. In the second sentence: \\"A boy with a Mohawk and sunglasses.\\" the preposition \\"with\\" is used to denote accompanying or possession.

Factors in blood are involved in clotting. When you bleed, your body begins a coagulation cascade of reactions, involving special proteins known as coagulation factors, to stop that bleeding. When one or more of these clotting factors are missing, there is a higher chance of having dificulties stoping the bleeding. Hemophiliacs lacking the normal Factor VIII are said to have Hemophilia A (or Factor VIII deficiency), the most common form. Hemophilia is a genetic disease, passed down through family. It is linked to the X-chromosome, so it mostly affects males. F8 is the gene for the Factor VIII protein. Mutations in the F8 gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII, or reduce the amount of the protein. The altered or missing protein cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process.   Q: What is the term for diseases in which blood does not clot normally?

Process: - Body temperature rises - The brain tells blood vessels to dilate - The sweat glands become active - Moisture is released from the pores - The moisture evaporates - The evaporation causes cooling.  Question: suppose less moisture evaporates happens, how will it affect MORE body cooling occurring.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"less effect Explanation: Step 1: Body temperature rises. Step 2: The brain tells blood vessels to dilate. Step 3: The sweat glands become active. Step 4: Moisture is released from the pores. Step 5: The moisture evaporates. Step 6: The evaporation causes cooling. If less moisture evaporates, it means that a smaller amount of sweat turns into vapor. Since evaporation is the primary method through which our bodies release heat, reducing the amount of moisture that evaporates will lead to less cooling occurring. Therefore, the supposed perturbation (less moisture evaporating) will have a 'less effect' on the cooling of the body."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

What was the name of the robot in the 1951 film, 'The Day The Earth Stood Still'????","output":"The iconic robot featured in the 1951 science fiction film 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' is named Gort. This classic film was directed by Robert Wise and based on the short story \\"Farewell to the Master\\" by Harry Bates. It is widely recognized as one of the pioneering films in the genre and has left a lasting impact on popular culture. Gort is a large humanoid robot with a smooth, metallic exterior that seems indestructible. He does not verbally communicate with humans but is extremely powerful, possessing advanced technologies and capabilities that allow him to neutralize virtually any weapon or threat. Gort is an important character in the film, playing the role of an enforcer who accompanies the extraterrestrial visitor Klaatu in his mission to deliver an ultimatum to Earth. The story is set in the context of the Cold War, where humanity's technological advancements, particularly in the nuclear arsenal, raise concerns among the inhabitants of other planets. Klaatu and Gort arrive on Earth as representatives of an interstellar federation that plans to maintain peace in the universe. They threaten humanity with catastrophic consequences if they do not abandon their destructive ways and pursue a more peaceful existence. Gort's presence serves as a constant reminder of the extent to which this alien federation is willing to enforce peace. His abilities are put on display on several occasions throughout the film, leaving the human characters in awe of his power. Gort is a symbol of the potential consequences that mankind may face if they refuse to cooperate, as well as an illustration of the advanced technology and capabilities that alien civilizations possess. Over the years, Gort has gained a cult following and is regarded as one of the most memorable robots in the history of cinema. His appearance and character have influenced numerous subsequent film and television portrayals of robots, androids, and other sci-fi beings. In 2008, a remake of 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' was released, introducing Gort to new generations, though the original film and Gort's portrayal in it continue to be widely admired and appreciated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- As Egypt marked the third anniversary of the January 25 revolution, many of the activists associated with it were behind bars, awaiting trial, or facing a vilification campaign that turned heroes into traitors. Meanwhile, the police whose brutal force stoked their anger three years ago vowed to protect the weekend celebrations. Wael Ghonim, the Google executive behind the Facebook page that helped mobilize support for the mass demonstrations in 2011, is living in self-imposed exile in the UAE. \\"[I took] the decision to stay away since Egypt doesn't welcome people like me anymore,\\" he wrote in a letter published on his Facebook page on January 7, breaking six months of silence since the military removed President Mohamed Morsy from power in July last year.

Human rights groups have continuously condemned the Egyptian government's crackdown on political dissent and the arbitrary arrests and detention of activists, journalists, and protesters. The ongoing suppression of basic rights has contributed to the further polarization of Egyptian society, creating a deeply divided nation. Many critics argue that the ruling regime is undermining the very principles that inspired the January 25 revolution in the first place – the demands for dignity, social justice, and democratic change. While the government claims that its measures are aimed at restoring stability and countering terrorism, several observers have pointed out that the systematic repression of opposition voices is only likely to fuel further unrest and instability in the country. Despite the grim outlook for Egypt's political landscape, some voices of dissent continue to speak out against injustice and advocate for the protection of fundamental freedoms. Social media platforms, like the Facebook page created by Wael Ghonim, still serve as important tools for grassroots activism and the dissemination of information that may not be covered by mainstream media. However, the increasing clampdown on digital spaces, including government surveillance and censorship, has further raised concerns about the shrinking space for independent voices and the overall decline of democracy in Egypt. The international community has a crucial role to play in supporting human rights and democratic principles in Egypt. By applying diplomatic pressure, offering technical assistance, and ensuring that international aid is conditional on tangible progress in human rights and good governance, foreign governments can help foster a more inclusive and accountable political system in the country. It is important to remember that the aspirations that drove the January 25 revolution still resonate with many Egyptians, and by investing in a truly representative and responsive democracy, Egypt can work toward a more stable and prosperous future for all its citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn.

His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

This the left likes. But some don’t like the political compromises Obama had to make to pass health care, some much preferring righteous indignation to useful legislation.      “Gibbs dismissed the ‘professional left’ in terms very similar to those used by their opponents on the ideological right,” Youngman went on, “saying, ‘They will be satisfied when we have Canadian health care and we’ve eliminated the Pentagon. That’s not reality.’”      It isn’t. And I’m guessing the president agrees with Gibbs and was neither angered nor disappointed by Gibbs’s statements, which came not in the heat of his daily briefing but in the cool of his West Wing office.      In other words, Gibbs knew what he was doing. And so did Obama.      Members of the left were predictably outraged by Gibbs’s statements, with one Democratic lawmaker either calling or not calling for Gibbs to resign. (The matter is under dispute.)      Having started a fight, Gibbs soon called it off, issuing a statement that said in part: “So we should all, me included, stop fighting each other.”      Press secretaries sometimes do make off-the-cuff remarks they later regret. But I don’t think this was the case here.      What really gets a press secretary in trouble is when his boss thinks he is not defending the White House and its policies vigorously enough.      Gibbs has one boss, and it isn’t the press. It’s the guy in the Oval Office.      The press often misunderstands the role of the press secretary. Reporters get angry when they think press secretaries are “too partisan.”      But press secretaries are partisan. Mike McCurry, who I think was a particularly good press secretary, never tried to disguise what his job was when he worked for Bill Clinton. “The modern presidency is defined by the manipulation of the news flow 24 hours a day,” McCurry told me.      The modern presidency doesn’t always succeed in that, of course. Events — Monica, the little blue dress, impeachment — sometimes intervene (though Clinton’s current popularity represents one of the greatest political resurrections of modern times).      And some politicians are simply better than others at handling the press. In 2000, John McCain was beloved by many in the press corps when he ran in the Republican primaries. But by 2008, things had soured.      Shortly after the election, the Columbia Journalism Review revealed that McCain’s campaign had hired a blogger “to attack” and engage in “bullying” the press during the last six months of the 2008 presidential campaign.      Gosh, that worked out well for McCain.      I very much doubt Gibbs is in any danger of losing his job. The president is more in danger of losing a guy like Gibbs, should he ever tire of getting yelled at from both below and above day after day.      Roger Simon is POLITICO’s chief political columnist.       ||||| There he goes again. What gets me is how unprofessional the whole thing is.      Look, if you’re a public figure of any kind, you’re going to face a lot of criticism. Much of it will seem unfair to you; some of the unfair criticism will come from people you expected to take your side; you’ll be angry, you’ll feel that people are putting their egos or their personal aggrandizement above the cause.      Welcome to reality. It’s my reality — and I’m just a professor/columnist. Someone actually in the White House has to be prepared for much more of this kind of thing — and if you don’t have a thick enough skin to take it, find another form of employment.      I’m not saying to turn the other cheek and always say something polite as a general principle; by all means lash out at your critics, if you have something to gain by doing so. Rudeness at the proper moment can serve a purpose — as I hope I’ve demonstrated over the years. But if you vent for the sake of venting; if you alienate people you’re going to need; then you’re just being stupid.      And that, I’m afraid, is what’s going on here. Rachel Maddow isn’t going to go away, or turn all meek, because the White House Press Secretary implicitly denounced her. Even more to the point, liberal critics have an audience because they’re reflecting real concerns of real people. Those concerns need addressing, if necessary in the form of explanations of why their expectations can’t be met. Denouncing the people giving voice to those real concerns as the “professional left” is both unfair and, as I’ve said, stupid.      And both the president and, more important, the country deserve better. |||||","output":"White House press secretary Robert Gibbs came under fire from the liberal blogosphere after telling Sam Youngman of The Hill that liberals who unfairly criticize President Barack Obama may be living in a chemically altered state. Gibbs went on to dismiss the \\"professional left\\" and compared their desire for Canadian health care and the elimination of the Pentagon to an unrealistic reality. The comments prompted outrage from the left, with some Democratic lawmakers calling for Gibbs' resignation. However, the press secretary's role is to defend the White House and its policies, and it is likely that President Obama agrees with Gibbs' statements. Ultimately, Gibbs is not in danger of losing his job, and it seems that his comments were intentional and reflective of the administration's stance on addressing internal criticism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The movie struggles to create a compelling and coherent plot, leading to a negative sentiment overall.  The directing by John Doe is underwhelming, as the camera work and scene transitions do not add to the intensity and suspense one would expect from a thriller. Instead, they leave the audience feeling alienated and disconnected from the characters, stifling any possibility of truly understanding their motives and inner turmoil. The acting performances do nothing to salvage this uninspired film. The actors seem unnatural in their delivery, and their chemistry fails to spark any genuine emotion or engagement. The protagonist, played by Jane Smith, constantly delivers a one-dimensional performance that reduces the complexity of her character to a caricature. The plot, which attempts to tackle serious social and political issues, loses itself in countless unimportant details. The numerous subplots introduced appear to be randomly thrown together, making it difficult for the viewer to follow the story and invest emotionally. The lack of depth and careless handling of sensitive subject matter ultimately create a shallow and detached experience. While the movie does have some redeeming qualities, such as beautiful cinematography and a mesmerizing score, they do not make up for the core problems with the directing, acting, and plot. Dark Secrets could have been a fruitful exploration of the human condition and the bonds we form under the direst of circumstances. Instead, it serves as a disappointing and forgettable entry in the thriller genre. In conclusion, Dark Secrets fails to deliver an engaging and thought-provoking experience.

Please answer this question: Which insect shorted out an early supercomputer and inspired the term \\"computer bug\\"?","output":"The term \\"computer bug\\" was inspired by a moth that shorted out an early supercomputer called the Harvard Mark II. The Mark II was one of the early electromechanical computers developed in the mid-20th century and was operated at the U.S. Navy's Harvard computational laboratory under the supervision of Grace Hopper, a pioneer computer scientist and U.S. Navy officer. On September 9, 1947, the operators of the Mark II found that their computer was experiencing some technical difficulties, causing it to malfunction. Upon further investigation, they discovered that a moth was lodged between two metal components, known as relays, which were used for transmitting electrical signals in the machine. Consequently, the moth's presence led to a short circuit, and the computer's performance was negatively affected. The term \\"bug\\" had already been used in engineering to describe a glitch or a malfunction prior to this incident. However, this particular circumstance involving an actual insect provided a visual representation of the issue and added a somewhat humorous dimension to the concept of a computer bug. Grace Hopper and her team physically removed the moth from the system and taped it into the computer's logbook. They wrote \\"First actual case of bug being found\\" next to the moth, along with the date and other details of the event. This event, combined with Hopper's later achievements and various contributions in the field of computer science, led to the popularization of the term \\"computer bug\\" in reference to software or hardware issues that disrupt the proper functioning of computer systems. Today, the term \\"bug\\" is widely used in the field of computer science and software engineering for describing faults, errors, or defects in a computer program or system that produce unintended or incorrect results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These methods help organizations understand and quantify the value customers perceive in their products or services, enabling them to prioritize improvements and better meet customer needs. Here's how we can break down the process step-by-step to understand and quantify customer value: 1. Identify customer needs: Begin by determining the needs and preferences of your customers. This can be done through surveys, interviews, focus groups, or directly observing customer behavior. 2. Map customer journeys: Map out the entire customer journey, from initial awareness to post-purchase support, to identify touchpoints where customer value can be enhanced. 3. Calculate value: Assign quantitative values to different aspects of your product or service based on their relative importance to customers. This can be done using tools such as the Kano Model, Customer Lifetime Value calculations, and Conjoint Analysis. 4. Identify areas for improvement: Analyze your customer journey maps and value calculations to identify areas where your product or service can be improved to better meet customer needs and enhance their perceived value. 5. Prioritize improvements: Evaluate the potential impact and complexity of proposed changes, and prioritize improvements based on their potential to increase customer value. 6. Implement changes: Make the necessary changes in your processes to maximize customer value. Monitor the results, gather customer feedback, and refine the changes as needed. 7. Continuously iterate: Continuously analyze and optimize your offerings based on ongoing changes in customer needs, preferences, and market conditions.

It has a lot of different events. Students go there to show how much they know about the science of music, biology, chemistry and others. My best event is forestry  . This time, I went to the Olympiad with my school's team. We had worked hard, but this was the state competition. It would be hard to win. The Olympiad was out of town, so we got to ride on a bus and stay in a hotel for a night. The Olympiad was in three big rooms. When we got there, we set up our team's \\"camp\\" off to one side.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"Less effect. When the atoms become more stable, it means that their nuclei have a more balanced ratio of protons to neutrons. This stability reduces the likelihood of the atoms undergoing radioactive decay processes like alpha or beta decay. As a result, there will be less of a need for the atoms to split apart to regain stability, leading to a decreased frequency of atomic splitting events. Hence, the supposed perturbation of increased atomic stability will have a less effect on more atoms splitting apart."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

The Hohenzollern prince's candidacy was withdrawn under French diplomatic pressure, but Otto von Bismarck goaded the French into declaring war by altering a telegram sent by William I.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him. She longed just to be alone with him and have him take her in his arms. Question: When the White Queen finds out that Nicolette left, she is: === The answer to the above question is A:","output":": Angry. The passage presents a scenario filled with fear and tension, as Nicolette is deeply concerned about the consequences of her actions. It is mentioned that the White Queen (Queen Blanche) is a staunch supporter of Amalric and would be furious if she discovered that Nicolette was involved in any scandalous behavior. The passage also explains the consequences as it states, \\"If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric.\\" Considering the nature of Nicolette's meeting with the troubadour, and her awareness of how the palace would react to such a scandal, it is reasonable to assume that the White Queen's reaction would be that of anger and displeasure. This assumption is based on the given context and the expectations laid out by the narrative. Consequently, the best answer among the given options is \\"Angry,\\" as it matches the projected response of the White Queen upon learning about Nicolette's actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They debated whether or not to buy antique or modern furniture as the  OPT: +antique look was more contemporary.; +modern look was more contemporary.;","output":"They debated whether or not to buy antique or modern furniture as the modern look was more contemporary, taking various factors into account such as the overall aesthetic goal for the room, the durability and functionality of both styles, as well as their personal preferences. The antique look offered a touch of refined elegance and a sense of timelessness that could elevate the atmosphere of the space, bringing in a unique charm and showcasing their appreciation for craftsmanship and history. On the other hand, the modern look boasted clean lines, sleek designs, and innovative materials that would not only provide a stylish and up-to-date appearance, but also cater to their practical needs, such as ergonomics and adaptability. As they delved deeper into their design choices, they considered the pieces they planned to place in the room and how these choices would fit into their overall décor vision. They thought about the color schemes they preferred, and pondered on whether the warmth and richness of antique furniture, with its beautifully preserved patina, would harmoniously blend with their chosen hues, or if the simpler, more streamlined modern furniture, with its wide range of colors and finishes, would allow for a more seamless integration. Taking a closer look at the construction and materials used, they weighed the pros and cons concerning durability, maintenance, and eco-friendliness. Antique furniture often came with a story and a history, crafted with high-quality wood and built to withstand the test of time, making it a sustainable choice. Consequently, this furniture could be more difficult to maintain, with the risk of damage or the need for restoration looming. Conversely, modern furniture, while being easier to care for, might include materials like particleboard or mass-produced items that could negatively impact the environment. Furthermore, they debated how each style would reflect their personalities and lifestyles. They wondered if the sophistication and classic appeal of antique furniture would effectively demonstrate their taste and passion for the past, while providing a cozy and welcoming atmosphere for family and friends. Alternatively, they questioned if their desires to maintain a cutting-edge, chic, and clutter-free environment favored the minimalist and practical design principles of modern furniture. Finally, there was the matter of their budget. They had to factor in the possible costs associated with sourcing, purchasing, and potentially restoring antique pieces, as well as the availability and accessibility of modern furnishings that catered to a range of budgets. They also considered the potential for both styles to serve as valuable investments, noting the enduring appeal of antiques and the rising demand for modern design classics. Ultimately, they knew their decision would be based on a thoughtful analysis and careful evaluation of all these variables, ensuring that the choice they made would lead to a harmonious and visually stunning space that encapsulated their distinctive styles, accommodated their functional needs, and manifested their creative aspirations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: In the Land of the Head Hunters Movie plot: Original advertising for the film describes it as a drama of primitive life on the shores of the North Pacific. The action takes place during the time of the first exploration of the Coast; an early scenario has the film opening with Vancouvers ship coming into the bay, though that part did not make it into the final film.The story overlays three plot elements onto each other: a melodramatic love triangle; an equally melodramatic series of aboriginal battles (from which the Head Hunting title is drawn); and a full range of Kwakwakawakw ceremonial performances in regalia fully restored for the film. The hero, Motana, falls in love with the maid of his dreams, Naida, while on a vision quest. Unfortunately for him, Naida is betrothed to an evil sorcerer. After completing his quest, Motana embarks on a battle to win Naida by killing the evil sorcerer. As might be expected, the sorcerers equally unsavory brother, Yaklus, is outraged. He takes his revenge by ransacking Motanas village, killing his father, and stealing Naida for himself. Strangely, the most magnificent Kwakwakawakw dance ceremonies in the film come in celebration of Yakluss success. But then, Motana and his crew stage a dramatic rescue of Naida from the bedside of Yaklus. A remarkable canoe chase ensues, at the end of which the sorcerers brother meets his doom in the deadly gorge of Hyal.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"Two men are standing outdoors on a sunny day holding pieces of a new item, possibly a small grill, while one of the men studies the assembly instructions.\\" if \\"two men prepare the grill for the party\\"?","output":"In order to determine if it is possible to conclude that \\"two men are standing outdoors on a sunny day holding pieces of a new item, possibly a small grill, while one of the men studies the assembly instructions,\\" based on the initial statement, \\"two men prepare the grill for the party,\\" we need to analyze each aspect of the new, more detailed statement. We will consider the context, the environment, the condition of the grill, and the men's actions. 1. Context: The initial statement is about two men preparing a grill for a party. The more detailed statement also refers to two men trying to figure out how to assemble a new item, which is possibly a small grill. Hence, the context of both descriptions remains consistent and relevant. 2. Environment: In the initial statement, there is no mention of whether the two men are indoors or outdoors. However, the more detailed statement mentions that they are outdoors on a sunny day. While it is reasonable to assume that grilling would typically take place outdoors, especially if it is for a party, this additional environmental detail is not explicitly mentioned in the initial statement. 3. Condition of the grill: The initial statement does not provide information about whether the grill is new or has been used before. However, the detailed statement suggests that the grill is a new item. Due to the lack of information in the initial statement, it is difficult to determine whether this detail aligns with the original description. 4. Men's actions: The initial statement mentions that two men are preparing the grill for the party. In the detailed statement, one of the men is studying assembly instructions, indicating that the grill requires assembly. Assembling a grill could fall within the definition of \\"preparing\\" the grill, but the term \\"preparing\\" could also refer to cleaning an already-assembled grill or getting it ready to use. Therefore, although the men's actions are related between both statements, it is not entirely evident whether the two descriptions are consistent. Based on the analysis, it cannot be conclusively determined that \\"two men are standing outdoors on a sunny day holding pieces of a new item, possibly a small grill, while one of the men studies the assembly instructions\\" is entirely consistent with the initial statement, \\"two men prepare the grill for the party.\\" Although the context of both statements is relevant, and there is an overlap in the men's actions, the additional details related to the environment and the condition of the grill are not clearly established in the initial statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity,\\" according to Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.

Here is a goal: fluff pillows in a dryer How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To fluff pillows in a dryer, here's a step-by-step guide to accomplish the goal: Step 1: Check the pillow's care label Before attempting to fluff pillows in a dryer, it's essential to verify whether the pillows are dryer-safe by checking their care labels. Some materials, like memory foam or latex, are not suitable for machine drying. Step 2: Remove pillowcases Take off any pillowcases or protective covers from the pillows, as these can be laundered separately according to their care instructions. Step 3: Inspect the pillows Check the pillows for any damage, such as tears or holes, as these could worsen during the drying process. If you find any damage, consider repairing it before proceeding or using a pillow protector. Step 4: Load the pillows into the dryer Place the pillows in the dryer, taking care not to overload the machine. It's best to dry only two pillows at a time to ensure proper airflow and even drying.  Step 5: Add dryer balls or clean tennis balls To help fluff the pillows and prevent clumping of the filling, add two or three dryer balls or clean tennis balls inside the dryer. The balls will help beat the pillows as they tumble, keeping them fluffy and well-distributed. Step 6: Set the dryer cycle Select a low-heat or air-fluff setting on the dryer, as high temperatures can potentially damage the pillow's filling material, especially if it's synthetic. Set the timer for approximately 20-30 minutes, depending on the size and thickness of the pillows. Step 7: Check the pillows periodically Monitor the drying process by pausing the dryer and checking the pillows every 10 minutes. Fluff and reposition them to ensure they dry evenly. Step 8: Confirm the pillows are completely dry Once the timer has ended, check the pillows for any dampness or moisture. If necessary, run the dryer for additional short intervals until the pillows are fully dry. Damp pillows can develop mold or mildew, which is harmful to your health. Step 9: Remove the pillows from the dryer When the pillows are completely dry, carefully remove them from the dryer. Step 10: Fluff the pillows manually Give the pillows a few good fluffs by hand to ensure that the filling is adequately distributed and lofted. This also helps to restore their original shape. Step 11: Replace the pillowcases Put the pillowcases or protective covers back on the pillows, and place them on the bed or couch.

Process:  - Blood is sent to the liver - The liver uses chemicals and proteins to treat the blood - The blood is cleaned - Energy is produced - The blood leaves the liver cleaned.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose You go to your doctor more often happens, how will it affect you develop more alcoholism.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in question implies that increasing the frequency of doctor visits may have an impact on the development of alcoholism. This hypothesis is based on the idea that frequent doctor visits may potentially have a direct or indirect effect on the liver's process of maintaining blood health. While the liver's core functions, such as filtering and transforming blood, producing energy, and cleaning blood, are not directly affected by increasing doctor visits, an indirect effect could be observed in various ways that may impact the development of alcoholism. In this context, it is essential to examine different factors that connect the liver's functions and potential consequences of frequent doctor visits. 1. Early detection and prevention: Regular doctor visits may lead to the early detection and treatment of any liver-related issues, such as liver disease, inflammation, or abnormal liver function, which can be partially attributed to excessive alcohol consumption. Early intervention plays a crucial role in delaying or preventing the development of alcoholism and related liver complications. The enhanced medical attention can guide individuals away from risky drinking patterns and promote better overall liver health. 2. Improved awareness and education: During frequent doctor visits, healthcare professionals have the chance to provide education on the detrimental effects of excessive alcohol consumption on an individual's liver and overall health. This increased awareness and understanding of the risks associated with alcohol abuse may encourage individuals to be more mindful of their alcohol intake, lessening the chances of developing an alcohol use disorder. 3. Medical interventions and support: If a patient has an increased risk of developing alcoholism, regular doctor visits can ensure appropriate medical management and treatment options are in place, including counseling, therapy, or medications that aid in alcohol addiction recovery. Continuous support and follow-up from healthcare professionals may contribute to more successful outcomes in managing alcoholism and preventing severe liver damage. 4. Monitoring of liver function: Through regular doctor visits, liver function can be closely monitored, allowing the doctor to notice any potential disruptions in liver function early on. Establishing a baseline of liver function enables healthcare professionals to detect and respond quickly to any abnormalities related to alcohol consumption, potentially mitigating the development of alcoholism and its damaging effects on the liver. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation suggests that going to the doctor more often might indirectly affect the development of alcoholism but not the core liver functions. However, it is through early detection, prevention, education, intervention, and ongoing monitoring of liver health that frequent doctor visits could lead to a reduction in alcoholism's risk and associated liver complications. While the perturbation itself does not directly impact the liver's blood maintenance functions, it can help mitigate the progression of alcoholism, reducing the potential harm to the liver over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The artist, James Harlan Corbin [Lederer], does not wish to sell the painting. Nonplussed, Earl returns to his office and phones Corbin with his proposal to sell. Again, Corbin refuses. Earl continues his pursuit to find out who the model for the painting was. He learns it is Helen North, a young woman who looks nothing like the woman in the painting. He visits with her to learn his location, but she refuses, telling him that she will be singing at a local nightclub, where Corbin frequents. Earl finds both of them in the museum, and again confronts Corbin. Becoming clearly annoyed, Corbin invites the singer out for a night in his yacht. She agrees, but is later found washed ashore. Although Police Lt. Roberts initially questions Helen's suitor Hunt Mason, Mason implicates Corbin as the last person who saw Helen North. John Earl works with the police department to arrange for Helen's sister Linda to apply for modeling, in order to spy on Corbin. The two return to Corbin's boathouse.

This character is Othello, the protagonist of the play \\"Othello, the Moor of Venice.\\"  Othello is a Moorish general in the Venetian army who becomes the tragic hero of the story. He is a courageous and skilled military leader, respected for his prowess in battle. Born in North Africa, Othello is a Moor, which refers to the Muslim inhabitants of the Maghreb, the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily, and Malta during the Middle Ages. In the play, his ethnicity plays a significant role as it makes him an outsider in Venetian society, leading to a sense of isolation and vulnerability. Throughout the play, Othello is subjected to racism and prejudice from other characters due to his cultural and racial background. This eventually contributes to his downfall as he becomes the victim of a malicious plot by Iago, one of the central antagonists in the story. Iago manipulates Othello's trust and insecurities, turning him against his wife, Desdemona, and driving him to acts of jealousy and rage. In conclusion, the answer to \\"Who was Shakespeare's Moorish general?\\" is an entity, specifically referring to the fictional character Othello from the play \\"Othello, the Moor of Venice.\\" Othello is a tragic figure whose life is marred by his status as an outsider in the society he serves and his susceptibility to manipulation by those he trusts.

He is more popularly known as the earthly father of the Pandavas. He was said to be a great warrior and expanded his kingdom during his rule.  - The Mahabharata or Mahbhrata (US ; UK  \\"\\") is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the \\"Ramayana\\".  - In Indian epic poetry, Vasudeva (Devanagari , IAST \\") is the father of Krishna. He was the brother of cowherds tribe chieftain Nanda Baba who was a Surasena who was foster father of Lord Krishna. His sister Kunti was married to Pandu. Kunti plays a big role later in the war Mahabharata.  Vasudeva was a partial incarnation of Rishi Kashyapa.  The patronymic \\" (with long \\"\\") is a popular name of Krishna. According to the Harivansa Purana, Vasudeva and Nanda were brothers.  - Hindu Mythology is large figure of mythical narratives in Hinduism found in Hindu texts such as the epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana, Ancient Tamil literature (such as the Sangam literature and Periya Puranam), several other regional literature of South Asia. As such, it is a subset of mainstream Indian and Nepali culture. Rather than one consistent, monolithic structure, the same myth appears in various versions, varies with diverse traditions, developed by different sects, people and philosophical schools, in different regions and at different times, which are not necessarily held by all Hindus to be literal accounts of historical events, but are taken to have deeper, often symbolic, meaning, and which have been given a complex range of interpretations.  - The Ramayana (\\"\\") is an ancient Indian epic poem which narrates the struggle of the divine prince Rama to rescue his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana. Along with the \\"Mahabharata\\", it forms the Sanskrit \\"Itihasa\\".  - Arjuna (in Devanagari:  \\"\\") along with Krishna is the protagonist of the ancient Indian epic \\"Mahabharata\\" and plays a key role in the Bhagavad Gita alongside Krishna. He was the third of the Pandava brothers and was married to Draupadi, Ulupi, Chitrangada and Subhadra (Krishna's sister) at different times. His children included Srutakarma, Iravan, Babruvahana, and Abhimanyu.  - In the Hindu epic \\"Mahabharata\\", Bhima (Sanskrit: ) (birth year about 3200BC) is the second of the Pandavas. The Mahabharata relates many events which portray the immense might of Bhima. Bhima is responsible for slaying all hundred Kaurava brothers in the Kurukshetra War.  - Rama (Sanskrit:  \\"Rma\\") or Sr Rmachandra (Sanskrit :  ) is the seventh avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu. He is the central figure of the Hindu epic Ramayana, which is the principal narration of the events connected to his incarnation on Earth, his ideals and his greatness. Rama is one of the many deities in Hinduism and especially of the various Vaishnava sects. Religious texts and scriptures based on his life have been a formative component in numerous cultures of South and Southeast Asia. Along with Krishna, Rama is considered to be one of the most important avatars of Vishnu. In Rama-centric sects, he is considered the Supreme Being, rather than an avatar.  - In Hindu mythology , Kunti - Bhoja ( or Kuntibhoja ) was the adoptive father and cousin of Queen Kunti . He was the ruler of the Kunti Kingdom . Kunti was a daughter of King Shurasena , but was later given to Kuntibhoja since he was devoid of children . Kuntibhoja raised her as his own daughter and loved her . She was very beautiful and intelligent and later married Pandu . When Kunti was a young girl , the sage Durvasa visited Kuntibhoja one day , and sought his hospitality . The king entrusted the sage to Kunti 's care and tasked Kunti with the responsibility of serving the sage and meeting all his needs during his stay with them . Eventually , the sage was gratified . Before departing , he rewarded Kunti by teaching her Atharvaveda mantras which enabled her to invoke any god of her choice to beget children by them . Kuntibhoja took part in the Kurukshetra War , siding with the Pandavas . He perished in the war , falling to Dronacharya .  - The Kunti Kingdom was the kingdom of Kunti-Bhoja, one of the prominent kings among the Bhoja Yadavas.  - In Mahabharata, Kunti (Kunt) or Pritha was the daughter of Shurasena, and the foster daughter of his cousin Kuntibhoja.

His kingdom was centered around the Malwa region in central India, where his capital Dhara was located. Bhoja fought wars with nearly all his neighbours in attempts to extend his kingdom, with varying degrees of success. At its zenith, his kingdom extended from Chittor in the north to upper Konkan in the south, and from the Sabarmati River in the west to Vidisha in the east.  - In the Hindu epic Mahabharata,Yudhishthira (Sanskrit: , \\"\\") was the eldest son of King Pandu and Queen Kunti and the king of Indraprastha and later of Hastinapura (Kuru).

Q:Information:  - Theoretical computer science, or TCS, is a division or subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and includes the theory of computation.  - In theoretical computer science, a computational problem is a mathematical object representing a collection of questions that computers might be able to solve. For example, the problem of factoring  - NP - hardness ( non-deterministic polynomial - time hard ) , in computational complexity theory , is a class of problems that are , informally , \`\` at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP '' . More precisely , a problem H is NP - hard when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H. As a consequence , finding a polynomial algorithm to solve any NP - hard problem would give polynomial algorithms for all the problems in NP , which is unlikely as many of them are considered hard . A common mistake is thinking that the NP in \`\` NP - hard '' stands for \`\` non-polynomial '' . Although it is widely suspected that there are no polynomial - time algorithms for NP - hard problems , this has never been proven . Moreover , the class NP also contains all problems which can be solved in polynomial time .  - In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and language, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \\"\\"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\\".\\"  - Complexity describes the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions.  - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.  - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.  - Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

That's how some in Rio have described the mood in the streets of Copacabana Beach, where hundreds of thousands of young pilgrims follow every step of visiting Pope Francis, an outspoken champion of the poor. But not everyone is celebrating in Rio. About 50 kilometers away, in the working-class suburb of Guaratiba, a last-minute change in the pope's schedule due to heavy rainfall had devastating consequences on the lives of local merchants, many whom invested their life savings on preparing for his arrival. They were expecting hundreds of thousands to flock to their community over the weekend.

Explanation: The news story just before the sentence in question is about the residents of Guaratiba and how they were affected by a last-minute change in the Pope's schedule. The most logical completion, given the context, is to indicate that the Guaratiba residents would want their voices to be heard, as they were negatively affected by the event cancellation. Incorrect Answers and why they are wrong:  - Brazil residents want their voices to be heard: While technically accurate due to the event taking place in Brazil, it is too general since the specific location is Guaratiba. - Brazilian residents want their voices to be heard: Similar to the previous point, it applies to all residents of Brazil instead of specifically indicating Guaratiba residents. - CNN residents want their voices to be heard: This choice doesn't make sense. CNN is a news organization, not a residential area. - Christian Carnival residents want their voices to be heard: While the event is called the Christian Carnival, it's not a specific location where residents live. - Copacabana Beach residents want their voices to be heard: The residents of Copacabana Beach are not the subject of the news story; the Guaratiba residents are. - Pope Francis residents want their voices to be heard: This is not a geographical location or group of residents. - Rio residents want their voices to be heard: While the event is in Rio, the specific residents being discussed are those in a suburb called Guaratiba. - Rio de Janeiro residents want their voices to be heard: Again, this is broader than the specific group discussed, which are the residents of Guaratiba."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: If you plan to add new wires or a light switches that to an existing kitchen outlet, make sure the electrical box that houses the outlet has enough room. You will have to replace the box with a larger one if it doesn’t. Use the National Electrical Code to determine the size of the electrical box. Calculate the amount of wires, devices, and clamps you will put in the box. Add 1 cubic inch for each hot and neutral wire, 2 cubic inches for each device (such as a switch), 1 cubic inch for all ground wires, and 1 cubic inch for all clamps. Take this sum and multiply it by either 2 for 14-gauge wire or 2.25 for 12-gauge wire. This calculation will give you the minimum box requirement in cubic inches. You do not have to do calculations for plastic boxes as the volume is stamped inside of them. Do this at the circuit breaker. Find the switch labeled kitchen and make sure it’s off. Test to see if the power is turned off, plug in a device such as a lamp or radio into the outlet and see if it turns on.  You can also use a receptacle tester on the outlet. The lights on the test will come on if any power still running into the outlet. While the circuit breaker may be labeled, make sure you test the outlet anyway. There may have been changes in the wiring since the box was installed, or the wiring may be defective. First, unscrew the wall plate that holds the outlet. Then, unscrew the outlet from the electrical box. Take the outlet out and disconnect any wires that are connected to it. The electrical box is nailed to a wall stud. Look around the electrical box to determine which side the stud is on. Use a flashlight if it’s too dark to see. You don’t want to saw through the stud when you are expanding the hole to hold new electrical box. Hold the new electrical box over the existing box in the wall so the expansion of the hole is on the side that isn’t nailed to a stud. Use a pencil to make an outline of where you will cut with the drywall saw. Make sure that any wiring connected to the old electrical box is loose before removing it. Pulling out the box when the wires are tight will damage the wiring. Once you are sure that wires are loose, remove the old box by using a flat pry bar. Summary:","output":"When adding new wires or light switches to an existing kitchen outlet, ensure there's enough room in the electrical box or replace it with a larger one. Use the National Electrical Code to determine box size and calculate the required volume. No calculations are needed for plastic boxes; their volume is stamped inside.

Another company, named company H, produced and distributed electricity using wind power. Both companies strive to be more efficient and to pollute less.  Which company made less fuel for trucks?  Hint: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward.

In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.

If However, evolutionary acquisition has yet to be consistently implemented with success on individual weapon system acquisitions., can we conclude that \\"Evolutionary acquisition has yet to be consistently implemented with success.\\"?","output":"Yes, we can reasonably conclude that \\"Evolutionary acquisition has yet to be consistently implemented with success.\\" However, it is essential to delve deeper into the various factors influencing the successful implementation of evolutionary acquisition in weapon system acquisitions and the challenges that need to be addressed. Evolutionary acquisition is an approach to system development that focuses on the gradual implementation of new technologies, capabilities, and features into a weapon system, allowing for incremental improvements over time. This method enables initial deployment and subsequent enhancements to be driven by advances in technology and informed by the needs of the end-users, aiming at a lower risk of failure and cost overruns. There are several reasons why evolutionary acquisition might not be consistently implemented with success in weapon system acquisitions: 1. Technical Complexity: Weapon systems are often highly complex and require a delicate balance of technical requirements, specifications, and standards. Introducing new technologies or capabilities into such a system can be challenging, particularly when it involves integrating multiple components from different suppliers or designing new interfaces. 2. Budget Constraints: Weapon systems can be costly projects, and evolutionary acquisition generally involves a long-term commitment to continually improving and upgrading a platform. This may prove challenging for organizations facing budget constraints, forcing them to prioritize other projects or limit the iterative development process. 3. Bureaucratic Hurdles: The procurement process for weapon systems can be cumbersome and bureaucratic, with extensive approvals, decision-making, and oversight at multiple levels. This may hinder the agility and flexibility required for successful evolutionary acquisition, as change and adaptation are constrained by a complex decision-making process. 4. Resistance to Change: Traditional acquisition processes can be resistant to change. Adopting a new acquisition method such as evolutionary acquisition may face resistance from stakeholders who are more comfortable with established practices, leading to a reluctance to adopt these new principles. 5.Metadata"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to the question: What was the meaning of the word that the Ancient Romans name for Gibraltar was derived from? is inside the article: During ancient times, Gibraltar was regarded by the peoples of the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.The Rock was revered by the Greeks and Romans as one of the two Pillars of Hercules, created by the demigod during his tenth labour when he smashed through a mountain separating the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. According to a Phocaean Greek traveller who visited in the sixth century BC, there were temples and altars to Hercules on the Rock where passing travellers made sacrifices. The Spanish later symbolised the importance of the Pillars of Hercules with a heraldic device consisting of a pair of columns with a scroll wrapped around them – a symbol that became the  sign and the related Portuguese cifrão ().To the Ancient Romans, Gibraltar was known as Mons Calpe, a name perhaps derived from the Phoenician word kalph, \\"hollowed out\\", presumably in reference to the many limestone caves in the Rock. It was well-known to ancient geographers, but there is no known archaeological evidence of permanent settlements from the ancient period. According to the Roman writer Avienus, the ancient Greek traveller Euctemon recorded that thirty stadia separate [the Pillars of Hercules]; [Euctemon] says that they bristle with woods all over and are always unwelcoming to seamen. Indeed he says that on those are both temples and altars to Hercules. He says that strangers sail there by boat to make offerings to the gods and depart hot foot thinking it wrong to linger ..., can you guess it ?

The furniture had short-term value. The estate's assets were divided, and the furniture was sold while the art was kept, as the furniture had short-term value. The decision to sell the furniture was primarily based on the fact that the styles and trends are constantly changing, and its value was expected to diminish over time. The heirs to the estate recognized that they would obtain a better return on their investment by selling the furniture now and investing in new, more valuable pieces that could appreciate over time. On the other hand, the art was recognized as an irreplaceable part of the family's history, as well as a representation of timeless artistic contributions. The heirs believed that preserving and maintaining the art collection was more important to the family's legacy than holding onto the quickly depreciating furniture. As they sold off the furniture, they carefully evaluated each piece to ensure that they received a fair price for their belongings, considering their historical and monetary value. The proceeds from the sales were divided amongst the family members, as they began to use their portions to start their own lives and build their separate homes. Meanwhile, the art collection remained in the family's care. They sought out expert advice on maintaining its value and preserving it for future generations. They chose to display the standout pieces in their homes, sharing their family's passion for artistic expression and appreciation with their guests, thus keeping their ancestors' legacy alive.

I won't be taking their literary advice again! I don't often despise books, but this one is horrible. It's sappy and contrived, and far too poorly written to qualify as a guilty pleasure. The characters are one dimensional and unoriginal, the flashbacks are tedious and heavy-handed, yet still fare better than the awkward attempt at a framing story in the relationship between Sidda and her sickening, plastic-molded boyfriend. I don't want to spoil the girl power/woman love thing surrounding this book, but I don't understand what the fuss is about. Try \\"Who Will Run the Frog Hospital\\" by Lorrie Moore, or \\"Sarah Phillips\\" by Andrea Lee, or ANYTHING - just leave this one alone. Is the review positive or negative? The answer to this question is:","output":"The review is negative. The reviewer expresses a strong dissatisfaction with the book they are discussing. They feel misled by friends who recommended it, and claim that they won't trust their literary advice in the future. This signals a strong reaction to the book, as they are upset enough to rethink trusting these friends with book recommendations. The reviewer uses phrases like \\"Cheesy, contrived drivel\\", \\"horrible\\", \\"sappy and contrived\\", and \\"poorly written\\" to describe the book, all of which are negative sentiments. They explicitly state that they \\"don't often despise books,\\" implying that they do, in fact, despise this one. They take issue with various elements of the book, including the writing, character development, plot structure, and overarching themes.  The characters, in the reviewer's opinion, are one-dimensional and unoriginal, suggesting that they lack depth and complexity. They believe the flashbacks are tedious and heavy-handed, meaning that the author relied too much on this narrative technique, making the story boring and the symbolism too obvious. They also criticize the relationship between the main character, Sidda, and her boyfriend as being an awkward framing story that contributes little to the overall narrative.  The reviewer concludes by recommending other books that they believe are better, specifically, \\"Who Will Run the Frog Hospital\\" by Lorrie Moore and \\"Sarah Phillips\\" by Andrea Lee, and the use of the word \\"ANYTHING\\" underlines just how lacking they found the book in question.

Premise: \\"Tickets for the shows must be reserved well in advance.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Tickets to shows should be brought right before the show.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"Tickets for the shows must be reserved well in advance,\\" the hypothesis \\"Tickets to shows should be brought right before the show\\" appears to be false. To further explore this assessment, let us delve deeper into the reasoning behind this conclusion and provide a more detailed explanation. The premise asserts that it is essential to reserve tickets for the shows well in advance. This statement implies that there might be limited tickets available for a particular show, high demand, or perhaps certain conditions that require individuals to secure their spots ahead of time. Whatever the reason, it is clear that the process of obtaining tickets necessitates an early commitment for those wishing to attend the shows. On the contrary, the hypothesis blindly suggests that one should purchase tickets right before the show. This advice directly contradicts the premise, which emphasizes the importance of advanced reservation. Waiting until the last moment to buy tickets could lead to several undesirable outcomes: 1. Unavailability: If the show is popular or has a limited number of tickets, waiting till the last moment may result in all tickets being sold out, and the person who wants to attend will miss the opportunity to do so. 2. Increased prices: In some cases, tickets for shows, concerts, or events tend to get more expensive as the event approaches. This is especially true for live performances with limited seating capacity. Waiting until the last moment may lead to having to pay a higher price for the same ticket that could have been bought at a lower price if booked in advance. 3. Limited seating options: Venues usually offer a variety of seating options at different price points. By reserving tickets in advance, you are more likely to have a wider selection of seating choices. Delaying the purchase until just before the show could limit seating options, leaving you with less desirable or more expensive seats. 4. Booking complications: When tickets are in high demand, it's not unusual for online ticketing systems to experience technical issues due to a surge in traffic. If you wait until the last minute, you run the risk of facing booking complications; for example, the website might crash, or specific payment options may not be available. 5. No time for planning and accommodations: Many people prefer to plan for shows in advance to ensure they can arrange for transportation, accommodations, time off work, or even coordinate with their friends and family. If you wait until the last moment to purchase tickets, there might not be enough time for proper planning and other necessary arrangements. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"Tickets to shows should be brought right before the show\\" is not true, as it directly contradicts the given premise. Reserving tickets for the shows well in advance is crucial to ensuring availability, reasonable pricing, desirable seating options, smoother booking experiences, and adequate time for planning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English","output":"The phrase \\"Celková výše solventnostního kapitálového požadavku\\" translates to \\"The total amount of the solvency capital requirement\\" in English. Let me expand on what this entails: The total Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) is a fundamental part of Solvency II, a European Union (EU) legislative program that introduced a harmonized EU-wide insurance regulatory scheme. Solvency II aims at ensuring that insurance companies hold enough capital to cover their risks, identifying potential issues in advance and thus safeguarding policyholders and the overall economy. The SCR is essentially the amount of funds that insurance and reinsurance companies are required to hold. This amount is calculated to ensure that the insurer will be able to meet its obligations to policyholders and beneficiaries over the next 12 months with a probability of at least 99.5%. In other words, insurers must have enough funds to survive severe losses, thus reducing the likelihood of ruin to less than 0.5% over a one-year horizon. The calculation of the total SCR can be quite complex. It takes into account various types of risks the insurance company might be exposed to, such as underwriting risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and operational risk, amongst others. These risks can be quantified based on a standard formula laid out in the Solvency II Directive, using internal models developed by the company itself, or a combination of both. It's important to note that the total SCR is not a static number – it must be recalculated at least annually, though companies often review it more frequently. This is due to the fact that an insurer's risk profile can change over time due to various incidents or business decisions, which might necessitate adjustments in the amount of required capital. To conclude, the total amount of the Solvency Capital Requirement is a key measure of an insurance company’s financial health and ability to payout claims. It is a critical tool for supervision agencies to ensure the solvency and stability of the insurance sector and protects policyholders by ensuring that companies are sufficiently capitalized to handle significant losses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the process of rock erosion. - Particles in the environment interact with rocks - The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks - The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks - The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact - The pieces of the rock are now small rocks - The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces Step 2: Consider the perturbation hypothesis. Suppose more pieces of rock are removed, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER erosion of rocks? Step 3: Examine if the perturbation has an effect (direct or indirect) on the process. - Direct effect: Since more pieces of rock are being removed in this scenario, it suggests that the same forces that cause erosion (particles interacting with rocks) are working at a greater intensity or frequency. As a result, this would most likely cause faster erosion rather than slower or less erosion, as more rocks will be broken apart and worn away. - Indirect effect: There could potentially be indirect effects on the process of rock erosion due to the perturbation hypothesis. For example, if an increase in removed rock pieces leads to an elevated concentration of particles in the environment, then the interactions between the particles and the remaining rocks could potentially be less frequent or intense compared to the original state. In this case, the consequence could be slower erosion over time. However, this impact would depend on various factors, such as the type of particles, environmental conditions, and properties of the rocks. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have an effect on the process of rock erosion, with the most direct outcome being an increase in the speed of erosion. Still, there could also be indirect consequences that could potentially lead to slower erosion in some cases, depending on various factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: And he was perfectly right.\\" Sentence 2: He had no troubles. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Determining whether the second sentence is true based on the first sentence requires a deeper analysis of the context and meaning of both sentences. Let's break down each sentence and explore their possible interpretations. Sentence 1: \\"And he was perfectly right.\\" This sentence suggests that an individual (a male, as indicated by 'he') made a decision, statement, or judgment that has been deemed entirely correct. The term \\"perfectly right\\" implies that the correctness of his action or statement is not questionable or ambiguous. However, we cannot infer anything about the person or context from this sentence alone. Sentence 2: \\"He had no troubles.\\" This sentence indicates that the same individual from the first sentence experienced no problems, difficulties, or challenges. Again, the context and nature of these 'troubles' are not specified in the sentence itself. Now, to answer the question of whether the second sentence being true if the first sentence is true, we need to examine the relationship between the two sentences. On the surface, the two sentences might seem unrelated. It is possible to be right about something and still experience troubles of various kinds. A person might make a correct decision or judgment in one aspect of life, but still struggle with problems in other areas. Therefore, we cannot automatically assume that because he was \\"perfectly right,\\" he must have \\"no troubles.\\" However, there are potential scenarios in which the first sentence being true could lead to the second sentence being true as well. For example, if the context of the situation involves a decision that ultimately resolves or avoids any possible troubles, then being \\"perfectly right\\" might indeed mean that the person experiences \\"no troubles\\" as a result of that choice. In this case, both sentences could be true. Nonetheless, without further context and information about the relationship between the two sentences, it is impossible to decisively conclude that the second sentence is true based solely on the first sentence being true."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],F={key:0},D={key:1};function R(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
