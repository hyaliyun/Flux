On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations.

It's the early evening and the last child has been picked up by her mother. Anne is relaxing on the playground carousel when someone pulls up on a motorcycle, wearing a black motorcycle helmet. She is startled as the stranger pulls out a kukri and starts spinning the carousel. The kukri is held up in the air and the terrified woman goes around until she's struck with it. Judd Austin (Leonard Mann) is the cop assigned to the case. He is called to the scene and when he gets there, he sees the girl decapitated, with her head in a bucket of water nearby. The distraught director of the center tells the officer that Anne worked there during the day and was attending night classes at Wendall College. At the hospital, Judd and his partner Taj (Joseph R. Sicari) discuss a similar case from the previous week; another girl was found decapitated and her head in a pond. They begin to question if there's any connection between the two murders. At Wendell, the administrator Miss Helene Griffin (Annette Miller) tells Judd that Anne was close to a girl named Kim Morrison (Elizabeth Barnitz). When asked if Anne had a boyfriend, Kim tells the officer that the murdered girl was indeed involved with someone but she doesn't know who it was. She assumes the man must have been married as he was depressed. Judd enters Professor Millett's anthropology class to speak with him about his murdered student in French. The professor doesn't offer much information but he introduces Judd to an exchange student named Eleanor Adjai (Rachel Ward).

Movie plot title: The Tenant Movie plot: Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski), a quiet and unassuming man, rents an apartment in Paris whose previous tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule, attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself out the window and through a pane of glass below. He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He receives a visit and a letter from one Georges Badar (Rufus), who secretly loves Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him. Gradually he changes his breakfast habits to those of Simone, and shifts from Gauloises to Marlboro cigarettes.

People love to be the first person to do something. Anything. Look no further than those annoying posts on blogs and online news stories where someone simply writes, \\"FIRST!\\" because they're celebrating being the first person to comment. Or watch any news program and see how they will report the detail of any minor celebrity in the off chance that it leads to a bigger, more exciting story. Then they can run ads that say, \\"We were the first news team to bring you the story of Jennifer Aniston's new puppy.\\" Now, imagine if you could get paid to be that cool, hip person who gets try products and services before anyone else? When everyone else is claiming to have discovered this awesome new technology gadget, you can say, \\"Oh, that? Yeah, I tried it out months ago.\\" With that pioneering (and braggart) spirit in mind, we put together a list of five jobs that let you try new things before they hit the market. You not only get paid to be the first person to try a new item, but your opinion matters. You can't beat that. CareerBuilder.com: Food workers, nurses forced to work sick. Here are five jobs that let you try an item before everyone else buys it:. 1. Video game tester. Yes, people are paid to test video games. This job isn't all fun and games, although it sort of is. But someone has to try new video games and look for flaws or glitches so programmers and designers can fix them before the release date. Consider how complicated today's video games are -- you're immersed in an interactive world that has come a long way from the 2-D world of Mario and Luigi. There are bound to be items that are overlooked, like a door that leads to nowhere or a secret code that doesn't do what it's supposed to. 2. Consumer Reports researcher. Independent testing organization Consumer Reports carries out extensive tests on products, such as cars, gadgets and home furnishings. A dedicated staff researches a product that is put through a battery of tests. They then administer a grade and detailed report for the product so that consumers know what its positive and negative attributes are. CareerBuilder.com: Have an incompetent boss? You're not alone. 3. Blogger. As blogging has shifted from a niche activity for a few writers to a respected outlet for news and topical conversations, bloggers have been granted some impressive privileges. Among them is access to conferences and company events, such as the unveiling of a new smartphone. Months before a new music player, smartphone or computer lands in your local retail store, the company announces it with great fanfare at a launch event. Bloggers who have large readership and respect in an industry are given prime seats at these events, where they can get their hands on these new gadgets minutes after they're unveiled. 4. Ice cream tester. If you thought testing video games was fun, consider the sheer joy of getting paid to try ice cream. Before you pick up a pint of a new, exotic flavor at the grocery store, someone had to make sure it was edible. For every whacky flavor like bubble gum, some food scientists tried out less successful flavors like spaghetti or pumpkin-wheatgrass. So the idea of eating ice cream for a living sounds fun until you realize it also means tasting some undesirable attempts, too. (Not to mention the damage done to your waistline.) CareerBuilder.com: Conflicting career advice: Which is right. 5. Critics. Before you see the must-see movie of the year, someone had to declare it a must-see film. Critics get to screen films weeks or months in advance so they can write a review for a magazine or newspaper before opening day. Music critics also get first stab at new albums. Record labels and movie studios give critics first access because their reviews drum up publicity for the respective projects -- and they hope the reviewers are positive, though there's no guarantee. Either way, critics get to enjoy some of pop culture's finest experiences for free. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Capote was the son of 17-year-old Lillie Mae Faulk and salesman Archulus Persons. His parents divorced when he was four, and he was sent to Monroeville, Alabama, where, for the following four to five years, he was raised by his mother's relatives. He formed a fast bond with his mother's distant relative, Nanny Rumbley Faulk, whom Truman called \\"Sook\\". \\"Her face is remarkable - not unlike Lincoln's, craggy like that, and tinted by sun and wind\\", is how Capote described Sook in \\"A Christmas Memory\\" (1956). The critical success of one of his short stories, \\"Miriam\\" (1945), attracted the attention of the publisher Bennett Cerf, resulting in a contract with Random House to write a novel. With an advance of 1,500, Capote returned to Monroeville and began Other Voices, Other Rooms, continuing to work on the manuscript in New Orleans, Saratoga Springs, New York, and North Carolina, eventually completing it in Nantucket, Massachusetts. It was published in 1948. Capote described this symbolic tale as \\"a poetic explosion in highly suppressed emotion\\". The novel is a semi-autobiographical refraction of Capote's Alabama childhood. Decades later, writing in The Dogs Bark (1973), he commented:  Other Voices, Other Rooms was an attempt to exorcise demons, an unconscious, altogether intuitive attempt, for I was not aware, except for a few incidents and descriptions, of its being in any serious degree autobiographical. Rereading it now, I find such self-deception unpardonable.  The story focuses on 13-year-old Joel Knox following the loss of his mother. Joel is sent from New Orleans to live with his father, who abandoned him at the time of his birth. Arriving at Skully's Landing, a vast, decaying mansion in rural Alabama, Joel meets his sullen stepmother Amy, debauched transvestite Randolph, and defiant Idabel, a girl who becomes his friend. He also sees a spectral \\"queer lady\\" with \\"fat dribbling curls\\" watching him from a top window. Despite Joel's queries, the whereabouts of his father remain a mystery. When he finally is allowed to see his father, Joel is stunned to find he is a quadriplegic, having tumbled down a flight of stairs after being inadvertently shot by Randolph. Joel runs away with Idabel but catches pneumonia and eventually returns to the Landing, where he is nursed back to health by Randolph. The implication in the final paragraph is that the \\"queer lady\\" beckoning from the window is Randolph in his old Mardi Gras costume. Gerald Clarke, in Capote: A Biography (1988) described the conclusion:  Finally, when he goes to join the queer lady in the window, Joel accepts his destiny, which is to be homosexual, to always hear other voices and live in other rooms. Yet acceptance is not a surrender; it is a liberation. \\"I am me\\", he whoops. \\"I am Joel, we are the same people.\\" So, in a sense, had Truman rejoiced when he made peace with his own identity. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Truman Capote was a writer who was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. When he was little, his parents separated, and he moved to Alabama to live with his mom's family. He became close to a relative named Sook. Truman wrote a lot of stories, and one day, a famous publisher liked his story and gave him a chance to write a book. He wrote a book called Other Voices, Other Rooms, which had some parts similar to his own life. The story is about a boy named Joel who goes to live in a big, old house with strange people and learns about himself.

Question: Where were Bactria, Sogdiana, and Margiana located in modern maps? Context: The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the park in whose eastern area at the end of the 19th century was under the local government control of Stretford Urban District? from the following article ?  The eastern area of the park, where the first developments took place at the end of the 19th century, was then under the local government control of Stretford Urban District; the west was controlled by the urban district of Barton-upon-Irwell. Tensions soon began to emerge between the Estates Company and Stretford Council over the provision of local services and infrastructure. In 1902, W. T. Glover & Co, a cable manufacturing company that had moved to the park from nearby Salford, built a power station next to their works to supply electricity to the rest of the park; the Estates Company had previously approached Manchester Corporation, but Stretford would not allow another local authority to supply electricity within its area.In 1901 Manchester Corporation formally proposed a merger with Stretford UDC, on the basis that Stretford's growth was due in large part to Trafford Park, the growth of which in turn was largely due to the Manchester Ship Canal. Manchester Corporation had provided one-third of the capital needed to build the ship canal, for which it had doubled its municipal debt, despite having also increased rates by 26 per cent between 1892 and 1895. Stretford and Lancashire County Council opposed the merger, which was rejected following a government inquiry. In 1969 Pevsner wrote: \\"That [neighbouring] Stretford and Salford are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England.\\"The tensions between Stretford and the Estates Company began to come to a head in 1906, when in response to complaints in the press about the state of one particular road in the park, Trafford Park Road, Stretford issued formal notices demanding that all premises with frontage onto the road pay for its improvement. Further disputes over the standard of roads in the park followed until, in 1907, the Estates Company presented a petition to Lancashire County Council demanding that Trafford Park should be an urban district in its own right, independent of Stretford.

Choices:  - hydra  - globular  - polypoid  - medusa  A: The answer is:","output":"Most hydrozoa have both polyp and medusa forms in their life cycle. Hydrozoa is a class of relatively simple, mostly marine organisms belonging to the phylum Cnidaria, which also includes more familiar organisms like jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones. Hydrozoans display a characteristic life cycle known as metagenesis, which involves both asexual and sexual reproduction phases. The life cycle can be easily understood by looking at the two distinct body forms, namely polyps and medusae. Polyps are the sessile, or stationary, stage of the life cycle. They are typically cylindrical in shape, with a mouth opening at the top, surrounded by tentacles. Polyps are usually colonial, living in complex colonies called hydranths, which serve different functions such as feeding, reproduction, or defense. They reproduce asexually, primarily through budding - a process where a small outgrowth of the parent polyp detaches and develops into a new individual. Medusae, on the other hand, are the free-swimming, typically bell-shaped stage of the life cycle, generally referred to as the jellyfish stage. In contrast to polyps, medusae reproduce sexually. They possess both male and female reproductive organs (gonads) and release eggs and sperm into the water column. Fertilized eggs then develop into planktonic larvae called planulae, which eventually settle onto a solid substrate, metamorphose into a small polyp, and begin the asexual phase again. Some hydrozoans, like the freshwater Hydra, only exhibit the polyp stage, while others alternate between polyp and medusa forms throughout their life cycle. This alternation between the two forms helps ensure the long-term survival of the species, as it allows hydrozoans to adapt to and exploit a wide variety of environments and ecological niches and enhances dispersal potential. In conclusion, most members of the hydrozoa class exhibit both polyp and medusa forms throughout their life cycles. This distinction serves important functional and reproductive roles and allows these unique organisms to persist in diverse environments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Neutered male cats tend to have less problems with aggression and spraying, which is a sign of being territorial.","output":"Step 1: Observe the cats closely Before intervening, it is essential to watch the cats and understand their triggers, body language, and individual personalities. This knowledge will be useful for addressing their needs and creating a peaceful environment. Step 2: Create separate spaces for the cats Designate separate areas for the cats, complete with their own food and water bowls, beds, and litter boxes. This can help reduce territorial arguments by giving each cat its own space. Step 3: Introduce calming techniques Use calming pheromone diffusers or sprays in the areas where the cats spend most of their time. These products can help relax the cats and lower stress levels. Step 4: Gradual reintroduction Start slowly reintroducing the cats to each other by allowing them to sniff and see each other through a barrier, like a baby gate. This way, they can get used to each other's presence without any physical contact. Step 5: Encourage positive interactions During supervised interactions, use treats, toys, and calming sprays to create a positive association between the cats. Encourage playtime and give rewards to both cats when they display friendly behavior. Step 6: Monitor progress Keep track of any improvement or regression in the cats' relationship. Pay attention to their body language and intervene if signs of aggression appear. It's crucial to be patient and persistent, as the process may take some time. Step 7: Consult a professional If the cats continue to show aggression or hostility towards each other despite consistent efforts, it may be necessary to consult a professional cat behaviorist or veterinarian for further guidance.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the full names of the people who see three ladies washing clothes in a river and singing? ?  In 1937 Mississippi during the Great Depression, three convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete Hogwallop, and Delmar O'Donnell, escape from a chain gang and set out to retrieve a supposed treasure Everett buried, before its locale is flooded to make a lake and provide electricity for the state. The three get a lift from a blind man driving a handcar on a railway. He tells them, among other prophecies, that they will find a fortune but not the one they seek. The trio make their way to the house of Wash, Pete's cousin. They sleep in the barn, but Wash reports them to Sheriff Cooley, who, along with his men, torches the barn. After Pete angrily blows up Cooley's police van, Wash's son helps them escape. Pete and Delmar are baptized by a group of Christians at a river. The group then picks up Tommy Johnson, a young black man, who claims he has sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play the guitar. In need of money, the four stop at a radio broadcast tower where they record a song as The Soggy Bottom Boys. That night, the trio part ways with Tommy after their car is discovered by the police. Unbeknownst to them, the recording becomes a major hit. The trio inadvertently fall in with bank robber George \\"Baby Face\\" Nelson, and help him with a heist, before he leaves them with his share of the loot. The next day, the group hears singing.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Similarity refers to the psychological nearness or proximity of two mental representations . It is one of the principles of grouping in Gestalt psychology According to Daniel Schachter \`\` Regions that are similar in color , lightness , shape , or texture are perceived as belonging to the same object '' Research in cognitive psychology has taken a number of approaches to the concept of similarity . Each of them is related to a particular set of assumptions about knowledge representation .  - Attention is the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether deemed subjective or objective, while ignoring other perceivable information. It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneous objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. Attention has also been referred to as the allocation of limited processing resources.  - Personality psychology is a branch of psychology that studies personality and its variation among individuals. Its areas of focus include:  - Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why human beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan. This field examines change across a broad range of topics including: motor skills, cognitive development, executive functions, moral understanding, language acquisition, social change, personality, emotional development, self-concept and identity formation.  - Perception (from the Latin \\"perceptio, percipio\\") is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the environment. All perception involves signals in the nervous system, which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the sense organs. For example, vision involves light striking the retina of the eye, smell is mediated by odor molecules, and hearing involves pressure waves. Perception is not the passive receipt of these signals, but is shaped by learning, memory, expectation, and attention.  - Mental process or mental function are all the things that individuals can do with their minds. These include perception, memory, thinking (such as ideation, imagination, belief, reasoning, etc.), volition, and emotion. Sometimes the term \\"cognitive function\\" is used instead.  - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.  - Abnormal psychology is the branch of psychology that studies unusual patterns of behavior, emotion and thought, which may or may not be understood as precipitating a mental disorder. Although many behaviours could be considered as abnormal, this branch of psychology generally deals with behavior in a clinical context. There is a long history of attempts to understand and control behavior deemed to be aberrant or deviant (statistically, morally or in some other sense), and there is often cultural variation in the approach taken. The field of abnormal psychology identifies multiple causes for different conditions, employing diverse theories from the general field of psychology and elsewhere, and much still hinges on what exactly is meant by \\"abnormal\\". There has traditionally been a divide between psychological and biological explanations, reflecting a philosophical dualism in regard to the mind body problem. There have also been different approaches in trying to classify mental disorders. Abnormal includes three different categories; they are subnormal, supernormal and paranormal.  - Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes such as \\"attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and thinking.\\" Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into various other modern disciplines of psychological study, including educational psychology, social psychology, personality psychology, abnormal psychology, developmental psychology, and economics.  - Educational Psychology is the branch of psychology concerned with the scientific study of human learning. The study of learning processes, from both cognitive and behavioral perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan.  - Social psychology is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. In this definition, \\"scientific\\" refers to the empirical method of investigation. The terms \\"thoughts\\", \\"feelings\\", and \\"behaviors\\" include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others' presence may be \\"imagined\\" or \\"implied\\" suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms. Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the interaction of mental states and immediate social situations.  - Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes. It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of cognition. Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform information. Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language, perception, memory, attention, reasoning, and emotion; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology. The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization, from learning and decision to logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization. The fundamental concept of cognitive science is that \\"thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures.\\"  - A mental representation (or cognitive representation), in philosophy of mind, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science, is a hypothetical internal cognitive symbol that represents external reality, or else a mental process that makes use of such a symbol: \\"a formal system for making explicit certain entities or types of information, together with a specification of how the system does this.\\"    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'similarity ' exhibits the relationship of 'facet of'. Find the answer from the choices below.  Choices: - cognition  - economics  - human  - learning  - organization  - perception  - process  - psychology  - science  - social psychology  - thought Answer:","output":"Similarity exhibits the relationship of 'facet of' with perception. Perception is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information to represent and understand the environment. Similarity, as a principle of grouping in Gestalt psychology, plays a crucial role in how we perceive and interpret objects or mental representations that are similar in color, lightness, shape, or texture. Research in cognitive psychology expands our understanding of the concept of similarity, which directly impacts our perception of the external world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Across the South, sharecropping evolved, in which landless black and white farmers worked land owned by others in return for a share of the profits. Some farmers rented the land and bore the production costs themselves. Until mechanical cotton pickers were developed, cotton farmers needed additional labor to hand-pick cotton. Picking cotton was a source of income for families across the South. Rural and small town school systems had split vacations so children could work in the fields during \\"cotton-picking.\\" Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What part of the southern population worked as sharecroppers?","output":"Imagine you have a big box of Legos, but you don't have anywhere to build with them.

You both get to enjoy the fun of playing with the Legos and the finished product. This is sort of what sharecropping was like. Some people in the South had land after the big war (the Civil War), but they didn't have enough money or workers to grow their cotton. Others didn't have land but could work. So, they made a deal: the workers would get to live on the land and grow cotton, and when it was time to sell it, they would share the money they made. This way, both sides got something they needed. Now, it's hard to give an exact number like \\"1 out of 5 people\\" who worked as sharecroppers in the South, because it's been a long time and we don't have all the details. But we do know that many people, both black and white, worked as sharecroppers after the war. They helped grow the cotton that was an important part of the Southern economy.

On an island near Antarctica, a male penguin named Peter sees a female named Polly, and attempts to woo her. First he offers her an ice cream made of snow and icicle, which she accepts. Next, he tries catching her a fish, but only succeeds in catching a pufferfish. Polly accepts it graciously, but when she swallows it, she begins inflating and deflating repeatedly until Peter makes her spit out the fish, which then returns to water. Peter shrugs in embarrassment, but, feeling humiliated, Polly slaps him and leaves to swim on a small iceberg. On the shore, Peter kicks himself for letting her get away, but then notices a sharkfin moving towards Polly's iceberg. He squawks a danger warning to her, but Polly ignores him, thinking that he's just begging for forgiveness that he won't get. Soon enough, the shark attacks Polly, who swims away in panic. Needing to act, Peter picks up a stick and charges out to help.  The shark chases Polly around the bay for several minutes. When it looks like he has her cornered, Peter arrives and clobbers him on the nose. Enraged, the shark starts chasing after Peter. After several minutes of fighting and swimming away from the shark, Peter tries to escape by climbing up onto a cliff with a boulder on top. Peter unintentionally dislodges the boulder, which falls into the shark's mouth, who then swallows it. Due to the boulder's weight, the shark sinks to the bottom of the bay.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original","output":"The sentiment of the sentence, \\"that not only fails on its own, but makes you second-guess your affection for the original,\\" can be considered negative. In this detailed analysis, we'll dissect the sentence to understand the negative sentiment. First, let's break down the sentence structure: 1. \\"that not only fails on its own\\" - This part of the sentence clearly shows a sense of failure. The use of \\"not only\\" amplifies the negative sentiment and tells us that there is something more to come. The fact that the subject in question \\"fails on its own\\" implies that it is incapable of succeeding or providing any satisfaction on an individual level. 2. \\"but makes you second-guess your affection for the original\\" - The conjunction \\"but\\" used here indicates a contrast, while \\"makes you second-guess\\" conveys a tone of doubt and disappointment. Furthermore, the term \\"your affection for the original\\" implies that the reader initially had a strong, positive emotional connection to the original item, but now, due to the subject under discussion, their confidence or faith in the original is being shaken. Taking the two parts of the sentence together, we can see that the negative sentiment comes from the incapability of the subject to succeed on its own, as well as the damage it does to one's appreciation of the original. The sentence implies that not only does the subject not meet expectations, it also has an adverse effect on something that was initially liked or appreciated, which effectively amplifies the negative sentiment. Overall, the combination of the two parts creates a sense of disapproval and disappointment, making the sentiment negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway. In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the \\"Avengers Initiative\\". Agent Natasha Romanoff is sent to Calcutta to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract. In Stuttgart, Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract. Answer:","output":"Thor wants Loki to go back to Asgard."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.  A doctor tested two people for HIV. Tom had the virus in his blood, while Nick didn't have HIV, he was healthy. Tom has apparently had the virus for 20 years.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  and the situation: Dan harvested lots of fruit and decided to candy some of them to preserve them. He left some fruit fresh for the family to enjoy. He candied apples, pears, plums, and quince. He didn't candy oranges, blueberries, apricots and peaches.  Answer the following question: Which fruit retained their quality longer, apples or peaches?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which is this about? A new front has been opened in the long-dormant browser war, with an open-source program called Firefox aiming to challenge Microsoft #39;s dominant Internet Explorer.","output":"The statement above refers to the emergence of the Firefox web browser as a new contender in the fiercely competitive browser market. Developed by the Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to furthering open-source projects, Firefox rose to prominence in the mid-2000s as a viable alternative to Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE). The browser war refers to the intense rivalry between companies developing web browsers, each vying for the largest market share possible. Mozilla Firefox, first released in 2002 as a development project called Phoenix, was developed with the intention to create a lightweight and fast web browser built on the Gecko engine. The primary goal was to offer a more secure and user-friendly alternative to Internet Explorer, which, at that time, faced numerous security issues and criticism for its lack of standards compliance. This new front in the browser war was significant for several reasons: 1. **Increased choice for consumers:** The arrival of Firefox as a viable alternative meant that users had a choice between browsers, with each offering distinct features, interface designs, and customization options. This resulted in a more diverse and competitive browser market, leading to faster innovation and improvement of browser technologies. 2. **Challenging Microsoft's dominance:** At the height of its popularity, Internet Explorer held more than 90% of the market share, severely limiting competition and stifling innovation. Firefox played a crucial role in reducing this monopoly, paving the way for other browser alternatives like Google Chrome, Apple's Safari, and Opera to enter the market. 3. **Promoting open-source development:** Firefox's success demonstrated the strengths of open-source development. By encouraging collaboration amongst developers around the world, Firefox was able to secure a substantial share of the market, as well as support from other major players such as Google, which saw the value in backing the open-source project. 4. **Security and privacy improvements:** With its focus on providing a more secure browsing experience, Firefox introduced important security features such as the popup blocker and anti-phishing protection. Its commitment to user privacy also set an important precedent, with features like private browsing mode and the development of various privacy-focused browser extensions. 5. **Greater emphasis on standards compliance:** Firefox's commitment to adhering to web standards played an important role in improving the overall Web experience for users. By promoting the use of modern web technologies, it pushed Microsoft to improve its own standards support in subsequent versions of Internet Explorer, fostering a more uniform and consistent browsing experience across different browsers. Ultimately, the opening of this new front in the browser war marked a significant shift in the landscape of the market. The emergence and subsequent success of Firefox challenged Microsoft's dominance and changed the browser industry fundamentally by encouraging innovation, competition, and a greater focus on security, privacy, and standards compliance. This shift has continued to impact the browser market and has contributed to the development of the thriving, innovative ecosystem of web technologies that we see today."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Bodmin is a civil parish and major town in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is situated south-west of Bodmin Moor.  - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around  43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century.  - A conurbation is a region comprising a number of cities, large towns, and other urban areas that, through population growth and physical expansion, have merged to form one continuous urban or industrially developed area. In most cases, a conurbation is a polycentric urbanised area, in which transportation has developed to link areas to create a single urban labour market or travel to work area.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan.  - Truro is a city and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. Truro is Cornwall's county town and only city, its centre for administration, leisure and retail and had a population recorded in the 2011 census of 18,766. It is the most southern city in mainland Great Britain. People from Truro are known as Truronians.   - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million.  - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region.  - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.  - Camborne ('Crooked Hill') is a town and civil parish in west Cornwall, UK. It is at the western edge of a conurbation comprising Camborne, Pool and Redruth.  - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.  - Cornwall is a ceremonial county and unitary authority area of England within the United Kingdom. It is bordered to the north and west by the Celtic Sea, to the south by the English Channel, and to the east by the county of Devon, over the River Tamar. Cornwall has a population of and covers an area of . The administrative centre, and only city in Cornwall, is Truro, although the town of Falmouth has the largest population for a civil parish and the conurbation of Camborne, Pool and Redruth has the highest total population.  - Bodmin Moor is a granite moorland in northeastern Cornwall, England. It is in size, and dates from the Carboniferous period of geological history. It includes Brown Willy, the highest point in Cornwall, and Rough Tor, a slightly lower peak. Many of Cornwall's rivers have their sources here. It has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic era, when primitive farmers started clearing trees and farming the land. They left their megalithic monuments, hut circles and cairns, and the Bronze Age culture that followed left further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows. By medieval and modern times, nearly all the forest was gone and livestock rearing predominated.  - The Tamar is a river in south west England, that forms most of the border between Devon (to the east) and Cornwall (to the west). The area is a World Heritage Site due to its historic mining activities.  - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster).   - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor.  - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - A watchmaker is an artisan who makes and repairs watches. Since a majority of watches are now factory made, most modern watchmakers only repair watches. However, originally they were master craftsmen who built watches, including all their parts, by hand. Modern watchmakers, when required to repair older watches, for which replacement parts may not be available, must have fabrication skills, and can typically manufacture replacements for many of the parts found in a watch. The term clockmaker refers to an equivalent occupation specializing in clocks.  - John Arnold ( born 1736 probably in Bodmin , Cornwall -- died 1799 in London ) was an English watchmaker and inventor . John Arnold was the first to design a watch that was both practical and accurate , and also brought the term \`\` Chronometer '' into use in its modern sense , meaning a precision timekeeper . His technical advances enabled the quantity production of Marine Chronometers for use on board ships from around 1782 . The basic design of these , with a few modifications unchanged until the late twentieth century . With regard to his legacy one can say that both he and Abraham - Louis Breguet largely invented the modern mechanical watch . Certainly one of his most important inventions , the Overcoil balance spring is still to be found in most mechanical wrist watches to this day . It is necessary to point out that the brand name Arnold & Son used by a Swiss watch company has absolutely no connection to the original firm founded by John Arnold . It was from around 1770 that Arnold developed the portable precision timekeeper , almost from the point where John Harrison ended his work in this field . But compared to Harrison 's complicated and expensive watch , Arnold 's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable . Importantly , the relatively simple and conventional design of his movement facilitated its production in quantity at a reasonable price whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment . But three elements were necessary for this achievement : A detached escapement , which gave minimal interference with the vibrating balance and balance spring A balance design that enabled compensation for the effect of temperature on the balance spring A method for adjusting the balance spring , so that the balance oscillates in equal time periods , even through different degrees of balance arc  - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire.  - A clockmaker is an artisan who makes and/or repairs clocks. Since almost all clocks are now factory-made, most modern clockmakers only repair clocks. Modern clockmakers may be employed by jewellers, antique shops, and places devoted strictly to repairing clocks and watches. Clockmakers must be able to read blueprints and instructions for numerous types of clocks and time pieces that vary from antique clocks to modern time pieces in order to fix and make clocks or watches. The trade requires fine motor coordination as clockmakers must frequently work on devices with small gears and fine machinery.  - Redruth is a town and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The population of Redruth was 14,018 at the 2011 census. In the same year the population of the Camborne-Redruth urban area, which also includes Carn Brea, Illogan and several satellite villages, stood at 55,400 making it the largest conurbation in Cornwall. Redruth lies approximately at the junction of the A393 and A3047 roads, on the route of the old London to Land's End trunk road (now the A30), and is approximately west of Truro, east of St Ives, north east of Penzance and north west of Falmouth. Camborne and Redruth together form the largest urban area in Cornwall and before local government reorganisation were an urban district.  - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone.   - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.

Article: Every year on my birthday, from the time I turned 12, a white gardenia was delivered to my house. No card came with it. Calls to the flower-shop were not helpful at all. After a while I stopped trying to discover the sender's name and just delighted in the beautiful white flower in soft pink paper. But I never stopped imagining who the giver might be. Some of my happiest moments were spent daydreaming about the sender. My mother encouraged these imaginings. She'd ask me if there was someone for whom I had done special kindness. Perhaps it was the old man across the street whose mail I'd delivered during the winter. As a girl, though, I had more fun imagining that it might be a boy I had run into. One month before my graduation, my father died. I felt so sad that I became completely uninterested in my upcoming graduation dance, and I didn't care if I had a new dress or not. But my mother, in her own sadness, would not let me miss any of those things. She wanted her children to feel loved and lovable. In truth, my mother wanted her children to see themselves much like the gardenia-lovely, strong and perfect with perhaps a bit of mystery .My mother died ten days after I was married. I was 22.

No, Queen Elizabeth II does not have the final veto on the UK leaving the EU. While the Queen is the ceremonial head of the country and has some powers, important decisions like this are made by the government and Parliament. They followed a process called Brexit, which was the UK leaving the EU, and it has already happened without the Queen having to make the final decision. 3. No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. A paraphrase means the same information or question is expressed in different words but means the same thing.

You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Never got it Product review: I never received this item! I had to rate this so I gave it a 1 star, but it wasn't worth that. A:","output":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product, but it should be observed with caution and analyzed in different aspects. Here are some reasons why the review might affect my decision: 1. Delivery Issues: If a customer claims that they never received the item, it might indicate that there are some issues with the delivery process. If there are more similar reviews about delivery problems, this would be a red flag, and I would be less likely to buy the product. However, if this is the only such review, it might be an isolated or rare case. 2. Perception of Overall Ratings: Due to the 1-star rating from this review, the overall rating of the product might get affected, especially if there are not many reviews. This might subconsciously make me lean towards not buying the product, as people generally rely on the average rating of a product while shopping online to make quick decisions. 3. Review Relevance: While analyzing reviews, one important aspect is to consider the relevance of the review to the actual performance or quality of the product. This particular review does not offer any useful information about the product itself - it only discusses the delivery issue which might not even be the fault of the product or the seller. As a result, it would be wise to look for other reviews that discuss the actual performance, quality, and usefulness of the product in question. 4. Seller Reputation: The review might make me question the seller's reputation and their ability to fulfill orders. If there are numerous complaints about the delivery and order fulfillment, it might indicate that the seller is not trustworthy, which would decrease my chances of purchasing the product. 5. Unfair Ratings: It is important to recognize that sometimes customers may give 1-star ratings for issues that may not be directly related to the product itself or its performance. Such reviews might not be a true representation of the product quality, so it is essential to look beyond the rating and reach a more comprehensive understanding of the product through other reviews. In conclusion, while this particular review could initially decrease my chances of purchasing the product, it is necessary to use critical thinking skills while evaluating the reviews on any product. A single review might not provide enough information or an accurate depiction of the product's quality; it is crucial to look at various reviews and feedback to make a well-informed decision. However, if there are multiple reviews indicating delivery issues or poor seller reputation, this would certainly affect my decision to buy the product negatively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Especially he is interested in treating children. One day he saw two children, child M and child N, and found child M is infected with Acute Hepatitis B while child N is infected with Chronic Hepatitis B. Next day he saw two other children, child O and child P. Child O was younger, but child P was older.  But I can use this background: Hepatitis B is a contagious virus that affects the liver, infection can last from a few weeks to a serious lifelong illness. Two different types of infection exist for this disease, \\"acute\\" and \\"chronic.\\" Acute Hepatitis B is a short term illness that occurs within 6 months of exposure, Chronic Hepatitis B is long term and happens when the virus remains in the body. The younger the child is, the greater their chance of developing a chronic infection and this risk goes down as the child gets older. Approximately 90% of infected infants will develop a chronic infection.[3]  What is an answer for this question: Which child had less chance of developing a chronic infection, child O or child P? The answer is:","output":"Child P had less chance of developing a chronic infection. From the background information provided, we know that the risk of developing a chronic Hepatitis B infection decreases as the child gets older. Since Child O is younger than Child P, it implies that Child O naturally has a higher risk of developing a chronic infection than Child P.  The statistics mentioned indicate that approximately 90% of infected infants will develop a chronic infection. Although we don't have the specific ages of Child O and Child P, we can infer that as children get older, their chances of developing a chronic infection will be lower than younger children, thus making Child P less likely to develop a chronic infection as compared to Child O. Additionally, it's crucial to understand the difference between acute and chronic Hepatitis B infections. In the initial situation described, Child M is infected with Acute Hepatitis B, while Child N is infected with Chronic Hepatitis B. The acute infection is typically short-term, happening within the first six months after exposure to the virus. In contrast, a chronic infection persists as the virus remains in the body, leading to long-term health issues. In conclusion, based on the age factor and the background information about Hepatitis B infections, Child P, being the older child, has a lower risk of developing a chronic infection in comparison to Child_O."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Build a movie plot around this: who gather together for a birthday party which turns into a philosophical argument? Snaut, Chris, Sartorius, and Hari Answer:","output":"Title: The Birthday Paradox Step 1: Setting the stage The movie takes place in present-day New York City. All four friends, Snaut, Chris, Sartorius, and Hari, live in the city and are professionals working in different fields. They frequently engage in philosophy-based book club meetings and enjoy discussing different theories, personal beliefs, and contemplations. Step 2: The birthday party Hari, a college professor in philosophy, has invited his closest friends, Snaut, Chris, and Sartorius, to his 40th birthday party. Snaut is a theoretical physicist, Chris is a renowned writer, and Sartorius is a molecular biologist. They all gather at Hari's spacious loft, where the party takes place, filled with fine food, drinks, and music. Step 3: The initial conflict As the night progresses, Chris brings up a controversial topic in philosophy and science: the simulation hypothesis, which argues that our reality is potentially an artificial simulation. Hari, the birthday man himself, expresses his doubts about the theory, while Snaut and Sartorius seem to be more open to the idea, focusing on their respective scientific fields to back up the hypothesis. Step 4: The intensification of the argument The discussion begins to heat up as the characters start presenting their perspectives, supporting or rejecting the simulation hypothesis. As they debate, they touch on consciousness, free will, religion, and morality, ultimately coming forth with their own divergent philosophical views:  - Snaut argues from a physics perspective, discussing the quantum realm and its implications about the nature of reality.  - Chris analyzes the human experience and emotions through the eyes of a writer. He raises the idea of existentialism, highlighting human's search for meaning in life. - Sartorius reflects on advancements in genetic engineering and artificial intelligence that challenge traditional beliefs about the limits of science and humanity.  - Hari counters with critical thinking, skepticism, and the limitations of human understanding. Step 5: Culmination and self-reflection As the philosophical argument reaches its climax, the four friends suddenly find themselves put to the test when a mysterious figure, who has been silently observing their conversation, joins the debate. This fifth person provides a unique and thought-provoking perspective that forces them to question not only the validity of their arguments but also confront their personal beliefs and fears surrounding life, love, and existence. Step 6: Resolution and ending Realizing that their search for an ultimate truth might be an endless endeavor, the friends learn that what truly matters is the freedom to explore, question, and grow together. They embrace their differences and appreciate the value of their friendship beyond the boundaries of any theory or belief. In the end, they raise a toast to Hari's birthday and acknowledge that life's paradoxes make it all the more worth living."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is an article: The fate of a 16-year-old Connecticut girl at the center of a major medical custody dispute is in the hands of a Massachusetts judge, now that Bay State children's advocates have conceded Justina Pelletier should be returned to her family. In a controversial move, Pelletier was placed in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families more than a year ago, after two reputable Boston hospitals sparred in their diagnosis of the girl. When the girl's parents disagreed with a psychiatric diagnosis given by Boston Children's Hospital, the couple said they wanted their daughter returned to her original physician at Tufts Medical Center, who had previously treated Justina for mitochondrial disease, a group of rare genetic disorders affecting cellular energy production. Lou and Linda Pelletier, of West Hartford, Conn., were then accused of \\"medical child abuse,\\" which led to Massachusetts officials taking full custody of the girl. The legal battle that ensued made the case one of the most controversial custody battles in state history. In May, Justina was moved from Massachusetts to a facility in Thompson, Conn. Her parents are now able to visit with their daughter, but still angry that she hasn't been returned home. In a 45-second, videotaped plea, first posted on a Facebook support page Sunday night, Justina is seen sitting in a chair and pleading plaintively with Massachusetts juvenile court Judge Joseph Johnston. \\"All I really want is to be with my family and friends,\\" the girl says, her voice faltering at times. \\"You can do it. You're the one that's judging this. Please let me go home.\\" In what Justina's attorneys are calling a \\"dramatic reversal,\\" the Massachusetts DCF filed a motion agreeing that the teenager should be returned to her family. Alec Loftus, a spokesman for Massachusetts Health and Human Services Secretary John Polanowicz, confirmed to FoxNews.com Wednesday that both parties are in agreement. \\"We are pleased that the family has engaged around the reunification plan and we have filed papers in court to support our shared goal of bringing Justina home,\\" he said in an email. Attorneys representing Justina filed a subsequent motion Tuesday requesting that Johnston expedite a ruling \\"because all parties are in agreement,\\" said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, which represents the Pelletier family. According to sources close to the case, Johnston issued a June 13 deadline for all paperwork to be filed and indicated a ruling will be made on or before June 20. Staver claims that DCF's concession \\"completely undercuts their argument.\\" \\"She's now getting treatment from Tuft’s medical providers and they’ve agreed to return her to her family,\\" Staver told FoxNews.com. \\"This really cuts out the basis for why they took her in the first place.\\" \\"We're waiting on the judge. At this point, there is no reason to delay,\\" he said. \\"There’s no reason why he can't act immediately.\\" The emotional toll on Justina and her family is one that cannot be measured, Staver said. \\"Every hour she's not back with her family is an hour she can't ever get back,\\" he said. \\"Once she does get home, she’ll have a long road to recovery -- physically, mentally and spiritually.\\" Justina has missed out on two years of education, Staver said, and went from becoming a competitive figure skater to being confined in a wheelchair. Lou Pelletier, meanwhile, said he remains skeptical of the judge, after so many legal hurdles, and will \\"jump for joy once she is released home.\\" \\"Actions speak louder than words,\\" Pelletier said.

Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Answer choices: - direct energy  - the egg timer  - Fuel cells  - the spatula  - the fridge  - oysters  - the stove  - electricity The answer is:","output":"The correct answer is \\"the stove\\" and \\"electricity.\\"  Eggs can indeed be cooked on a stove, as the stove provides the heat necessary to cook them. A gas or electric stove can be used, with the heat being transferred from the burner to the pan containing the eggs. Therefore, the stove is one of the correct answers. Electricity is another correct answer. For electric stoves, it is the electricity that powers the heating elements, allowing the transfer of heat to the pan for cooking the eggs. Additionally, eggs can also be cooked using electric appliances such as electric griddles, skillets, or even microwave ovens, all of which rely on electricity as their energy source. As for the other options: - Direct energy: This is not applicable, as it's not a specific source or method for cooking eggs. - The egg timer: This is simply a tool to help track cooking time and ensure the eggs are cooked as desired but does not cook the eggs directly. - Fuel cells: These convert chemical energy into electrical energy, but they are not used for cooking eggs. - The spatula: While it's a handy tool used in flipping, stirring, or serving the eggs, it does not cook them. - The fridge: This is an appliance for storing and preserving food at a low temperature, not for cooking. - Oysters: These are a type of shellfish and not relevant to cooking eggs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: For the first time, scientists have found a planet beyond the solar system that not only is the same size as Earth, but has the same proportions of iron and rock, a key step in an ongoing quest to find potentially habitable sister worlds.     The planet, known as Kepler-78b, circles a star that is slightly smaller than the sun located in the constellation Cygnus , about 400 light years away.     Kepler-78b was discovered last year with NASA's now-idled Kepler space telescope, which detected potential planets as they circled in front of their parent stars, blocking a bit of light. That measurement not only revealed that Kepler-78b was  ly small, with a diameter just 20 percent larger than Earth's, but that it was practically orbiting on the surface of its host star. Scientists do not know how the planets ended up so close to their host stars.  While the planet's presumably molten surface and hot temperatures make it ill-suited for life, two independent teams of astronomers jumped at the opportunity to follow up the discovery with ground-based measurements to try to determine the density of Kepler-78b. In two papers in this week's journal Nature, the teams report that not only were they successful, but that they came to the same conclusion: Kepler-78b has roughly the same density as Earth, suggesting that it also is made primarily of rock and iron. Kepler-78b is among a dozen or so recently discovered small planets that orbit very close to their parent stars. Kepler-78b, for example, completes an orbit in just 8.5 hours. Question: The word \\" density\\" in the text suggests a measurement of the planet's   _  . - volume - size - weight - thickness A:","output":"The word \\"density\\" in the text suggests a measurement of the planet's weight.

The answer is yes. The process of speciation within the same space is called sympatric speciation; the prefix “sym” means same, so “sympatric” means “same homeland” in contrast to “allopatric” meaning “other homeland. ” A number of mechanisms for sympatric speciation have been proposed and studied. One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. In a normal cell division event chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes. However, sometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few individual chromosomes in a condition called aneuploidy (Figure 18.14).

A:","output":"Title: \\"Whispers of Freedom\\" Genre: Psychological Thriller Plot: Act 1: Miles, a successful architect in his early 30s, lives with his wife Sandra in a beautiful suburban neighborhood. They appear to have the perfect marriage on the surface, but internally there is an undercurrent of fear and suspicion. This can mainly be attributed to Miles' manipulative and controlling nature. Sandra, a talented painter, loses her sense of self and feels trapped within the confines of her marriage to Miles. One fateful day, Sandra discovers hidden evidence that Miles has been cheating on her with their neighbor, Lucy. Shocked and hurt, Sandra realizes she can no longer live a life of deceit and isolation. Act 2: Sandra's plan to regain control over her life begins when her best friend Eliza comes to visit for the weekend. During a therapeutic painting session, Sandra lets her guard down and reveals the truth about her crumbling relationship. Eliza, the epitome of loyalty and courage, convinces Sandra to stand up to Miles and leave him once and for all. As Sandra packs her bags, determined to take back her life, Miles returns home earlier than expected. Sensing something amiss, he confronts Sandra who tells him she is leaving. Miles, unwilling to lose control and unveil his infidelity, resorts to desperate measures. As Sandra tries to leave, he locks the door and pockets the keys, effectively trapping her inside their home. Act 3: With her safety at risk, Sandra and Eliza devise an escape plan. Using their artistic and creative skills, they manage to create multiple copies of the key to the house using clay and other materials at their disposal. They outsmart Miles by switching out these fake keys as he leaves for his job the following day. Miles grows increasingly paranoid and convinced that he is on the verge of losing everything, which fuels his anger and determination to keep Sandra locked up. His behavior becomes more erratic, showcasing his true nature despite his best effort to keep up appearances. Meanwhile, Sandra and Eliza work on unearthing evidence of his adulterous and manipulative behavior that would make their neighbors and friends realize his true nature, including Lucy, who is regretful of her actions and now feels pity for Sandra. Act 4: As Miles continues to spiral out of control, Sandra and Eliza manage to complete their plan against him. They call the police and present the evidence they've collected against Miles. Grappling with undeniable proof, the police arrest Miles, who is charged with domestic abuse and infidelity-related offenses. Feeling betrayed and exposed, Miles' life takes a drastic turn as he loses everything that once gave him a sense of power and control. Meanwhile, Sandra, now a free and stronger woman, decides to use her experience as inspiration for her art. By sharing her story, she inspires others who have been trapped in similar situations to break free from their own chains. The movie ends with a bittersweet victory: Sandra hosting her first solo art exhibition featuring paintings that illustrates her physical and emotional journey toward freedom.

Tweet: i wish i had my phone back!!!!  - negative. - positive.","output":"To accurately determine the sentiment of the given tweet, it is necessary to analyze the content and context of the message. The tweet states, \\"i wish i had my phone back!\\" followed by multiple exclamation marks. From the text, we can derive that the speaker has experienced a loss (their phone) and is expressing a desire to regain the lost item. However, there is no clear indication of whether the sentiment is positive or negative solely based on this text. It could be interpreted in the following ways: 1. Negative: The tweet might be seen as negative in the sense that the speaker is upset or annoyed about not having their phone. They might feel disconnected from their contacts, social media, and other essential aspects of their life, creating a sense of frustration and sadness. 2. Positive: Alternatively, the tweet can be seen as positive if the emphasis is placed on the exclamation marks, which may suggest enthusiasm or excitement about the possibility of recovering their phone. In this interpretation, the speaker is eager to get their phone back and might feel a sense of relief or optimism about this event taking place. However, without any additional context, it is challenging to definitively classify the sentiment of the tweet as either negative or positive. Analyzing the context and any other relevant information can help better understand the emotional tone behind this tweet, such as emojis used or the events that transpired before this tweet.

He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird.

Premise: \\"All you need to do is just wander off the beaten path, beyond the bustling tourist zone.\\"  This statement suggests that a person might gain some valuable experience or find hidden gems in life by exploring areas that are not frequently visited by tourists. The emphasis is on going beyond the typical tourist spots and discovering new things. The underlying assumption is that there is value in exploring less popular or less well-known destinations. Hypothesis: \\"There is no point going off the beaten path, there is nothing there.\\" This statement proposes that there is no value or interest in exploring areas beyond the popular tourist zones. It implies that areas that are not considered tourist hotspots have nothing to offer, suggesting that they are devoid of meaningful experiences for travelers. This contradicts the premise, which said there might be some value in exploring lesser-known places. In order to conclude whether the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The premise implies a potential positive outcome from going off the beaten path, while the hypothesis assumes no benefit at all from doing so. These two statements cannot both be true simultaneously, as they contradict each other.  Thus, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. They have opposing implications, and accepting the premise as true would actually suggest that the hypothesis is false. The premise implies that there might be value in exploring less popular areas and deviating from the traditional tourist pathways, while the hypothesis suggests that there is nothing to gain from such exploration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the...  answer the following question:  What nurtures frogs, lizards and various insects?

McClane and Carver escape and return to headquarters, where Simon calls again and threatens to detonate more bombs if McClane and Carver do not follow his instructions. Simon sends the two on a series of children's riddles. He tells them to reach Wall Street station 90 blocks south, within 30 minutes to stop a bomb planted on a Brooklyn-bound 3 train. McClane boards the subway while Carver drives. McClane locates the bomb and throws it off the train, it still detonates, derailing the train and sending it through the station with minimal injuries due to Carver's warnings. As McClane and Carver regroup with the police, they are met by FBI agents, who reveal Simon is Peter Krieg, a former Colonel in the East German People's Army and a mercenary-for-hire. Krieg is after McClane as Krieg's birth name is Simon Peter Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber whom McClane had previously killed in Nakatomi Towers. Simon calls the police, knowing the FBI is there, that he has planted a bomb in a public school and rigged with a radio detonator triggered by the police band. Simon tells them that he will get McClane and Carver the school's location if they continue to play his game. While McClane and Carver set off on Simon's next task, the police organize all the city's public works to begin searching schools, using 9-1-1 to coordinate activities.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which ocean experiences less cooling of hot molten rock? The answer is:","output":"The Arctic Ocean. Step 1: Understand the problem The premise of the question is that two different oceans have different numbers of divergent plate boundaries.  Step 2: Interpret the data The Arctic Ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, suggesting there is less tectonic activity, while the Pacific Ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates, indicating a lot more tectonic activity. Step 3: Apply knowledge of divergent boundaries At divergent boundaries, tectonic plates move apart from each other. As the plates separate, molten rock (magma) rises from the mantle beneath to fill the gap. This process cools the magma as it comes into contact with the sea water, forming new crust which is usually basalt, a type of rock. Step 4: Make a connection Since more divergent boundaries mean more magma is cooled to form new crust, the Pacific Ocean, with its seven diverging tectonic plates, would experience more cooling of hot molten rock.

If you answer yes to the following questions, you may need counseling:  Do you feel as though your partner consistently takes you for granted? Do you feel as though you are often or consistently neglected or ignored by your partner? Does your partner make you feel angry or annoyed on a daily basis? Do you feel jealous of your partner's friends or career? Do you feel sad, hopeless, or \\"stuck\\" in your marriage? Trust is essential for a relationship to succeed. If you and your spouse cannot trust each other, it is time for you to get professional help. Some signs of trust issues include:  Monitoring the phone calls, text messages, emails, and social media of your partner. Refusing to allow each other to go out or socialize with friends. Accusing each other of cheating without adequate evidence. Keeping secrets from each other. All couples may go through periods of reduced sexual activity, but these should be temporary. If you or your partner has lost interest in sex for a prolonged period of time, seek advice from a counselor.  Try to keep track of how often you have had sex in the last 2-3 months. While every couple's expectation is different, ask yourself if you're satisfied with this pattern. If not, seek counseling. Alternatively, if your spouse seems dissatisfied with your sex life, don't ignore their complaints. Even if you're happy with it, you should address their concerns.

Q: Background A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were successively reported in Wuhan, China. We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ≤1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. Findings 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled.

Electric current is actually the flow of electrons. You may recall, an electron is the outer-most particle in an atom. They have a negative charge. Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction. Direct current is what is used in devices like flashlights. Alternating current (AC) flows in two directions. This is the type of current that flows into your home through wires.

Spend time in bed and do only as much as you feel up to doing during these first few days. Pushing yourself too early may be detrimental to your recovery.  Avoid any heavy lifting or rigorous exercise during this time. Ask your doctor how long you should rest right after your surgery. This will vary depending on the type of procedure. As a general rule, it is important to get your body moving as much as possible once you start recovering from surgery. Movement will encourage blood flow and strengthen your muscles, making it easier for your body to heal. Ask your doctor how much you are allowed to exercise while you recover and what activities you should avoid.  Moderate walking is usually the best exercise to begin with while you are healing. If you spend time recovering in a hospital, asking a nurse or orderly for help walking if necessary. If you are not yet steady on your feet, you may benefit from using a walker or cane to help you keep your balance. High-impact sports, heavy lifting, and rigorous exercise can all cause strain to your body that may delay your healing after surgery. Listen to your doctor's instructions about recovery time and restricted activities. Depending on the surgery you have, you may have to avoid strenuous activity for several weeks or months until your body is fully healed. With major surgeries, your doctor will generally provide you with a specific diet to follow after your operation. Follow any directions or meal plans your doctor gives you very closely while you heal. Eating foods or ingredients that irritate your stomach or cause swelling may hinder your recovery.   Processed foods are likely to cause inflammation and stomach irritation. Foods like fatty fish, walnuts, almonds, flax seeds, leafy green vegetables, and turmeric can help reduce inflammation in your body. Many post-surgery diets are high in fiber to prevent constipation, which can cause you to strain and in turn hurt the site of your surgical wound.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"It appears that there might have been a mix-up in the question, as it appears to be unrelated to the digestive system process mentioned. I believe you meant to ask about volcanic activity and potential effects on the ecosystem, or perhaps the effect of perturbations to the digestive process. Assuming the question is about the effect of more volcanic activity on the organisms and their digestive processes, the answer would be as follows: More magma explosions or volcanic eruptions can have both direct and indirect effects on the digestion process of organisms living in the affected area. The impact of these explosions can be described by more, less, or no effect, depending on the specific factors involved. 1. More effect: Volcanic eruptions releasing large amounts of ash can drastically impact the food sources and environment, which in turn will affect the digestive processes of organisms in that area. For example, the ash can contaminate food sources or lower their availability, forcing organisms to adapt their feeding patterns, which can lead to changes in how the digestive system functions.  2. Less effect: In some cases, the volcanic activity might have a minimal effect on the digestive process. For instance, if the explosion isn't severe enough to significantly harm the ecosystem, species might continue their regular feeding habits, and their digestion will be less affected. 3. No effect: For organisms that are not directly impacted by the volcanic activity, or if the eruption doesn't have significant effects on the ecosystem, their digestion process would remain unchanged. For the second part of your question, regarding the supposed perturbation and its influence on the second effect mentioned: I am assuming that the \\"supposed perturbation\\" refers to an increase in volcanic activity and the second effect mentioned is the tongue's involvement in the digestive process.  In this case, an increase in volcanic activity may have indirect effects on the tongue's role in digestion. For instance, a decrease in food availability could result in organisms consuming different types of food or altering their feeding patterns. Subsequently, the tongue might have to adapt to these new conditions, such as breaking down different textures, pushing food around to aid in digestion, or even adapting to new flavors. The direct influence of volcanic activity on the tongue's role in the digestive process can be seen as less or more effect depending on the severity of the ecosystem changes and the adaptability of the organisms involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title:  BANJA LUKA, Bosnia (Reuters) -  Bosnian Serb Prime Minister  Dragan Mikerevic stepped down on Friday after top peace  overseer Paddy Ashdown fired nine officials to punish Bosnia's  Serb Republic for failing to arrest war crimes suspects.","output":"Title: \\"Resignation of Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Amidst War Crimes Pressure: The Impact of Paddy Ashdown's Decision on Bosnia's Serb Republic and the Pursuit for Justice\\" Introduction: The resignation of Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic on Friday marks a pivotal turning point in the volatile history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The decision came after top peace overseer Paddy Ashdown fired nine officials to punish Bosnia's Serb Republic for their failure to arrest war crimes suspects. This move highlights the complex and delicate balance between reconciliation and accountability in the aftermath of the heinous crimes committed during the Bosnian War. This article will delve into the details surrounding Mikerevic's resignation, the reasons behind Ashdown's decision, and the implications that these events may have on the future of Bosnia's Serb Republic and the ongoing efforts to bring justice to the victims of the war. Background: The brutal conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina lasted from 1992 to 1995, involving ethnic cleansing, genocide, and war crimes, which claimed the lives of an estimated 100,000 people and displaced over two million others. The Dayton Agreement in 1995 ended the war, but its aftermath continues to influence the political climate of the region. At the core of this situation lies the responsibility to bring the perpetrators of war crimes to justice, while also fostering reconciliation among the different ethnic groups that had been involved in the conflict. Mikerevic's Resignation and Ashdown's Actions: Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic's decision to step down came as a response to Paddy Ashdown's move to fire nine officials from Bosnia's Serb Republic for failing to arrest war crimes suspects. A prominent figure in Bosnian politics, Mikerevic's resignation demonstrates a clear discontent with the international community's involvement in holding Bosnian institutions accountable for their role in the war. On the other hand, Ashdown's actions underscore the importance of bringing war criminals to justice and exhibit the determination of the international community to not let war crimes go unpunished. Implications for Bosnia's Serb Republic: Mikerevic's resignation and Ashdown's move may lead to a re-assessment of the responsibilities held by Bosnia's Serb Republic in upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice for the victims of war crimes. These events may pressure the region to cooperate more closely with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and other international institutions in the investigation and prosecution of war criminals. The Pursuit for Justice: The resignation of Dragan Mikerevic and the dismissal of nine officials demonstrate a pressing need for all entities within Bosnia and Herzegovina to be held accountable for past war crimes. Bringing war criminals to justice will not only serve to honor the memory of the victims but also contribute to a healing process for a nation plagued by its devastating past. This, in turn, may facilitate the much-needed reconciliation among different ethnic groups in the region. Conclusion: As shocking and impactful as the resignation of Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic may be, it is essential to consider the broader context of promoting justice and reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. While the extent and consequences of Paddy Ashdown's decision to fire nine officials remain uncertain, it is undeniable that these recent events have re-ignited the conversation surrounding accountability and justice for war crimes committed during the Bosnian War. Looking forward, it is crucial that Bosnia's Serb Republic, along with other entities involved in the conflict, take the necessary steps towards achieving a meaningful and long-lasting peace in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Generate a question about the following movie plot: It is winter in Teheran. Lateef is 17. He works at a building construction site managed by MEMAR, the site foreman. Lateef's job is to serve tea and prepare food for the workers with whom he is always quarrelling. The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds. From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat. While Rahmat does not express herself verbally at all, over time she seems to respond to this love. During a surprise visit of the labour inspectors, they find themselves face to face with Rahmat. She panics and runs away, as they chase her through the city streets. Lateef runs after them, struggling with the inspectors while Rahmat flees. Lateef is beaten and taken to the police station. Now Memar must pay a fine, comply with the law, and lay off all illegal Afghan workers. Lateef can't bear Rahmat's absence, and decides to locate Soltan to get some news of her. He goes to the village where the Afghans live, walks around, meets an enigmatic cobbler, and ends up in the courtyard of a shrine near a graveyard... Answer:","output":"In the movie plot set in winter in Teheran, how does Lateef's relationship with Rahmat change after discovering that Rahmat is actually a girl, and how does this revelation impact Lateef's actions and decisions throughout the story?"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this \\"Choose a board size. Make sure the board is made for your weight. Choose the right board width for your feet. Check out the base material to know how fast a snowboard is.\\" Article:","output":"Title: How to Choose the Perfect Snowboard for You Hey kids! Do you want to have lots of fun in the snow? Snowboarding is an awesome way to spend time outside during winter! But first, we need to find the perfect snowboard just for you. Here is a super easy guide to help you choose the best snowboard! 1. Choose a Board Size The first thing you need to do is pick the right size for your snowboard. Just like how you have different sizes of shoes and clothes, snowboards come in different sizes too. A snowboard should be a good fit for you based on your weight, so it can carry you safely on the snow. If you get a snowboard that’s too small or too big for you, it might be difficult to control and not as much fun. 2. Choose the Right Board Width for Your Feet Next, we need to make sure the snowboard is just the right width for your feet. You don't want your toes hanging off the side when you're standing on it because that can make it tricky to balance and ride. Pick a snowboard that's wide enough to keep your toes and heels comfy, but not too wide that it feels like you're riding on a big, clunky sled. Your mommy or daddy, or a grown-up at the store, can help you find the perfect snowboard width for your feet. 3. Check Out the Base Material to Know How Fast a Snowboard is Lastly, let's look at what the bottom of the snowboard is made of. This is important because it can tell us how fast the snowboard can go on the snow. Some snowboards have a really smooth bottom, kind of like ice, which will make them super fast. Other snowboards have a more textured bottom, which can give you more control, but might be a little slower. Think about how fast you want to go and what you feel most comfortable with when choosing your snowboard's base material. That's it! Now you know how to choose the perfect snowboard for you. Remember, it's always more fun and safe to ride with friends or family, so make sure to bring them along. Put on your warm clothes and safety gear, and get ready to slide, jump, and laugh in the snow. Happy snowboarding!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.  and the situation: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest.

Kate and Ollie have been together since high school. Kate finds out she is pregnant, which complicates the whole situation because she is not sure if she truly does want to breakup with Ollie or not. However, Kate does not want to have a baby, but does not want to wait weeks for a clinical abortion, so her herbalist friend, Chloe tells her that being on a parsley diet can make you have a natural abortion. Kate then goes on to constantly eat parsley and at one point in the film, even bathe in parsley. Ollie is \\"the king of contraception\\", where he counsels people on contraception for his job. Kate's friends see Kate and Ollie's relationship as the greatest relationship there could ever be and they envy her for it, even her lesbian friend thinks she would be crazy to leave him. Kate decides it is for the best not to tell Ollie about the pregnancy, despite her friends telling her she should. The film suggests that Kate may have had an affair with her \\"slow student\\" and may be the real reason why she wants an abortion. However, we find out that Ollie purposely poked holes in the condom, attempting to save their relationship together by having a child. Kate ultimately decides that breaking up with Ollie and moving on is for the best. Kate and Ollie both agree to meet at the lake in ten years, which is the spot the two of them first fell in love in the first place., what would be the answer ?

Kate is a bike-maintenance instructor who finds herself in a complex emotional dilemma. She has discovered that she is no longer in love with her long-term boyfriend, Ollie, who she has dated since high school. This already complicated situation is further exacerbated when Kate finds out she is pregnant. Given her conflicted feelings about Ollie and the uncertainty about her future with him, Kate decides that she doesn't want to have the baby. She also doesn't want to wait a requisite amount of time for a clinical abortion procedure. At this point, her friend Chloe, a herbalist, suggests a peculiar solution to Kate's pregnancy dilemma. Chloe tells Kate that consuming large amounts of parsley, known for its high vitamin C and volatile oil apiol, can induce a natural abortion. This is a controversial and potentially hazardous approach, but Kate finds herself desperate enough to try it. She starts consuming extensive amounts of parsley, and at one point, she even bathes in it in an attempt to expedite the process. Throughout this period, Kate decides to keep her pregnancy and her attempts to terminate it a secret from Ollie, despite her friends advising her to the contrary. The film insinuates that Kate's decision to seek an abortion might be influenced by a potential affair she had with a 'slow student'; however, this is not confirmed. Meanwhile, we discover that Ollie, who ironically works as a contraception counselor, has been deliberately sabotaging their birth control to get Kate pregnant. He hopes that having a child together might save their crumbling relationship. Despite these manipulative tactics, Kate remains resolute in her decision to abort the pregnancy and ends her relationship with Ollie. Ultimately, they agree to meet ten years later at the lake where they first fell in love, thus parting on a hopeful yet melancholic note.  So, in conclusion, Kate is the character who attempts to use parsley as a means to induce a natural abortion, showcasing the complexities of their relationship and her determination to break free from it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And now, the issue's gone political with increasingly vocal talk on Capitol Hill and in midterm campaigns calling for a travel ban to keep the disease from spreading in the U.S. Let's sort through the muck and get to the facts:. What's all this talk about a travel ban to deal with the Ebola outbreak? Some Republican lawmakers and a handful of Democrats are calling for a travel ban on people from the West African countries most affected by the disease. In Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, more than 4,400 people have died of the disease and one person has died of the disease in the U.S. That patient was diagnosed and ultimately died at a Texas hospital and now Gov. Rick Perry is joining calls for a travel ban after two nurses at the hospital contracted the disease. \\"Air travel is, in fact, how this disease crosses borders and it's certainly how it got to Texas in the first place,\\" Perry said. \\"I believe it is the right policy to ban air travel from countries that have been hit hardest by the Ebola outbreak.\\" Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said Saturday that such a travel ban \\"makes sense.\\" His state is on high alert after Amber Vinson, the second Dallas nurse to fall ill, flew to Cleveland and spent four days there after she had contracted the virus. But health experts at the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization aren't recommending a travel ban, and CDC chief Dr. Tom Frieden has even said the ban could hurt efforts to prevent an outbreak in the United States. Has the U.S. ever enforced that kind of a blanket travel ban? Not really. The U.S. has not banned people from a certain country from coming to the U.S. because of an epidemic. But President Ronald Reagan in 1987 did ban anyone infected with HIV/AIDS from entering in the United States. And for more than 20 years, that was U.S. government policy until President Barack Obama struck it down in 2009. That travel ban came at a time when AIDS was heavily stigmatized in the United States and amid misinformation and some public fear that the disease could spread through casual contact. Anyway, there's not much evidence to suggest that travel ban was successfully enforced or effective. Today, more than 1.1 million people are HIV positive. But remember, Ebola is nothing like AIDS according to Sen. (and Dr.) Rand Paul. Wait, just checking, Ebola can't be spread through the air right? No. No, no, no. The Ebola virus is only spread through contact with the bodily fluids of a person who has started showing symptoms of the disease. And while some have stoked fears that the disease could go airborne, the World Health Organization and other experts have said the chances that could happen are near to nil and are unaware of a virus that has ever mutated in that way. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? What about  epidemics like SARS and swine flu that have infected and killed way more people than Ebola? Why weren't there travel bans for those outbreaks? Nope. No travel bans for those diseases. Swine flu, also known as H1N1 flu, killed more than 284,000 people between 2009 and 2010 according to the CDC -- of which about 12,000 Americans. The WHO did not recommend a travel ban then either. And the United States never banned travel from China, the epicenter of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which tallied roughly the same number of cases -- over 8,000 -- in the same seven-month period as the Ebola epidemic. In fact, U.S. airports never implemented SARS passenger screenings at airports at a time when many other countries did. So why are politicians so certain a travel ban is the right way to go here? Simply put, a lot of members of Congress just want to keep the disease out of the United States and prevent any more cases from spring up at home. And they believe the best way to do that is to bar anyone who's been in West Africa recently -- or who has a passport from one of those countries. U.S. health officials grilled on Ebola at congressional hearing. Rep. Tim Murphy, who led the house panel that sharply questioned top health officials over Ebola on Thursday, insisted airport screenings aren't enough to keep people out of the country -- especially since infected people can carry  the disease for up to 21 days without showing any symptoms. And Rep. Fred Upton said Ebola \\"needs to be solved in Africa, but until it is we should not be allowing these folks in. Period.\\" OK, that sounds like it makes sense. Why are health experts saying the ban's a bad idea? The CDC's Frieden gets why that's the knee-jerk reaction to such a deadly disease. But a ban might actually make things worse, he said, because it could encourage people to lie about their travel to West Africa. And without that crucial information, Frieden said people infected with Ebola could slip into the United States without the CDC being able to track and monitor them for symptoms. But aren't more than two dozen African countries now enforcing some kind of travel ban? Yes. A few of the neighboring West African countries have actually sealed their borders altogether while many other countries on the continent are banning travel to and from those West African countries. But it's not clear how effective those bans are at keeping West Africans out in a region known for especially porous borders. \\"Even when governments restrict travel and trade, people in affected countries still find a way to move and it is even harder to track them systematically,\\" Frieden said last week. So you're saying it probably wouldn't work? Nope. At least not according to health officials. In fact, there are no direct flights to the United States from either Libera, Sierra Leone or Guinea, the three most affected countries. There are direct flights from Nigeria, which has dealt with 20 cases, but that country has been much more effective in containing the outbreak. Latest Ebola developments. How else could a travel ban hurt? The ban would especially hurt efforts in West Africa to contain the disease, where foreign health care workers have been central to the fight against the epidemic. And if American health workers are afraid they can't return to the United States, they might decide not to go at all. Preventing the disease from spreading further in West Africa is crucial to keep Ebola from continuing to spread.

The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea.  - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover.  - A University Royal Naval Unit (URNU) is a Royal Navy training establishment connected to a university, or a number of universities concentrated in one area. There are 15 URNUs nationwide in the UK, and each URNU has land-based facilities near the university in question, up to four training officers (members of the Royal Naval Reserve) and, with the exception of Devon, a dedicated training vessel (an \\"Archer\\"-class P2000 fast patrol boat).  - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.

I spent 4 hours waiting and when it was finally done I was charged 111.00 and told my service engine light was on (was not when i  gave it running to service writer who I watched drive it to the smog machine)  After the 4 hour waiting for the smog, I was told by the service writer, they smogged and it failed due to engine light on. let me explain,  I have been in the automotive industry here locally for over 15 years. I know if the check engine light is on it will not pass smog, so i would have never wasted my money in the first place! After I finished trying to flip the dealership over (with anger because of the lie i had to pay for) a lot porter comes up to me and asked me for a date, seriously??? My failed smog and 4 hours of wasted time cost me 111.00 and the time is not replaceable. I then had to go to a mechanic and get it fixed (he had unplugged a cord). Did i forget to mention when they gave me the 111.00 bill for a smog i never got, they also said I need 3,800.00 of work.   Again that was total b.s. i have been in this industry for over 15 years and though i look like a bimbo, I am smart and understand what b.s they were trying to blow up my bottom was just not true.

Mike (Michael Simpson) and King Gizmo (John King), famous for their sample-based music in the 1980s and 1990s, and specifically for their work on the albums \\"Paul's Boutique\\" by the Beastie Boys, \\"Odelay\\" by Beck, the soundtrack to the film \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"MMMBop\\" by Hanson.  - DGC Records (an acronym for David Geffen Company) is an American record label that currently operates as a division of Interscope-Geffen-A&M, which is owned by Vivendi S.A..  - \`\` Debra '' is a song by Beck . He had originally attempted to record \`\` Debra '' with the Dust Brothers for Odelay , but he thought that it was too tongue - in - cheek . It was debuted main - stream in 1996 , and , as Beck noted , \`\` it became the centerpiece of the whole set . It was the song that people would react to more than the songs that they 'd heard on the radio . So we kept playing it and playing it . '' The song finally made it on to Midnite Vultures in 1999 . The song maintains a cult following . The song was covered by German industrial artist Kompressor . Kompressor 's version is called \`\` Kompressor Want To Get With You . ''  - \\"MMMBop\\" is a song written and performed by the American pop rock band Hanson from their 1997 album \\"Middle of Nowhere\\". The song was nominated for two Grammys at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards in February 1998, and is the band's most successful single to date. \\"MMMBop\\" was phenomenally successful, especially for a debut single, reaching number one in 27 countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Mexico. In the United Kingdom, the song sold 710,000 copies and stayed at number one for 3 weeks.  - Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell; July 8, 1970), known mononymously as Beck, is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer and multi-instrumentalist. He is mostly known for his musical composition, as well as a palette of sonic genres.  - Midnite Vultures is the fourth official studio album and seventh overall by American alternative rock artist Beck, released in November 1999 by DGC Records. While similar to most of Beck's previous albums in its exploration of widely varying musical styles, \\"Midnite Vultures\\" didn't achieve the same blockbuster success as his breakthrough, \\"Odelay\\", though it was still critically and commercially well received.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A soundtrack, also written sound track, can be recorded music accompanying and synchronized to the images of a motion picture, book, television program or video game; a commercially released soundtrack album of music as featured in the soundtrack of a film or TV show; or the physical area of a film that contains the synchronized recorded sound.  - Paul's Boutique is the second studio album by the American hip hop group Beastie Boys, released on July 25, 1989, on Capitol Records. Featuring production by the Dust Brothers, the album was recorded in Matt Dike's apartment and the Record Plant in Los Angeles from 1988 to 1989, and mixed at the Record Plant. Subsequent remixes were done at the Manhattan-based Record Plant Studios. The album is noted for being almost completely composed of samples, excluding the group's vocal output.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - The Beastie Boys were an American hip hop group from New York City, formed in 1980. For the majority of their career, the group consisted of Michael \\"Mike D\\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar).  - Odelay is the second official studio album and fifth overall by American alternative rock artist Beck, originally released on June 18, 1996, by DGC Records.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s.

The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Dragonslayer Movie plot: A sixth-century post-Roman kingdom called Urland[2] is being terrorized by a 400-year-old dragon named Vermithrax Pejorative.[2] To appease the dragon, King Casiodorus (Peter Eyre) offers it virgin girls selected by lottery twice a year. An expedition led by a young man called Valerian (Clarke) seeks the last sorcerer, Ulrich of Craggenmoor (Richardson), for help. A brutish soldier from Urland named Tyrian (Hallam), who has followed the expedition, intimidates the wizard. Ulrich invites Tyrian to stab him to prove his magical powers. Tyrian does so and Ulrich dies instantly, to the horror of his young apprentice Galen Bradwarden (MacNicol) and his elderly servant Hodge (Sydney Bromley). Hodge cremates Ulrich's body and places the ashes in a leather pouch, informing Galen that Ulrich wanted his ashes spread over a lake of burning water. Galen inherits the wizard's magical amulet, and takes it upon himself to journey to Urland. On the way, he discovers Valerian is really a young woman, who disguised herself to avoid being selected in the lottery. In an effort to discourage the expedition, Tyrian kills Hodge; before dying, he hands Galen the pouch and dies with the words \\"Burning water...\\" on his lips. Arriving in Urland, Galen inspects the dragon's lair and attempts to seal its entrance by causing rocks to fall from the cliff. Tyrian apprehends Galen and takes him to the court of King Casiodorus. King Casiodorus guesses that Galen is not a real wizard and complains that his attack may have angered the dragon instead of killing it, as his own brother and predecessor once did. The king confiscates the amulet and imprisons Galen. His daughter Elspeth (Chloe Salaman) comes to taunt Galen, but is shocked when he informs her of rumours that the lottery is rigged to exclude her name and those who are rich enough to pay to have their children' names removed. Casiodorus is unable to lie convincingly when she confronts him regarding this. Meanwhile, the dragon frees itself from its prison and causes an earthquake. Galen... My question: What is Urland?

Hugh Redwald Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton, FBA (15 January 1914 - 26 January 2003), was a British historian of early modern Britain and Nazi Germany. He was Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford. Trevor-Roper was made a life peer in 1979 on the recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, choosing the title Baron Dacre of Glanton. Trevor-Roper was a polemicist and essayist on a wide range of historical topics, but particularly England in the 16th and 17th centuries and Nazi Germany. In 1980 at the age of 67, he became Master of Peterhouse, the oldest and smallest college in the University of Cambridge. His election, which surprised his friends, was engineered by a group of Fellows led by Maurice Cowling, then the leading Peterhouse historian. The Fellows chose him because Cowling's reactionary clique thought he would be an arch-conservative who would oppose the admission of women. In the event, Trevor-Roper feuded constantly with Cowling and his allies, while launching a series of administrative reforms. Women were admitted in 1983 at his urging. The British journalist Neal Ascherson summarised the quarrel between Cowling and Trevor-Roper as:  Lord Dacre, far from being a romantic Tory ultra, turned out to be an anti-clerical Whig with a preference for free speech over superstition. He did not find it normal that fellows should wear mourning on the anniversary of General Franco's death, attend parties in SS uniform or insult black and Jewish guests at high table. For the next seven years, Trevor-Roper battled to suppress the insurgency of the Cowling clique (\\"a strong mind trapped in its own glutinous frustrations\\"), and to bring the college back to a condition in which students might actually want to go there. Neither side won this struggle, which soon became a campaign to drive Trevor-Roper out of the college by grotesque rudeness and insubordination.  In a review of Adam Sisman's 2010 biography of Trevor-Roper, the Economist wrote that picture of Peterhouse in the 1980s was \\"startling\\", stating the college had become under Cowling's influence a sort of right-wing \\"lunatic asylum\\", who were determined to sabotage Trevor-Roper's reforms. In 1987 he retired complaining of \\"seven wasted years.\\"Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did he accomplish as Master of Peterhouse?","output":"As Master of Peterhouse, Hugh Redwald Trevor-Roper accomplished the introduction of administrative reforms as well as the admittance of women to the college.

Betty studied for her exam in the library instead of the coffee shop because the","output":"Betty studied for her exam in the library instead of the coffee shop because the library is quieter, providing her with a more conducive environment to focus on her studies. In comparison to the coffee shop, the library is specifically designed to cater to the needs of individuals looking for a space to read, study, and engage in research. As a result, it purposefully maintains a quiet atmosphere to enable patrons to concentrate on their tasks without disturbance. In contrast, coffee shops often serve as social hubs for people to meet, converse, and relax. The combined noise from the bustling environment, patrons' chatter, and background music can make concentrating on academic work significantly more challenging. Moreover, the constant ebb and flow of customers, coupled with the occasional whirring and grinding from the espresso machines, can be distracting for someone like Betty who needs a serene setting to immerse herself in her exam preparation. Additionally, libraries offer numerous resources, such as books, scholarly articles, and computers with internet access, all of which can prove incredibly useful for a student like Betty. The facility's knowledgeable staff is readily available to provide assistance in locating and utilizing these materials, thus streamlining the study process. Additionally, libraries often have private study rooms or carrels that allow for an even more secluded and focused environment. Furthermore, in the library, there is a better chance of Betty encountering fellow students preparing for the same exam or focusing on their studies. This atmosphere of shared academic engagement can motivate her to work harder and maintain concentration throughout her study session. Alternatively, her peers may even offer insight or assistance with any challenges she encounters, fostering a collaborative learning environment. On the other hand, coffee shops are primarily structured for patrons to enjoy their beverages and food items. Consequently, seating arrangements and table space might not be as comfortable or suitable for an extended study session. Additionally, the availability of tables and seats is not guaranteed during busy hours, which could negatively affect her study session. In conclusion, Betty chose to study in the library instead of the coffee shop because the library is quieter, offering her a more favorable setting for her exam preparation. The calm and focused ambiance, along with access to various resources and potential learning collaborations, provide the optimal environment for her to excel in her studies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the background: Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs.  and the situation: John has been hearing about climate change for last couple of years. He wants to understand the science behind climate change. For that, he picked up two eras in earth's history, era A and era B. Era A was hundred thousand years ago, and era B is in the present day. He now wants to compare these to eras to understand the change in climate better.  Answer the following question: Would era A have more or less carbon dioxide in the air than era B? Answer:","output":"Era B, which is the present day, would have more carbon dioxide in the air than Era A, which was hundred thousand years ago. This is due to the considerable increase in human activities that contribute to the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These activities include burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas) and deforestation. Burning fossil fuels is one of the primary sources of increased carbon dioxide. When we burn these fuels to produce energy (for vehicles, electricity, heating, etc.), carbon dioxide is released. This has accelerated especially since the Industrial Revolution, contributing significantly to the rise of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Deforestation and land clearing are other significant sources of increased carbon dioxide. Trees and plants absorb carbon dioxide as part of photosynthesis, thus reducing its amount in the atmosphere. When forests are cut down and lands are cleared (for agriculture, urbanization, etc.), not only is this carbon-absorbing capacity lost, but if the wood is burned or even left to decompose, the carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. So, due to these human activities, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere during Era B is substantially higher than what it would have been in Era A. This increasing concentration of carbon dioxide is one of the main factors contributing to the current climate change, as carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere."},{"instruction":"Given a sentence in the Japanese, provide an equivalent translation in Thai that retains the same meaning through the translation.

Increased explosive eruptions: If the snow or ice melts rapidly and mixes with the erupting magma, it can create a more explosive eruption due to the rapid production of steam. This is known as a phreatomagmatic eruption and is generally more violent than a solely magma-driven eruption. 2. Lahars and debris flows: The rapid melting of snow due to contact with the magma can generate large volumes of meltwater. This water can mix with loose volcanic material, like ash and rock debris, to form lahars or volcanic mudflows. These can travel down the slopes of the volcano at high speeds, causing destruction and posing a significant hazard to the surrounding area. 3. Insulation of lava flows: The snow can also provide some insulation for lava flows, slowing down their cooling process. As a result, the lava may travel further down the slopes of the mountain than it would otherwise. 4. Increased surface water: Snowmelt may increase the amount of water in nearby streams and rivers. This can impact the local ecosystem and may contribute to landslides and flooding, particularly in combination with volcanic debris. It is essential to note that these effects are secondary to the main driving forces behind volcanic eruptions, such as the pressure from the rising magma and the composition of magma. The winter storm and snow accumulation may influence the outcomes of smaller eruptions in certain cases, but they are not the primary causes of such eruptions or alteration in their size."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We can do that by adding 204*o to both sides of the equation: (-341*o) + (204*o) = (-204*o) - 137 + (204*o) This simplifies to: -137*o = -137 Now, let's solve for o.

Movie title: The Flight Before Christmas Movie plot: Niko, a young reindeer, was told by Oona, his mother, that his father is one of the \\"Flying Forces\\", Santa's flying sled reindeer. Niko dreams of joining his dad as a flying reindeer but he is unable to fly. While trying to fly with the encouragement of Julius, a flying squirrel who takes on the role of a mentor and father figure, the other young reindeer teased Niko. To avoid further teasing, Niko and his friend Saga leave their protected valley so Niko can practice without any disruptions. Niko gets spotted by two of the wolves, and escapes to his herd in panic, not thinking about the repercussions. While the herd is fleeing the valley, Niko overhears others talking of how his actions have damaged the herd. He decides to leave the herd in an attempt to find his father and Santa's Fell. When Niko is discovered missing, Julius chooses to look for Niko as he can search without leaving a trail as fresh snow is falling. Once he finds him, Julius cannot convince Niko to return to the herd and reluctantly joins him in the search for Santa's secret location. Meanwhile, Essie, a lost pet poodle, stumbles upon the wolf pack and is about to be eaten, but suggests to Black Wolf the idea of killing Santa's Flying Forces reindeer. Essie is considered Black Wolf's good luck charm for this idea and is spared, but is also forced to join the pack on this grim plan. Niko and Julius discover Wilma, a weasel, stuck in a small tree branch and rescue her. She is not pleased because she feels she has to save the lives of Niko and Julius before she can go on with her life. Julius and Niko get lost and separated in a sudden blizzard and Niko wakes under a pile of snow, unnoticed by the wolf pack that is nearby. Niko overhears Black Wolf resolving to kill Santa as well and take his place and bring death instead of presents to boys and girls.

She was officially broke. She didn't have enough money to get on the subway, but she looked rich. She was a television producer, earned 900 a week, and had a closetful of designer labels like Gucci and Louis Vuitton. But she also had a 20,221.40 credit card bill and an empty bank account. Karyn decided that it was time for a change. She built a website and simply asked people to help her out by sending her a dollar or two. On the site, Karyn honestly explained her situation. \\"If 20,000 people gave me just 1, I'd be home free.\\" Amazingly, it worked. Her website was visited by more than a million people. Although most donors just gave a few dollars, one generous donor sent 1,000. She was on TV and in newspapers and magazines. She was offered a book deal and a movie contract. And of course, she was able to pay off her credit card debt. She also sold her designer clothes on eBay. In her closet, where the Gucci purse once sat, Karyn keeps all the letters that people have sent her.

John wanted to install a shelf for his cactus but the","output":"wall he initially selected wasn't suitable, so he had to come up with an alternative plan to ensure the shelf was properly and securely mounted while also complementing the aesthetics of his room. To begin with, John researched different types of shelves that could support the weight of the cactus and its pot. He considered floating shelves, bracket shelves, and corner shelves as potential options, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each design. Floating shelves offered a minimalist and clean look, but might not be able to hold the weight of the cactus; bracket shelves were sturdy and reliable, but their visible support brackets might not match his desired aesthetic; and corner shelves made good use of space, but were somewhat limiting in terms of positioning. After selecting a sturdy yet visually appealing bracket shelf, John carefully considered the alternative wall options in his room. He used a stud finder to locate the wooden studs behind the drywall, noting their positions on the wall to determine the best spot for the shelf. He also assessed the amount of sunlight each wall received, as the cactus would need ample natural light to thrive. John eventually chose a wall with both sufficient structural support and sufficient sunlight exposure. Before installing the shelf, he gathered all the necessary tools and materials, including a level, a power drill, wall anchors, screws, and the shelf brackets. He also took measurements to determine the exact height and position for the shelf, accounting for the height of the cactus and ensuring that it would be easily accessible for watering and care. Following the manufacturer's instructions for the shelf brackets, John marked the locations for the pilot holes and drilled them into the wall, using wall anchors as needed to provide extra stability for the shelf. He then attached the brackets to the wall using screws, making sure they were level and secure. Once the brackets were firmly in place, John placed the shelf on top and fastened it to the brackets as directed. After confirming that the shelf was level and securely mounted, John proceeded to add some personal touches. He placed the cactus in a stylish ceramic pot and set it atop a decorative coaster to protect the shelf from potential water damage. In addition, he arranged a few other small plants and trinkets around the cactus, creating a visually appealing and cohesive display. Finally, John stood back to admire his handiwork. His carefully planned and installed shelf not only provided the necessary support for the cactus but also enhanced the overall aesthetic of his room. Through research, problem-solving, and attention to detail, John successfully completed his project, resulting in a functional and visually pleasing addition to his living space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(The phrase \\"web television\\" is also sometimes used to refer to Internet television in general, which includes Internet-transmission of programs produced for both online and traditional terrestrial, cable, or satellite broadcast.)  - Cable television is a system of delivering television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or, in the 2010s, light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with broadcast television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone services, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. Analog television was standard in the 20th century, but since the 2000s, cable systems have been upgraded to digital cable operation.  - Vimeo is a global video-sharing website in which users can upload, share and view videos. It was the first video sharing site to support high-definition video (started in October 2007). Vimeo was founded in November 2004 by Jake Lodwick and Zach Klein.  - A voicemail system (also known as voice message or voice bank) is a computer-based system that allows users and subscribers to exchange personal voice messages; to select and deliver voice information; and to process transactions relating to individuals, organizations, products and services, using an ordinary telephone. The term is also used more broadly to denote any system of conveying a stored telecommunications voice messages, including using an answering machine. Most cell phone services offer voice-mail as a basic feature; many corporate PBXs include versatile internal voice-messaging services, and *98 Vertical service code subscription is available to most individual and small business land line subscribers.  - Voice message refers to a message that could be sent to a destination using voice media. Voice itself could be 'packaged' and sent through the IP backbone so that it reaches its marked 'address'. In a technical sense, the process of sending 'voice packets' is a semi passive way of communication. However, given the speed at which it could be delivered can make the communication sound seamless.  - A portmanteau (; plural \\"portmanteaus\\" or \\"portmanteaux\\" ) or portmanteau word is a linguistic blend of words, in which parts of multiple words or their phones (sounds) are combined into a new word.  as in \\"smog\\", coined by blending \\"smoke\\" and \\"fog\\", or \\"popportunity\\", from \\"popping\\" and \\"opportunity\\", or \\"motel\\", from \\"motor\\" and \\"hotel\\". In linguistics, a portmanteau is defined as a single morph that represents two or more morphemes.  - A web series is a series of scripted or non-scripted videos, generally in episodic form, released on the Internet and part of the web television medium, which first emerged in the late 1990s and become more prominent in the early 2000s (decade). A single instance of a web series program can be called an episode or \\"webisode\\", however the latter term is not often used. In general, web series can be watched on a range of platforms, including desktop, laptop, tablets and smartphones. They can also be watched on television.   - A webisode is an episode of a series that is distributed as web television. It is available as either for download or in streaming, as opposed to first airing on broadcast or cable television. The format can be used as a preview, a promotion, as part of a collection of shorts, or a commercial. A webisode may or may not have been broadcast on TV. What defines it is its online distribution on the web, or through video-sharing web sites such as Vimeo or YouTube. While there is no set standard for length, most webisodes are relatively short, ranging from 315 minutes in length. It is a single web episode, but collectively is part of a web series, a form called web television that characteristically features a dramatic, serial storyline, where the primary method of viewership is streaming online over the Internet. The term \\"webisode\\" (a portmanteau formed from the words 'web' and 'episode') was first introduced in the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2009.  - A vertical service code (VSC) is a special code dialed prior to (or instead of) a telephone number that engages some type of special telephone service or feature. Typically preceded with an asterisk, or * (star), key on the touch tone keypad and colloquially referred to as star codes, most are two digits in length; as more services are developed, those that use \\"2\\" or \\"3\\" as the first digit are sometimes three digits in length.  - The answering machine, answerphone or message machine, also known as the telephone answering machine (or TAM) in the UK and some Commonwealth countries, ansaphone or ansafone (from a trade name), or telephone answering device (TAD), is used for answering telephones and recording callers' messages.  - Voicemail was an online television show that can be seen through the ABC.com Full Episode Player . Each short webisode features Mike , played by Ezra Godden , with his voicemail messages played in the background . As each message plays they help explain Mike 's actions . In the episode entitled \`\` Supplies '' , for example , Mike is seen making a giant ball out of masking tape while a series of voicemails from his boss asking him where the tape is going .  - YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California. The service was created by three former PayPal employeesChad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karimin February 2005. In November 2006, it was bought by Google for US1.65 billion. YouTube now operates as one of Google's subsidiaries. The site allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to favorites, report and comment on videos, and it makes use of WebM, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, and Adobe Flash Video technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media videos.

And I was wondering What will Cameron want to do next? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is difficult to definitively predict what Cameron will want to do next after seeing Casey this morning. However, I can generate a detailed response and suggest some possibilities based on general assumptions and logical reasoning. First, let's consider the relationship between Cameron and Casey. Are they friends, acquaintances, colleagues, or do they share another type of relationship? The nature of their relationship could greatly influence Cameron's next actions. Below are various scenarios that could play out, based on different relationship dynamics: 1. If Cameron and Casey are friends, it is possible that Cameron would want to make plans to spend more time together. This could include arranging a get-together with other friends, going to a movie or restaurant, or participating in a shared hobby or activity. 2. If Cameron and Casey are colleagues, there is a chance that Cameron might need to discuss work-related matters with Casey. This could involve collaborating on a project, seeking advice from Casey regarding a work issue, or discussing the progress of a team effort. 3. If Cameron and Casey have a more distant relationship, such as being acquaintances or distant relatives, Cameron may simply want to catch up on recent events in each others' lives. They could exchange updates on their families, careers, or experiences since they last saw each other. 4. If Cameron saw Casey in the context of a professional or service environment, such as a store or service provider, Cameron's next actions could be related to conducting business. This could include making a purchase, placing an order, or following up on a service request. 5. If Cameron and Casey have a romantic interest in each other, Cameron might want to take the opportunity to express his feelings or intentions towards Casey. This could involve setting up a date, exchanging messages, or discussing their shared interests in a more personal context. 6. If the meeting between Cameron and Casey was merely a coincidence, it is possible that Cameron's next actions may not be directly related to Casey at all. Instead, Cameron might continue with his usual routine and respond to the encounter with a brief acknowledgment, such as sending a text message or making a phone call to say that it was nice to see Casey. In summary, predicting what Cameron wants to do next after seeing Casey this morning is reliant upon the context and nature of their relationship, as well as the specific circumstances surrounding the encounter. There are numerous plausible scenarios that could play out, ranging from making further plans together to Cameron continuing with his day independently after acknowledging the meeting. Without more information, it is challenging to accurately determine Cameron's potential actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama  Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of  Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Raed Hijazi\\" correctly answer the question \\"President Clinton along with which top aid explore options regarding  Bin Laden, including expulsion from Afghanistan and execution?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Raed Hijazi\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"President Clinton along with which top aide explore options regarding Bin Laden, including expulsion from Afghanistan and execution?\\" The correct response should be \\"Samuel 'Sandy' Berger,\\" who was President Clinton's national security advisor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: GATT was formed in 1947.","output":"After thoroughly examining the provided text, it can be determined that the sentence \\"GATT was formed in 1947\\" is indeed true. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was established in 1947 as an international trade organization aimed at promoting multilateral trade by reducing tariffs and other trade barriers among its member countries. GATT functioned as a significant part of the global trading system and provided a framework for trade negotiations among its members. The text states that GATT established the rules of global trade in 1947. Since its formation, GATT has undergone multiple rounds of negotiations aimed at further liberalizing international trade, updating rules, and addressing new trade-related issues. This process has led to the modification of the original rules set by GATT in 1947, as mentioned in the text.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Noel Coward,a witty and urbane man,was friends with Louis Mountbatten.Mr Coward,a long-time admirer of all things naval,was commissioned to write a story loosely based on the loss of Mountbatten's ship.In a peculiarly British way it was considered that a film about the Royal Navy losing an encounter at sea would be good propaganda.It was also considered a good idea to have Mr Coward play the part of the ship's captain.Amang the many qualities needed to command a fighting ship,the ability to speak in a very clipped voice and sing sophisticated \\"point\\" songs does not come very high up the list at Admiralty House,or at least one would hope not.A captain must earn and retain the respect of the wardroom and the lower deck alike. Mr Coward might have had the respect of the gentlemen of the chorus at Drury Lane and Binkie Beaumont might have been terrified of him but his ability to tame,mould and direct a ship's crew in wartime must be brought into question.He folds himself languorously around the bridge,patronising the other ranks and barking orders at the officers,he only needed a silk dressing gown and a cigarette holder to seem right at home. Much is made of the \\"warship as a microcosm of British Society\\"theme,and the crew largely comprises of the usual cheery cockneys,canny northerners etc.without whom no war can be fought.They spend most of their time on board smoking,moaning about Lord Haw Haw and getting blown up. Never mind,there's plenty more where they came from.Once ashore they go straight to the pub where they spend most of their time smoking,moaning about Lord Haw Haw and getting blown up .By contrast Mr Coward lives in a dream cottage with a rose covered door somewhere very quiet with very little chance of getting blown up.He,his lady wife and their two rosy cheeked cherubs converse in ludicrously convoluted tones and said lady wife spends much of her time knitting things for the poor unfortunates who comprise his crew and who she refers to by their surnames.That nice young master Johnny Mills has a prominent role as a completely unbelievable lower deck type who worships Mr Coward in much the same way as a thrashed dog will worship its master.He marries his girlfriend after kissing her on the cheek,presumably on the grounds that she might be pregnant after such unfettered passion. So yes,we do have a microcosm of British society here,but perhaps not in the way the makers of \\"In which we serve\\" intended. At the end Mr Coward gets one last chance to patronise his men as the few survivors shuffle past him,\\"Goodbye Edwards,it was a privilege to sail with you\\"he enunciates as if he was reciting \\"How now brown cow\\". It may have been David Lean's feature debut,but the hand of Noel Coward looms large right across this picture.He was a funny and clever man,better suited to writing waspish plays about poor little rich girls and boys interspersed with the occasional wry song.He had a talent to amuse,no doubt,but he could neither write nor speak convincing dialogue. Being Noel Coward was a full-time job,he had no time to be a real person.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: These factors will be based on the type of fish that you want to catch. Short rods provide power for fish that give more fight while longer rods cast further. The power of a rod is how much weight in can lift, from light to extra heavy.  Rods can also be chosen based on the weight of the lure or the pound-test line that they are designed to be paired with.  Choose a graphite rod if you want a stiff yet sensitive experience and a fiberglass rod for a tough and powerful one.  Reels are classified as high or low speed  where the latter is used when needing more power to fight large fish. Some reels allow you to push a button to switch between high and low speed. Spinning rod and reels work well with top-water poppers and high-speed plugs. Use your dominant hand to hold the rod as you use your other hand to crank the handle.  Make sure you change the handle of your rod depending on which is your dominant hand. Spool the line by laying the rod on the floor and ensure that the line is going onto the reel at the same direction that the line is leaving the spool. Pinch the line and crank the reel handle a dozen times. With a slack line, drop the tip of the rod to check if the line starts to twist and spin. If it does, you have spooled the line in the wrong direction. Flip the spool over and continue in the right direction as you fill the reel. These rods work best when bottom fishing, jigging, long casting, or when using big baits. Use an open-face reel for casing or jigging to let out and retrieve the line quickly. Use a closed face reel when using lighter lures and baits. Make sure to use your thumb to control the speed of the spool and keep it slow. Baitcasting rods easily get tangled because the spool turns faster than the line as it leaves the rod. If the tangle isn’t too bad you may be able to untangle it by pulling more line off the reel. However, most baitcasting reel have either a centrifugal, magnetic, or electronic cast control to keep your line from getting tangled. Saltwater trolling rods carry a lot of line and their large bodies allow them to take extreme pressure for fighting large fish. These rods are shorter and stronger than casting rods. They may also come with a notched butt for a fighting belt or chair. Rods that are longer with a short butt are meant for use with a fighting belt or chair. Pair the rod with an appropriate line-test where a 20 pound rod and line combo works for sailfish, dolphin and marlin. Use 130 pound rod and line combo for billfish and bluefin tuna. These rods work best for either hovering over a target or to retrieve your line at high speeds. Use specialized tackle to work your lure at the correct speed, either very quickly or slowly depending on the fish. Use vertical jigging  with high-speed rods and metal lures for fast retrieval. In contrast, use rubber jigs to hover over the target or for slow, deliberate retrieval. Summary:","output":"This article is about choosing the right fishing rod, reel, and technique for different types of fish, considering factors like power, length, material, and speed, and also explaining how to spool the line and avoid tangles."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Question: I can use this background: When you go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled, you really don’t want to feel any pain. The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off.  Now, I have a new situation: Jake and his brother Jordan both have to go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled. Jake is allergic to the anesthetic unfortunately, so he has to have the procedure done without it. Jordan isn't allergic, so he is able to get his tooth pulled after an anesthetic is injected.  Answer this question please: Who will not experience a disruption of ion movement in their cell membranes? Answer:","output":"Jake will not experience a disruption of ion movement in their cell membranes. Since he is allergic to the anesthetic, he cannot receive the anesthetic injection that would affect the membrane structure and ion movement, thus he undergoes the tooth extraction without any anesthetic. On the other hand, Jordan, who is not allergic, receives the anesthetic injection and will experience a disruption in ion movement in his cell membranes. This disruption blocks his nerve impulses, preventing him from feeling pain during the procedure until the anesthetic wears off."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Title: The worst of all Schaums guides Product review: there are several problems with using this book as self-study material:1) it is dated - though published in 1989, and by definition out of date in 2010, the first 11 chapters list many techniques that even in that period are condsidered to be of historical interest in the computer age - interpolation, collocation operators etc2) there is not a single worked example3) the solved problems make several leaps of logic - I wouldnt have got anywhere without referencing Wikipedia, Cliffs briefs on differential equations, Schuams advanced calculus etc.4) sometimes new formulas are actually introduced in worked problems - eg Everet's formula5) problems are not self contained - referencing other chapters, other problems and sometimes other problems in other chapters.In short, this book was a struggle, and although it will give you conceptualization of different techniques, it will not give you a modern or holistic perspective on the field.

The management of Rockefeller Center shifted around this time. In November 1936, John Todd was featured in two New Yorker articles that emphasized his role in the complex's construction. At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose. Rockefeller Center was one of Nelson's primary business ventures until 1958, when he was elected Governor of New York.Public relations officials were hired to advertise the different parts of the complex, such as the gardens and the plaza.

In order to regain control of the custom duties, the emperor John VI Kantakouzenos made preparations to lower Constantinople's duties and most tariffs to undercut the Genoese in Galata. Still recovering from the civil war of 1341-1347, the emperor, with great difficulty, raised 50,000 hyperpyra from private sources  for a shipbuilding program for the expected war to come. When the tariffs and custom duties were finally lowered, merchant shipping coming through the strait bypassed Genoese Galata and diverted their ships across the Golden Horn to Byzantine Constantinople. The Genoese, financially hard-hit from this policy, declared war on the Empire, and in August 1348, a flotilla of ships sailed across the Horn and attacked the Byzantine fleet; despite their large scale preparations, the Byzantine fleet was destroyed by early 1349. The Byzantines retaliated by burning wharves and warehouses along the shore and catapulted stones and burning bales of hay into Galata, setting major parts of the city on fire. After several weeks of fighting, plenipotentiaries from Genoa came and negotiated a peace agreement. The Genoese agreed to pay a war indemnity of 100,000 hyperpyra and evacuated the land behind Galata which they illegally occupied; last, they promised never to attack Constantinople.

The sentence structure is subject-verb-object, starting with \\"the Royals\\" as the subject and using \\"acquired\\" as the verb. The additional information that Coco Crisp is a center fielder and the exchange involved relief pitcher Ramón Ramírez is also included. In the second sentence, the focus shifts to Coco Crisp, and the sentence begins with \\"the Royals CF Coco Crisp\\" as the subject. The verb \\"acquired\\" is still used, but the order of the two teams is reversed, mentioning the Boston Red Sox before relief pitcher Ramón Ramírez. The fact that the exchange took place in November is still included in both sentences. In summary, while the wording and structure of the two sentences are different, they both provide the same information about a November transaction involving the Royals, CF Coco Crisp, the Boston Red Sox, and RP Ramón Ramírez."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: What is the genre of the movie Movie plot title: Marnie Movie plot: The story opens as a woman with dark hair, seen only from behind, carries a suitcase along a train platform. The yellow purse tucked under her arm is presented at such an angle that it is suggestive of female genitalia.In the next scene, outraged business owner Sidney Strutt (Martin Gabel) rants to a pair of detectives that he was \\"cleaned out\\" by a female employee named Marion Holland whom he obviously hired for her looks despite her lack of professional references. A client of Strutt's, Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), overhears the conversation and says that he remembers this woman, wryly referring to her as \\"the brunette with the legs.\\"The woman, real name Marnie Edgar (Tippi Hedren) is a compulsive thief, and has made off with almost 10,000 stashed in the yellow purse. She changes her appearance, going from brunette to blonde, and flees with the cash, journeying south to a town in Virginia where she keeps her beloved horse, Forio, stabled. She then visits her mother Bernice (Louise Latham) in Baltimore. She lavishes her mother with expensive gifts in an attempt to impress her and win her love, but the woman is cold and distant with Marnie, showing much more maternal affection towards a little neighbor girl named Jessie whom she babysits. Marnie's intense jealousy of Jessie seems inappropriate for a grown woman to express, and along with her panic over a bouquet of red gladiolas and her mother's insistence that \\"decent\\" women don't need men, the first hints of the dysfunction that drives Marnie to lie and steal appear.Time goes by and Marnie constructs a new identity, Mary Taylor, with the intent to run her scam again on another victim. She applies for a job at a printing company in Philadelphia owned by none other than Mark Rutland. Despite her now chestnut hair, he recognizes Marnie as the woman who stole from Strutt, but, excited by the thrill of chasing and capturing the attractive criminal, he hires her. Marnie robs Rutland, too, but he anticipated this outcome and manages to track Marnie down. Instead... A:","output":"The genre of the movie \\"Marnie\\" can be classified as a psychological thriller and drama. Released in 1964, this film directed by Alfred Hitchcock is known for its exploration of the main character's mental state – Marnie Edgar, played by Tippi Hedren – and the suspenseful elements revolving around her actions as a compulsive thief. Throughout the plot, various themes such as crime, blackmail, complicated relationships, and deep-rooted psychological issues are intertwined, leading to a narrative that keeps the audience captivated and intrigued, which are characteristic elements of a psychological thriller. Additionally, the portrayal of complex characters as well as the exploration of their emotions, choices, and backgrounds gives the film a strong dramatic quality.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Drusilla, or Dru, is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt for the American television series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. The character is portrayed by American actress Juliet Landau. Drusilla is introduced alongside her lover Spike (James Marsters) in the second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer to serve as new antagonists to the series' heroine, vampire Slayer Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and alongside Darla (Julie Benz) and Wolfram & Hart as the main antagonist of the second season of Angel. In contrast to the series' previous central villain, the ancient and ceremonious Master (Mark Metcalf), Spike and Dru were introduced as a more unconventional but equally dangerous pair of vampires. Actress Juliet Landau said that when she first received the script, it indicated that Drusilla's accent could be British or American. Landau felt Drusilla \\"should really be Cockney, especially with the whole Sid and Nancy analogy.\\" Though she never considered portraying Drusilla with a Southern American accent, as James Marsters had considered for Spike, she notes that invited comparisons with Blanche DuBois would also have been interesting.  Drusilla's madness is exhibited in her often-strange dialogue, which is peppered with non sequiturs like \\"Spike, do you love my insides? All the parts you can't see?\\" Her behavior is girlish, accompanied by a dark, ironic twist. For instance, when she is happy, she will squeal and laugh like a young child, but she is happiest when committing torture, hunting humans, or witnessing mass destruction. She has a fondness for china dolls but keeps them blindfolded or gagged. She also loves flowers and cute animals, but is not sane enough to care for them; as she says, \\"Do you like daisies? I plant them but they always die. Everything I put in the ground withers and dies.\\" She even goes so far as to own a Pekingese puppy. She speaks in a soft, mellow voice which contrasts with her dialogue. All of \\"white hats\\" (both Scoobies and Angel's Investigations) are doubtful about how to deal with her, originally an innocent victim. Mostly and obviously Angel.  Drusilla's costumes were initially intended to be a \\"cross between a Victorian period look and the Kate Moss heroin chic fashion look,\\" says Landau. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Ok, dear. So, Drusilla, or Dru, is like a character in a story, but the story is on the TV. She's in two shows, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\". Can you imagine a really bad person? That's Dru. She's not just naughty, she's a villain who loves to do mean things like hurting people or destroying stuff. You know when you play pretend, and you make up all kind of silly words? Well, Dru talks in weird, silly ways too. Imagine your favorite doll or teddy bear, now think if you covered their eyes or mouth - that's what Dru does with her dolls. Even though she likes pretty flowers and cute animals, she's not good at taking care of them, so they don't stay pretty for long. And she dresses up in really old, fancy clothes that might remind you of a princess from a really long time ago.  But remember, just because Dru does bad things on TV, that doesn't mean it's okay for us to do them. This is just a story, and in real life, we should always be kind to each other, okay? Now, do you have any questions about this?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Information:  - The United States Naval Academy (also known as USNA, Annapolis, or simply Navy) is a four-year coeducational federal service academy in Annapolis, Maryland, United States. Established on 10 October 1845, under Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft, it is the second oldest of the United States' five service academies, and educates officers for commissioning primarily into the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. The campus is located on the former grounds of Fort Severn at the confluence of the Severn River and Chesapeake Bay in Anne Arundel County, east of Washington, D.C. and southeast of Baltimore. The entire campus is a National Historic Landmark and home to many historic sites, buildings, and monuments. It replaced Philadelphia Naval Asylum, in Philadelphia, that served as the first United States Naval Academy from 1838 to 1845 when the Naval Academy formed in Annapolis.  - Fort Severn, in present-day Annapolis, Maryland, was built in 1808 on the same site as an earlier American Revolutionary War fort of 1776. Although intended to guard Annapolis harbor from British attack, it never saw action during the War of 1812. The United States Naval Academy acquired Fort Severn and two other military bases from the United States Army on 19 October 1845. The Academy used the structure for classrooms until its demolition in 1909.  - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service .  - Thomas James \`\` Tom '' Hamilton ( December 26 , 1905 -- April 3 , 1994 ) was an American football player , coach , college athletics administrator , and naval aviator who rose to the rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy . He served as the head football coach at the United States Naval Academy from 1934 to 1936 and again from 1946 to 1947 and at the University of Pittsburgh in 1951 and 1954 , compiling a career college football record of 28 -- 32 -- 1 . Hamilton was also the athletic director at the Naval Academy from 1948 to 1948 and at Pittsburgh from 1949 to 1959 . From 1959 to 1971 , he was the commissioner of the Athletic Association of Western Universities , renamed the Pacific - 8 Conference in 1968 and now known as the Pac - 12 Conference . Hamilton was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1965 .  - Rear admiral is a naval commissioned officer rank above that of a commodore and captain, and below that of a vice admiral. It is generally regarded as the lowest of the \\"admiral\\" ranks, which are also sometimes referred to as \\"flag officers\\" or \\"flag ranks\\". In many navies it is referred to as a two-star rank (OF-7).  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - The University of Pittsburgh (commonly referred to as Pitt) is a state-related research university located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1787 after the American Revolutionary War, it was founded on the edge of the American frontier as the Pittsburgh Academy. It developed and was renamed as Western University of Pennsylvania by a change to its charter in 1819. After surviving two devastating fires and various relocations within the area, the school moved to its current location in the Oakland neighborhood of the city; it was renamed as the University of Pittsburgh in 1908. For most of its history, Pitt was a private institution, until 1966 when it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Graziano was the son of Ida Scinto and Nicola Barbella. Barbella, nicknamed Fighting Nick Bob, was a boxer with a brief fighting record. Born in Brooklyn, Graziano later moved to an Italian enclave centered on East 10th Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A in Manhattan's East Village. He grew up as a street fighter and learned to look after himself before he could read or write. As he grew older and seeing no other way to raise his standard of living, Graziano signed a few boxing contracts, but the rigors of training disinterested him. He and his early managers went their separate ways but eventually, he was picked up by Irving Cohen who had the sense to give him a long leash. Cohen changed the young fighter's name from Barbella to Graziano (his grandfather's surname) and lined up a fight. Refusing to train much, Graziano nevertheless showed his killer instinct and won by a knockout. Other fights were lined up with Cohen trying, in his subtle way, to overmatch Graziano, get him defeated, and thereby show him the value of getting into condition. He even demanded a match against Sugar Ray Robinson.  In March 1945, at Madison Square Garden, Graziano scored a major upset over Billy Arnold, whose style was similar to that of Sugar Ray Robinson; he was a slick boxer with lightning-fast combinations and a knockout punch. The Ring magazine and various newspapers across the United States touted Arnold as the next Joe Louis or Sugar Ray Robinson. Arnold was a heavy favorite to defeat Graziano and then to go on to fight for the world title, but Graziano absorbed a beating in the early going, before going on to batter and knock Arnold out in the third round of the scheduled eight-round bout. Following his defeat to Graziano, Arnold was never the same.  Graziano is most famous for his three title bouts with Tony Zale, all for the middleweight title. In their first match (September 27, 1946), after flooring Graziano in the first round, Zale took a savage beating from him, and was on the verge of losing the fight by TKO. However, he rallied and knocked him out in the sixth round to retain his title. The rematch, a year later in Chicago (July 16, 1947), was a mirror image of their first fight. The referee almost stopped the second fight in the third round because of a severe cut over Graziano's left eye, which would have awarded the victory to Zale, but Graziano's cutman, Morris (\\"Whitey\\") Bimstein, was able to stop the bleeding to let the fight continue. Graziano was battered around the ring, suffered a closed eye and appeared ready to lose by a knockout, then rallied and knocked Zale out in the sixth round, becoming world middleweight champion. Their last fight was held in New Jersey the following year (June 10, 1948). Zale regained his crown, winning the match by a knockout in the third round. The knockout blows consisted of a perfect combination of a right to Graziano's body, then a left hook to his jaw. He was knocked unconscious. His last attempt at the middleweight title came in April 1952, when he fought Sugar Ray Robinson. He dropped him to his knee with a right in the third round. Less than a minute later, Robinson knocked him out for the count with a right to the jaw. He retired after losing his very next fight, a 10-round decision to Chuck Davey.

Step 1: Combine the g terms 4721*g - 4896*g = -175*g (subtract 4896*g from 4721*g) Now, our equation is: -175*g + 3983 = -3192 Step 2: Isolate the g term To do this, we'll subtract 3983 from both sides of the equation. -175*g + 3983 - 3983 = -3192 - 3983 -175*g = -7175 (combine the constants) Step 3: Solve for g Now, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -175.

It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.  - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population.

While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world.  - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.  - The Seaward River is a river in New Zealand 's South Island . It flows northeast from its origins in north Canterbury 's Puketeraki Range , reaching the Hurunui River 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) southwest of Culverden .  - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France. The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\").  - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time.

The medical condition glaucoma affects which part of the body?","output":"Glaucoma is a medical condition that primarily affects the eye, specifically the optic nerve, which is responsible for transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain. It is a group of diseases that can cause progressive damage to the optic nerve, resulting in diminished vision, and ultimately, if left untreated, blindness. The critical factor contributing to glaucoma is often an increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP). This increased pressure occurs when the fluid, called aqueous humor, which normally circulates in the front part of the eye between the cornea and the lens, builds up. The buildup is usually a result of either inadequate drainage or overproduction of the fluid. As pressure within the eye increases, it exerts unwanted stress on the optic nerve, leading to nerve damage and vision loss. There are several types of glaucoma, with the most common forms being the following: 1. Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG): This is the most prevalent form of glaucoma, characterized by a slow and almost unnoticeable increase in intraocular pressure. The drainage angle (where the aqueous humor exits the eye) appears to be open and normal, but the fluid drains too slowly. This gradual increase in eye pressure can damage the optic nerve without noticeable symptoms initially, gradually affecting peripheral vision and eventually central vision if left untreated. 2. Angle-Closure Glaucoma (ACG): A more severe and less frequent form of glaucoma, angle-closure glaucoma occurs when the drainage angle (where the aqueous humor exits the eye) becomes blocked abruptly, leading to a sudden rise in intraocular pressure. This type of glaucoma can lead to severe pain, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and redness in the affected eye. It is considered a medical emergency and requires urgent treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. 3. Normal-Tension Glaucoma (NTG): In this form of glaucoma, optic nerve damage occurs with intraocular pressure within the standard range. The exact cause of normal-tension glaucoma is still unknown, although some experts believe that certain individuals might be more susceptible to optic nerve damage from regular IOP due to genetic factors or decreased blood flow. 4. Secondary Glaucoma: This type of glaucoma develops as a secondary effect of another eye-related condition or an underlying disease, such as inflammation, trauma, or a tumor. Treatment depends on addressing the primary cause along with managing the increased intraocular pressure. 5. Congenital Glaucoma: This is a rare form of glaucoma that occurs in infants and is typically inherited, resulting from congenital abnormalities in the eye's drainage system. Symptoms may include tearing, sensitivity to light, and cloudiness of the cornea. If diagnosed early, congenital glaucoma is often treatable through surgery or medication. While anyone can develop glaucoma, specific risk factors include being over 60 years old, having a family history of the condition, being of African, Hispanic, or Asian descent, having high blood pressure, diabetes, nearsightedness, or a previous eye injury. Regular eye exams with an ophthalmologist can help detect glaucoma early, and if diagnosed, appropriate therapies, such as prescription eye drops, laser treatment, or surgery, can slow or prevent further optic nerve damage and vision loss."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? waking coma","output":"Based on the brief text provided for the review, \\"waking coma,\\" it is difficult to conclusively determine whether this review has a positive or negative opinion of the movie. The phrase itself can be interpreted in various ways, which makes it quite vague as a standalone comment. However, I'll attempt to explore the possible interpretations and how they could shed light on the reviewer's opinion. 1. Literal interpretation: The words \\"waking coma\\" may imply that the movie was so dull and uninteresting that it put the reviewer into a state that can be metaphorically compared to being in a coma while awake. This suggests that the movie failed to capture the reviewer's attention or provide any form of stimulation. In this case, the review would be considered negative, as it is a critique of the movie's ability to engage and entertain the viewer. 2. Thematic interpretation: Depending on the movie in question, the phrase \\"waking coma\\" might be a reference to a central theme or concept in the movie. If the movie revolves around a character in a coma or a similar situation, this could be a poignant observation highlighting the film's exploration of such themes. In this context, the review could be seen as either positive or negative, depending on how well the reviewer thinks this theme was executed in the movie. 3. Contradictory interpretation: \\"Waking coma\\" could also be interpreted as a contradiction, perhaps suggesting that while the movie had some engaging or exciting elements, it also had significant issues that left the viewer feeling unfulfilled or unable to fully invest in the story. In this case, the review would be considered mixed, with both positive and negative aspects being addressed. In conclusion, without additional context or information about the movie or the reviewer's preferences, it is difficult to categorically label the review as either positive or negative. The phrase \\"waking coma\\" itself may have been intended to be deliberately ambiguous, requiring the reader to consider the multiple possible interpretations presented above. It is important to remember that a single phrase or sentence may not be sufficient to accurately assess a reviewer's opinion, especially when the phrase is as cryptic as \\"waking coma.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis.

A marching band is a group in which instrumental musicians perform while marching, often for entertainment or competition. Instrumentation typically includes brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments. Most marching bands wear a uniform, often of a military style, that includes an associated school or organization's colors, name or symbol. Most high school marching bands, and some college marching bands, are accompanied by a color guard, a group of performers who add a visual interpretation to the music through the use of props, most often flags and rifles. Many bands have auxiliaries that add a visual component to the performance. For ceremonial bands, this could be a traditional color guard or honor guard. For drum & bugle corps and corps-style field bands, this could include Dance lines, majorettes, Auxiliary units may be collectively referred to as color guard or visual ensemble.  Auxiliaries may perform as independent groups. In the early 1970s, color guards began to hold their own competitions in the winter (after the American football season, and before the beginning of the summer drum and bugle corps season). These became known as winter guard. There are also numerous dance competitions in the off-season.  The color guard of a marching band or drum and bugle corps may contain sabers, mock rifles, and tall flags. In modern bands, other props are often used: flags of all sizes, horizontal banners, vertical banners, streamers, pom-poms, even tires, balls, and hula hoops or custom built props. The color guard may also employ stage dressing such as backdrops, portable flats, or other structures. These can be used simply as static scenery or moved to emphasize block drill, and are often used to create a \\"backstage\\" area to store equipment and hide personnel.  While military color guards were typically male, band color guards tend to be primarily female, though it is becoming more common for men to join as well. A few independent units are all-male. Guard members nearly always wear a special uniform or costume that is distinctive from that of the band, not necessarily matching in design or color. The men's and women's guard uniforms are usually designed in one of two ways: nearly identically, but with gender-specific parts (i.e. skirts) adapted for the use of the opposite sex; or complimentarily, with the two uniforms designed similarly but with variations in color or form. The color guard uniform, especially in a high school marching band, need not be in school colors; in fact, they rarely are. These uniforms are designed to represent a certain aspect of the halftime show, characterize the guard members through costumes, or tell some sort of story, and can thus be in any design or color (a surprisingly common complaint among the high school audience is that guard uniforms and equipment \\"aren't school colors\\").  Indoor color guards have become popular within high schools and universities throughout the United States. These groups perform a theme-based show in competitions after the outdoor marching band season ends. Indoor color guard shows are typically performed in school gymnasiums and are adjudicated. Do they compete any other time of the year?","output":"Yes, marching bands and their auxiliaries, including color guards, compete throughout the year. The competitive calendar can be divided into several segments: 1. Fall season: This is the primary season for high school marching band competitions, which typically take place from September through November. During this time, bands perform at football games and local, regional, or even national marching band competitions. Show themes often vary, and the performances showcase the band's musical and visual skills. 2. Winter season: As mentioned earlier, winter guard competitions occur between late fall and early spring, typically from December through April. Winter guard is an indoor activity in which the color guard performs theme-based shows to recorded music in school gymnasiums or other indoor venues. This season allows color guard members to continue developing their skills outside of the traditional marching band season.  3. Off-season competitions: Outside of the fall marching band and winter guard seasons, individual sections or performers within a marching band may also participate in various off-season competitions. For example, drummers may compete in solo or ensemble percussion events, while other instruments may take part in local or regional solo and ensemble festivals. These events provide musicians with additional opportunities to showcase their skills and receive expert feedback. 4. Summer season: Drum and bugle corps, which are similar to marching bands, typically perform and compete during summer months when students are on their school break. Drum and bugle corps performances are often more rigorous and advanced than high school marching bands, attracting performers from various age groups and experience levels. In the United States, Drum Corps International (DCI) is the largest competitive circuit for drum and bugle corps, hosting events from June through August across the country. In summary, there are various opportunities for marching bands and their members, including color guards, to compete and perform throughout the year. These competitive events help participating musicians hone their skills, foster camaraderie, and provide opportunities to showcase their talents to diverse audiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is confronted by rival archaeologist RenÃ© Belloq and the indigenous Hovito people. Surrounded and outnumbered, Indy surrenders the idol to Belloq and escapes aboard a waiting floatplane. Jones returns to his teaching position at Marshall College, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform him that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant; the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra is the key to finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried. The agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to Nepal and discovers that Abner has died, and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter Marion. Jones visits Marion at her tavern, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander, Arnold Toht. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece, but when Jones returns to the bar to fight the Nazis and save Marion, her bar is accidentally set on fire; during the fight, the headpiece ends up in the fire and Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece, and flees the tavern screaming. Indy and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion decides to accompany Indy in his search for the Ark so he can repay his debt to her.

Multi-select problem: How does the next paragraph end? How to prevent tear staining in dogs  Understand tear stains.  Tears contain a chemical called porphyrin that turns rust-colored when exposed to the air. A process called oxidation causes an eventual color stain to a dog's fur. Available choices: (a). This color is then absorbed through the coat, leaving behind no visible need to repair. Overnight stains are considered a fair sign and your dog may be able to fight eye infection.. (b). Watch out for extreme tear stains, whether they're flare stains, extensive grime on the skin, or areas that are not porphyrin resistant. Pure oxidation relies heavily on the presence of nitrates in the skin so that eventually the stain will disappear.. (c). Just like hair dye, it takes a while for the porphyrin to stain fur. Tear staining is a result of tears not being wiped away before the fur gets stained.. (d). Though stain removal is quick and easy, it costs significantly more than professional bleaching to stop the stain. The chemical can remove minor stains, acidic stains, and others, but it can generally not be removed in a single stroke..","output":"Tear staining in dogs can be unsightly and, if left untreated, may lead to more serious issues.

Somewhat of a specialist regarding American terrorism and due to teach a class on terrorism at the university, Michael starts to become suspicious of his new suburban neighbors, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack), whom he's just met after taking their son, Brady (Mason Gamble), to the emergency room following a reported fireworks accident.At first his suspicions are based on little things such as Oliver's architectural blueprints that seem to be for something other than the shopping mall he claims he's building, as well as pieces of mail that contradict where Oliver said he attended college. Neither his girlfriend and former student, Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis), nor his wife's former FBI partner, Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), believe any of his wild theories.After doing some digging, Michael discovers that Oliver's real name is William Fenimore, and that he built a pipe bomb and used it to try to blow up a postal office in Kansas when he was 16. William/Oliver confronts Michael over his looking into William's past. He reveals that 'Oliver Lang' is the name of his friend, who died in a hunting accident. William's family had owned a farm but it went broke because the government 'appropriated' the river that ran through it 'for other uses'. As a result the crops died and they could not raise any animals. William's dad then killed himself and made it look like a tractor accident so the family could claim the life insurance. He left a note for William explaining everything. He built the pipe bomb to get back at the government. When William's friend Oliver died he took his name the next day to hide his past.

In Thunderbirds what was the unnamed villain known as?","output":"In the original 1965-1966 television series Thunderbirds, the unnamed villain who constantly threatens the International Rescue organization and its heroic pilots is commonly referred to as \\"The Hood.\\" This mysterious character was created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, the masterminds behind the show and its groundbreaking use of marionette puppets and scale models, which they called \\"Supermarionation.\\" The Hood is portrayed as a master criminal with a penchant for sabotage, espionage, and acts of terrorism. His primary motivation is to acquire the secrets of International Rescue's advanced technology for his own nefarious purposes. He is highly skilled in various fields, including disguise, telepathy, and even advanced knowledge of electronics and engineering. As an international criminal, The Hood is relentless in his pursuit of the Thunderbirds and their top-secret technology. He is the half-brother of Kyrano, the housekeeper of Tracy Island (International Rescue's secret base), which further complicates matters. The Hood exploits his familial connection to Kyrano through telepathic control and coercion to get unauthorized access to the island and gather sensitive information. This familial link also adds depth to The Hood's characterization and highlights the show's exploration of the complex nature of the villain-hero relationship. Despite his intelligence and cunning, The Hood is repeatedly defeated by the International Rescue team, with the show's protagonists—Jeff Tracy and his five sons at the helm of technologically advanced rescue vehicles known as Thunderbirds—often saving the day. Throughout the series, The Hood features prominently in several episodes, such as \\"Trapped in the Sky,\\" \\"Edge of Impact,\\" \\"Desperate Intruder,\\" and \\"Mission to the Unknown,\\" among others. In these storylines, his schemes range from sabotaging aircraft to trying to steal nuclear secrets, always to be foiled by the Thunderbirds team. In later iterations and adaptations of the show, including the 2004 live-action film Thunderbirds, The Hood continued to be a prominent villain. Still, his character and motivation have evolved from the original series. In the 2004 film, he is portrayed by actor Ben Kingsley, and his backstory is expanded to highlight his motivation for vengeance against International Rescue due to past failures. In conclusion, the unnamed villain in the Thunderbirds series is widely known as \\"The Hood,\\" a master criminal with intricate connections to the heroes he opposes. The character serves both as a persistent antagonist and as a complex figure whose relationships and motivations are explored throughout the series and its adaptations. His constant pursuit of International Rescue and the Thunderbirds highlights not only his own cunning and determination but also the heroism and resourcefulness of the central characters, making him an indispensable part of the ever-popular Thunderbirds narrative."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

This is because Island 1 experienced a drought in recent years, which resulted in fewer seeds being available for the finches to eat. Due to this scarcity of food, birds with smaller beaks that could only eat smaller seeds faced more competition and difficulty in finding enough food to survive. Conversely, birds with larger beaks that could crack and eat seeds of all sizes were at an advantage during this time since they had access to a wider variety of food sources. As a result, many small-beaked birds died during the drought, leading to a decrease in their population on Island 1. Meanwhile, birds with larger beaks had higher survival and reproduction rates, causing an increase in their population and an overall increase in the average beak size among the finches on Island 1. This is an example of evolution by natural selection, where the traits best suited to the environment (in this case, large beaks) become more prevalent in the population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Coming off their blowout win over the Eagles, the Broncos traveled to Arlington, Texas, for an interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium. The Cowboys grabbed a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tony Romo to wide receiver Dez Bryant, followed by running back DeMarco Murray rushing for a 4-yard touchdown. The latter score occurred after a fumble by Broncos' wide receiver Eric Decker. The Broncos later got on the scoreboard, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 4-yard shovel pass to tight end Julius Thomas for a touchdown. Early in the second quarter, a 43-yard field goal by placekicker Dan Bailey gave the Cowboys a 17-7 lead. The Broncos then reeled off 21 unanswered points, with Manning adding two more touchdown passes &#8212; a 2-yarder to Decker and a 9-yarder to Thomas, followed by Manning rushing for a 1-yard touchdown on a bootleg play. A 48-yard field goal by Bailey at the end of the first half narrowed the Broncos' lead to 28-20. The Broncos added to their lead midway through the third quarter, with Manning connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker. However, the Cowboys subsequently began chipping away at the Broncos' lead, with Romo connecting on an 82-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrance Williams. A 48-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater gave the Broncos a 38-27 lead, but the Cowboys further narrowed the Broncos' lead, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Bryant (with an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt). On the Broncos' next possession, Manning threw his first interception of the season, and the Cowboys subsequently re-claimed the lead early in the fourth quarter, with Romo throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten, coupled with a two-point pass from Romo to Williams. The Broncos tied the game at 41-41 on their next possession, with a 50-yard field goal by Prater, however, on the Cowboys' next possession, Romo connected on a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cole Beasley to give the Cowboys a 48-41 lead with 7:19 remaining in the fourth quarter. Manning subsequently led the Broncos on a 9-play, 73-yard drive, which culminated with running back Knowshon Moreno rushing for a 1-yard touchdown to tie the game at 48-48 with 2:24 remaining in the fourth quarter. Two plays into the Cowboys' next possession, as the Cowboys were attempting a game-winning drive, Romo was intercepted by Broncos' linebacker Danny Trevathan at the Cowboys' 24-yard line just before the two-minute warning. On the fourth play of the Broncos' final possession, the Broncos were facing a 3rd-and-1 at the Cowboys' 2-yard line, after the Cowboys had exhausted two of their three team timeouts. Moreno earned a crucial first down after Manning implored him to go down before reaching the goal line instead of scoring a touchdown, which forced the Cowboys to burn their final timeout with 1:35 remaining in the fourth quarter. After three kneel-downs by Manning, Prater nailed the game-winning 28-yard field goal as time expired. This was the only game during the 2013 season in which the Broncos wore their alternate navy blue jerseys.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Where did an interagency group travel to in 1999 and 2000 to find out about  Bin Laden's finances?\\" is \\"Russia\\"?","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"Where did an interagency group travel to in 1999 and 2000 to find out about Bin Laden's finances?\\" is not \\"Russia\\".

The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.

Dan found out he is healthy and had normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels. Ben however, was told that he had a disease called hypercalcaemia and had to start a treatment for that.  Which brother experienced less nausea?  Hint: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Dan, who is healthy and has normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels, would be the brother who experienced less nausea. This is because Ben has hypercalcaemia, which is characterized by high serum calcium levels and can lead to symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and other complications mentioned in the hint. Dan, having normal calcium levels, would not be experiencing these symptoms related to hypercalcaemia and therefore would have less nausea than Ben."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Process: - A bird lays eggs in a nest - The parent(s) incubate the eggs - The eggs hatch - The mother (and sometimes the father) bird take care of the baby birds - The baby birds grow up and get their flight feathers - The young birds learn to fly and leave the nest - The adult birds find mates and mate.  Question: suppose Male birds get less food because it is too hot happens, how will it affect Females will not hatch more chicks.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of male birds getting less food because of extreme heat would likely have a significant impact on the second effect mentioned, that females will not hatch more chicks. This impact can be analyzed through various factors that influence the reproductive success and overall life cycle of birds. Firstly, when male birds receive less food, their ability to perform essential tasks such as territory defense, courtship displays, and mate attraction could be diminished due to reduced energy reserves. A decrease in these critical behaviors may lead to fewer mating opportunities for male birds, which would subsequently reduce the number of fertilized eggs produced by females. In this scenario, there would be a lessened possibility of females hatching more chicks, as fewer males are energetically capable of engaging in successful mating behaviors. Secondly, inadequate food for male birds could result in a decline of their overall health and survival rates. With less food available to them, males may become weaker, more susceptible to diseases, and less able to evade or fight off predators. This further reduction in the number of viable male birds in a population would increase competition among females, possibly lowering the probability of females finding mates and, consequently, hatching more chicks. Thirdly, the female birds may also suffer from indirect consequences of the decrease in food intake of male birds. As it is not uncommon for both parents to share the responsibility of parenting, a weakening male partner due to insufficient nutrition may struggle to provide food for the female and the chicks, or adequately protect the nest. This could lead to females investing less energy in laying eggs and hatching more chicks, thereby prioritizing their own survival and that of their existing offspring. In this case, having less available male support could lead to a significant reduction in female birds hatching more chicks. Therefore, the supposed perturbation of male birds receiving less food due to extreme heat would most likely have a considerable negative effect on the second effect mentioned, that females will not hatch more chicks. This occurs as a result of a chain of consequences exerted by the decreased food availability for male birds, including diminished reproductive behaviors, reduced overall health and survival rates, and potential indirect impacts on female birds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The company is pushing out an update Wednesday that makes its much-talked-about timeline redesign official. The new feature will show tweets that are sorted based on relevancy, rather than only chronology, at the top of your timeline.      Twitter said the changes would arrive on Wednesday, but most users are still waiting to see them.      While this is a significant update for Twitter, it's by no means the end of the reverse-chronological timeline, which has been one of the service's signature features, despite the fears of vocal users.      Image: Mashable Composite      The change is strictly opt-in — at least for now. As of today, you won't see the feature unless you manually activate it in your account settings. This will, however, change at some point in the next few weeks. After the feature has been out in the wild long enough for people to get used to it, the company will switch it on for everyone — though users will still be able to opt out through their settings.      What does this look like?      The change will look very similar to the previous tests we've seen (which are now over). If you have \\"Show me the best tweets first\\" enabled, you may see a chunk of non-chronological tweets (as many as a dozen) at the top of your timeline each time you open the app. But, other than the timestamps, your timeline itself won't look much different and refreshing your timeline will revert back to chronological order, though the \\"best tweets will still appear.      Exactly how many tweets appear in the groups of \\"best\\" tweets will vary from user to user, though it will likely be based on the number of people you follow. Twitter hasn't officially said what factors it takes into account in determining which tweets \\"you’re most likely to care about,\\" though senior engineering manager Mike Jahr noted in Wednesday's announcement that they are meant to represent the \\"most important tweets from the people you follow.\\" (Update: Twitter provides a vague description over on its ads blog: \\"We look at accounts they interact with, Tweets they usually engage with, interests, and what’s going on in their network.\\")      If this sounds similar to \\"While you were away,\\" a separate feature that aims to recap tweets you may have missed in between sessions, that's because it is. But despite their similarities, \\"While you were away,\\" which Twitter launched over a year ago, isn't going anywhere.      This is how you can activate Twitter's new Home timeline feature once it rolls out to all users (via Twitter) pic.twitter.com/i1afPh04pZ — Brian Ries (@moneyries) February 10, 2016      Importantly, there is a (somewhat murky) distinction: \\"While you were away,\\" is still reserved to recap tweets when you've gone significant stretches of time between browsing sessions and may not always appear at the very top of your timeline. The new \\"best tweets first\\" feature, however, will always appear at the top each time you open the app or website. That's because it still prioritizes the most recent tweets, so the tweets that appear at the top will still be among the most recent for your timeline (rather than a sampling from the last few hours).      What's next      If there's a truism for social media companies, it's that they're never done experimenting, no matter how many people complain. Just as Facebook continues to tweak its News Feed, Twitter will likely continue to make adjustments to users' timelines. The extent to which it changes things, though, will likely depend — at least in part — on how users (and investors) respond.      The move couldn't come at a more critical time for Twitter. The company's stock has been spiraling down to new lows for weeks, as Wall Street cools on a number of once-hyped Silicon Valley darlings.      That the company would unveil the long-rumored feature one day after releasing a new ad product that allows advertisers to buy placement at the top of timelines (and hours before it reports earnings) is hardly a coincidence. Whether a few algorithmically curated tweets is enough to move the needle is another matter. Marketers, at least, appear to be cautiously optimistic, even as the rest of Twitter seems to predict its imminent demise.      While only it's too soon to tell which camp will be right, one thing is certain: Twitter can now tell you who said it best.

They tweeted using the #RIPTwitter hashtag to express disapproval, causing it to become the top Twitter trend only a few hours after the rumor emerged.      Algorithmic Timeline Rumored To Come      Friday evening, Buzzfeed broke the unconfirmed news that next week, Twitter intends to introduce an “algorithmic” timeline, one where tweets aren’t ordered by the regular first-in, last-out chronological fashion but instead where an algorithm decides what to display.      You know, like Facebook.      Twitter hasn’t commented to confirm or deny this, to BuzzFeed or any other publication that I’ve seen, including Marketing Land. We received a “no comment” when asking about it. But there’s every reason to expect it could be true, especially given that Twitter began testing this last December.      New Timeline Likely To Be Optional      There’s also every reason to believe that this will also be an optional choice for users. That’s what Josh Sternberg, a former reporter and now director of branded content for NBC News, tweeted:      Sources at Twitter tell me algorithms are strictly opt in. — Josh Sternberg (@joshsternberg) February 6, 2016      It also makes sense given that changing the default timeline to an algorithmic one would be a huge gamble, a risk of upsetting Twitter’s millions of existing users. Some might like it, but others might not.      Postscript (2:00 p.m. ET): Major Twitter investor Chris Sacca also sees it unlikely that the live timeline will disappear:      There is a 0% chance Twitter eliminates the chronological feed. — Chris Sacca (@sacca) February 6, 2016      Concern Over Changes Fuels #RIPTwitter      Certainly judging from the trending hashtag, many don’t even like the idea of it. Here are just a few examples:      Yo Twitter, what's this about an algorithmic feed? We love you just the way you are! #Don'tChange #RIPTwitter — Diana Penty (@DianaPenty) February 6, 2016      I hate Facebook. I don't use Facebook.

One of the great rewards of being an adult is deciding ON YOUR OWN who (and what) you should be interested in. #RIPTwitter — Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) February 6, 2016      Actor William Shatner and “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda are among other celebrities who are not happy. See our related story: Celebrities Tweeting #RIPTwitter Against Twitter Timeline Change.      There’s plenty of fear that Twitter will turn into Facebook, which is clearly not what many using Twitter want. Reassurances that this might just be an option may not resonate with some.      There are plenty expressing concern about how the change from favorites and stars to likes and hearts was forced upon them. Others are concerned that longer, perhaps 10,000-character tweets, might come and change the service.      There’s also any number of people who are frustrated that with all the activity Twitter has been doing to push new products and features, it still hasn’t done the one thing many are pleading for: allow tweets to be edited after posting.      Why’s Twitter Thinking About This?      There’s a good reason why Twitter might want to add an algorithmic timeline to its service. That’s because it can be useful. There is indeed a lot of “noise” that can drown out the “signal” on the service, where it can be hard to find popular or interesting tweets if you’re just browsing for general entertainment.      In particular, there’s a strong sense in some quarters — not necessarily true — that Twitter isn’t helpful or friendly to new users, plus a thought that existing users might not engage as much because there’s so much noise.      In turn, this has investors in particular worried about Twitter, which puts pressure on Twitter to look at ways to change. That pressure isn’t going to disappear. Unfortunately, Twitter will constantly be compared to Facebook in terms of financial performance and expectations, even though the two services are fundamentally different.      Facebook is a huge social platform that has multiple brands and serves multiple needs. Twitter remains largely what Twitter has always been, a social media outlet where people talk directly to each other about others and about things in general.      Clearing Up Some Myths & Confusion      As said, it’s unlikely that Twitter will change the default timeline in the short term. Anyone assuming that really should relax. Even in the longer term, this seems unlikely. Certainly, it would be an incredibly stupid move.      As I’ve written before, Twitter is like live TV to Facebook’s DVR-style of social media. Twitter is the place where people all over the world have live conversations with each other. It’s where they watch in amazement as celebrities converse with each other (or fight with each other).      These conversations are the deep, rich content that Facebook only wishes it had, to the degree that last week, Facebook came under fire for obscuring the fact that Twitter was the source of things that eventually trended on Facebook. It seems unlikely that Twitter’s leadership would wreck its crown jewel, the conversations that only come about because of a live stream. Rather, adding in an algorithmic timeline as an option could be a good complement to that.      A related concern is from those who fear an algorithmic stream means they wouldn’t see everything from the accounts they follow, similar to the way Facebook filters things. The idea is that Twitter shows everything. The reality is that Twitter’s current timeline does not.      Yes, Twitter will show you everything from those you follow. But you only see all of that when you’re actually on Twitter — and no one watches Twitter 24 hours per day. There are things missed when you’re away, tweets you might actually want to see. A “DVR” version of Twitter as an option would be a nice way of providing this in addition to the live stream that people value.      There’s also a mistaken assumption that by making such a change, Twitter would only show people stuff that advertisers have paid for. Twitter already does this in the live stream and has done so for ages. That’s called Promoted Tweets. In short, Twitter doesn’t need an algorithm timeline to insert ads. It can and does already do that with the existing live one.      Swipe Right, Swipe Left: Solving Twitter’s Discovery Problem?      Overall, done right and as an option, introducing an algorithmic timeline could be useful for those who want to see a “best of Twitter” view for the accounts they follow. It could also be useful for new people as a way to help them feel there’s great content on Twitter, if that’s an issue.      The real challenge is whether people will use it. Twitter already has its Moments button, but its unclear how much that’s used. Would this be yet another thing that people might toggle to?      Personally, I’d love to see Twitter adopt a more “swipe” approach to its app that I’m used to with Snapchat. Put my usual live timeline on my main screen. Let me swipe right to see the algorithmic “best of” personal timeline. Let me swipe again to see only images and photos from those I follow, giving me a sort of “Twittergram” take. Let me swipe further right to tap into more personal stuff, my likes, my messages and so on.      To the left, let me discover things. Most important, let me swipe left to see what’s trending on Twitter. It’s terrible that the conversations that people are obsessed with remain hidden in the mobile app and only revealed if you click on search. Provide trends with their own screen. Let me swipe left again to reach Moments.      I’m not saying these are a cure for Twitter’s woes. Actually, I don’t think Twitter is really that broken. I think there are things it can do to improve. But Twitter’s biggest problem really is investors that want to turn it into Facebook in terms of revenue. That leads to the biggest concern its users may have: that they don’t want the unique service they love fundamentally becoming more Facebook-like in the quest for that revenue.

It’s chill.            The new timeline shows you a series of tweets from people you follow before it shows you the real-time stream of tweets. How exactly it determines the mix isn’t clear but you can be sure it involves—wait for it!—an algorithm. It’s an opt-in feature that has to be switched on in your settings. In the blog post announcing the change, the company is very carful not to alarm sensitive users:      Here’s how it works. You flip on the feature in your settings; then when you open Twitter after being away for a while, the Tweets you’re most likely to care about will appear at the top of your timeline – still recent and in reverse chronological order. The rest of the Tweets will be displayed right underneath, also in reverse chronological order, as always. At any point, just pull-to-refresh to see all new Tweets at the top in the live, up-to-the-second experience you already know and love.      Advertisement      Don’t worry everybody! It’s not that different! If you don’t like it, you don’t have to use it (for now), and even if you do use it, it’s easy to get rid of (for now).      We should note that Twitter’s had a feature like this for some time—showing you popular tweets from people you follow when you open up the app. It’s not totally clear how this is different, but since Twitter is announcing it, it must be substantively so.      A shitstorm erupted last weekend following reports that Twitter was planning on algorithmically reordering timelines a la Facebook. Company CEO Jack Dorsey quickly quashed the rumors that Twitter had any plans to reorder timelines—a least this week. Depending how you read this news, you might see him as a big liar.      Advertisement      Twitter’s in trouble. It’s not making a lot of money, and it’s not growing very fast, which are both bad news if you care about stock prices and all. We’ll know just how much when the company reports earnings today. But you can expect more change is coming to the beloved bird soon.      [Twitter]      Contact the author at maguilar@gizmodo.com. ||||| Today, Twitter rolled out arguably the most fundamental change it has ever made: a major tweak to the timeline. If you already use Twitter, you probably knew this was coming—#RIPTwitter and the Super Bowl were about the only things people talked about on the network this weekend. If you don't already use Twitter, well, Twitter hopes this might make you start. Either way, the feature's meant to dramatically increase the number of tweets you see that you actually care about.      Twitter's own customer research found out there was a lot of FOMO going on. Everyone felt like they were missing all the good tweets. \\"We wanted to change that feeling of missing out,\\" says product manager Twitter product manager Michelle Haq, \\"which is why we decided to go after that problem.\\"      Here's what's new—and before you freak out, know that this is not all bad and it's not the giant, Facebook-inspired overhaul you think it is. When you open Twitter after being away from Twitter for a bit, the first tweets at the top of your timeline won't necessarily be the latest ones. They'll be the tweets the service's algorithm determines most relevant to you, based on a variety of factors. Rather than show you the tweets from 10 seconds before you opened the app, it will now attempt to catch you up on the most important #content since you left.      In most ways this is no different from the existing \\"While You Were Away\\" feature, except it won't be highlighted in any way. There's no limit to how many tweets will be out of order at the top, but Haq says the average is about a dozen. As for how often the catch-up feature will trigger? \\"This is going to vary by user,\\" Haq says. If you follow 1,000 accounts, and I follow 20 accounts... it might happen for you more often than it happens for me.\\"      The new timeline's available for everyone today, but it's not turned on by default—yet. At some point in the next few weeks (the new feature's rolling out in waves), you'll get a pop-up notification in Twitter for Android, iOS, and web that says \\"Never miss an important tweet,\\" followed by some explanation about the new way your timeline is organized. From then on, your timeline will be presented the new, algorithmic way. Don't like it? Turn it off in settings.      It's a rather simple update, though in fairness to detractors, it's yet other move away from what makes Twitter, Twitter. Initially, you might be slightly confused by the jumpy timestamps in your timeline, but as long as you pay a little attention you shouldn't get too lost. In the best-case scenario, the new timeline will serve up a greatest-hits compilation every time you open the app. No matter how much of a power a user you are, you're missing tweets—wouldn't it be nice to know you never missed a good one? In the worst case, it's a feckless mishmash of inanity, self-promotion, and lightly veiled #brandengagement. The truth will probably lie somewhere in the middle, and improve over time. Twitter has every incentive to make sure you're actually seeing good tweets and not just thirsty Taco Bell jokes. (Though that's half the reason Twitter's any fun.)      The folks who are up in arms about the new feature are, broadly speaking, worried about what happens if your entire timeline becomes algorithmically powered the way Facebook is. In that world, you wouldn't and couldn't see every tweet; you'd never know why you were seeing what you were seeing, or if there were other, better things hidden from you. Facebook asks you to trust its ability to surface everything you want and need; Twitter's been a more understandable haven. It's certainly possible (though exceedingly unlikely) that Twitter could switch to a fully algorithmic timeline in the future, but this is not that.      It will feel weird for a few days as you get used to the idea of Twitter as something other than a raw, unedited feed. But give it a few days, and it'll almost certainly feel like Twitter again. Just a little more useful now—at least, that's what Twitter's hoping. ||||| As expected, Twitter is tweaking its timeline to show users the best tweets from people they follow.      But before you freak out, know that the algorithmic timeline is optional. If you activate it, the entries Twitter thinks you're most likely to care about will appear at the top of the timeline—still in reverse chronological order. The tweets Twitter deems less important will be displayed underneath, also in reverse chronological order. Just pull to refresh and new messages will appear at the top of your live feed. If you don't like it, revisit Settings to turn it off.      \\"We've already seen that people who use this new feature tend to retweet and tweet more, creating more live commentary and conversations, which is great for everyone,\\" senior engineering manager Mike Jahr wrote in a blog post.      Don't fret if you don't see the option just yet; Twitter's slow rollout will continue over the coming weeks. Users can expect a notification in their timeline once the function is available. But if you miss it, Twitter's support page has instructions for activating it on Twitter.com, iOS, and Android.      Twitter tested a similar formula last year when it added a \\"While you were away\\" section to the top of timelines, highlighting a few of the best tweets that may have otherwise gone unnoticed.      With this new system, though, it remains unclear how the social network will evaluate content and float the more compelling bits to the top. Will it be based on hearts and retweets? Interactions with other Twitter users?      Rumors about an updated Twitter timeline emerged last week, and many users were not happy with the decision, resulting in the #RIPTwitter hashtag. ||||| Twitter has finally lifted the curtain on its long-teased rejig of the timeline.      A new feature, dubbed “show me the best Tweets first”, will mix-up the Twitter timeline for the first time ever, putting the “most important” tweets from people you follow at the top of the timeline.      The rest of the feed remains as normal, and scrolling to the top loads in tweets chronologically, as before.      It’s a minor change, similar to the “While you were away” feature pushed out to users in the past year. But it is sure to prove controversial regardless.      Initially, users will be able to opt-in to the feature, but eventually Twitter confirms that it will push it to everyone as the default setting.      But don’t worry: you will still be able to turn it off. The company has provided instructions for how do so on its help pages. You can’t follow them pre-emptively, so bookmark this page for when the feature is rolled out to your phone, just in case the new feature isn’t to your taste. ||||| You follow hundreds of people on Twitter — maybe thousands — and when you open Twitter, it can feel like you’ve missed some of their most important Tweets. Today, we’re excited to share a new timeline feature that helps you catch up on the best Tweets from people you follow.      Here’s how it works. You flip on the feature in your settings; then when you open Twitter after being away for a while, the Tweets you’re most likely to care about will appear at the top of your timeline – still recent and in reverse chronological order. The rest of the Tweets will be displayed right underneath, also in reverse chronological order, as always. At any point, just pull-to-refresh to see all new Tweets at the top in the live, up-to-the-second experience you already know and love.      We’ve already seen that people who use this new feature tend to Retweet and Tweet more, creating more live commentary and conversations, which is great for everyone. To check it out now, just go into the timeline section of your settings and choose ‘Show me the best Tweets first’. We’ll be listening to your feedback and making it even better over time. Then we’ll be turning on the feature for you in coming weeks — look out for a notification in your timeline. We love it and think you will too. If you don’t, send your thoughts our way, and you can easily turn it off in settings.      Android settings      iOS settings      We think this is a great way to get even more out of Twitter and we’re excited for you to experience it. Let us know what you think! ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Twitter introduced an optional algorithmic timeline this week to help users catch up on the best tweets from people they follow.

Lindsey Caroline Vonn (nee Kildow ; born October 18, 1984) is an American World Cup alpine ski racer on the US Ski Team. She has won four World Cup overall championships--one of only two female skiers to do so, along with Annemarie Moser-Proll--with three consecutive titles in 2008, 2009, and 2010, plus another in 2012. Vonn won the gold medal in downhill at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the first ever in the event for an American woman. She has also won a record 8 World Cup season titles in the downhill discipline (2008-2013, 2015, 2016), 5 titles in super-G (2009-2012, 2015), and 3 consecutive titles in the combined (2010-2012). At the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010, Vonn planned to compete in all five women's alpine events. On February 10, she revealed she had severely bruised her shin in training the previous week. Vonn said the pain from her injury was \\"excruciating\\" and she would have a difficult time competing at the Winter Olympics. Due to unseasonably warm weather and resultant poor snow conditions, many of the Alpine skiing events were moved back, giving Vonn additional time to heal. On February 17, in her first event, Vonn won the gold medal in the downhill at Whistler Blackcomb, beating longtime U.S. rival Julia Mancuso by 0.56 seconds and becoming the first American woman to win Olympic gold in downhill.  In her second event, the super combined, Vonn finished first in the downhill portion of the race. In the slalom portion, however, she crashed when she failed to get her ski around a right-hand gate. Vonn said her shin wasn't the problem. Gold and silver were won by Maria Riesch and Julia Mancuso respectively.  In her third event, the super-G, Vonn finished third behind Andrea Fischbacher and Tina Maze, 0.74 seconds behind Fischbacher's winning time. Afterwards, Vonn said she didn't ski the last part of the course as aggressively as she could have and lost the race as a result. In her fourth event, the giant slalom, fog affected visibility. Vonn crashed in her first run, resulting in a broken fourth finger and Vonn's disqualification from the event.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Joana Ortega i Alemany was born on November 13, 1959, in the vibrant city of Barcelona, Spain. She pursued her higher education at the Abat Oliba CEU University, which is a prestigious private university located in Catalonia, Spain. Joana showed great promise in her academic endeavors and was destined to make significant contributions to the political sphere in her home region. Ortega's political aspirations led her to join the Democratic Union of Catalonia – a center-right political party in the autonomous community of Catalonia. As a member of this party, she was associated with its parent organization, the Convergence and Union (CiU) – a center-right Catalan nationalist electoral coalition active in the same region. Her dedicated work in the political landscape caught the eye of the then-president of Catalonia, Artur Mas, who held office from December 29, 2010, until June 22, 2015. Recognizing her potential, Mas appointed Joana Ortega as the Vice President of Catalonia, a position in which she would not only be responsible for external relations and communication but also act as his second-in-command. Concurrently, Ortega was entrusted with another important portfolio as the Minister of Governance and Institutional Relations. As Vice President and Minister, Joana Ortega was responsible for promoting the image and interests of Catalonia both nationally and internationally. She played a crucial role in the development and implementation of public policies and was involved in the coordination of ministries while ensuring that institutional relations and governance structures in the region were functioning efficiently. Her term as Vice President and Minister of Governance and Institutional Relations ended on June 22, 2015. Joana Ortega's successors to these positions were Neus Munté i Fernández and Meritxell Borràs i Solé, respectively. Prior to her tenure as Vice President, Joana Ortega had held other significant political positions in Catalonia, including serving as the successor to both Josep-Lluís Carod-Rovira and Jordi Ausàs i Coll. Her experiences in these roles enabled her to contribute effectively to her subsequent roles in the Catalan government. Although the bullet points provide only a brief overview of the life of Joana Ortega i Alemany, they give us a picture of a strong, dedicated, and influential political figure in Catalonia. Joana Ortega's journey from her birth in Barcelona, through her education at Abat Oliba CEU University, and her rise to high-ranked political positions reflects her passion for the growth and development of the Catalan region and her commitment to its people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Living End are an Australian punk rock band, which formed in 1994. Since 2002 the line up consists of Chris Cheney (vocals, guitar), Scott Owen (double bass, vocals) and Andy Strachan (drums). The band rose to fame in 1997 after the release of their double A-sided single, \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. They have released six studio albums and two reached the No. 1 spot on the ARIA Albums Chart: self-titled album (12 October 1998) and State of Emergency (4 February 2006). The Living End were formed in 1994 by Chris Cheney and Scott Owen, who had met years earlier in primary school through their older sisters and began performing together from 1990 while attending Wheelers Hill Secondary College in Melbourne. Cheney and Owen had their first public gig at The Rob Roy in Melbourne in 1991. Cheney was a fan of rockabilly group Stray Cats and this prompted Owen, who originally played piano, to switch to double bass. The pair formed a cover band, The Runaway Boys, which performed Stray Cats and The Clash material. That group were named after a track, of the same name, from the Stray Cats self-titled debut album (February 1981). The Runaway Boys initially played in the local rockabilly music scene but expanded their audience by performing in regional towns. Cheney later recalled \\"[w]e played to all the jivers and rock 'n' rollers ... And we slowly drifted into Melbourne's rockabilly scene\\". As Cheney and Owen persevered, the band went through several drummers, while they were still attending school.  By 1994 Cheney and Owen were writing their own material and decided to change the band's name to The Living End - a reference to the film, Rock Around the Clock (1956). According to Cheney \\"It's an old '50s term, meaning 'far out', 'the greatest' ... We were still into the whole '50s thing, but we wanted a neutral name, one that didn't suggest any one style of music\\". With Cheney on lead guitar and lead vocals, and Owen on double bass and backing vocals, the group settled on Joe Piripitzi as their drummer. Cheney considered Piripitzi to be ideal due to his charismatic appearance.  During that year they recorded a track, \\"Headlines\\", which had been co-written by Cheney and Owen. The group sent a T-shirt and demo tape to Green Day guitarist and lead vocalist, Billie Joe Armstrong, and landed a support slot for the 1995 Australian tour by his band, Green Day. After that tour, The Living End recorded additional tracks for their debut extended play, Hellbound, which received moderate support from community radio stations. It was produced by the group and included \\"Headlines\\" from the previous year. Ed Nimmervoll, an Australian musicologist, described the EP's sound: \\"they turned their back on '50s rock revivalism and adapted that instrumentation to original songs steeped in UK punk\\".  In November 1995, the trio recorded their second EP, It's for Your Own Good, which appeared in the following June. The six-track EP was co-produced by Lindsay Gravina (Underground Lovers, Cosmic Psychos), Mike Alonso (Jericho) and The Living End for the Rapido label. It included their first radio airplay hit, \\"From Here on In\\", which was placed on high rotation by national youth radio network, Triple J. Shortly after, Piripitzi was fired as his lifestyle choices were holding back the band. He was replaced on drums by Travis Demsey (later in The Knockout Drops). With Demsey the group appeared at major festivals: Pushover and the Falls Festival. Demsey's drum style was compared with The Who's Keith Moon. \\"From Here on In\\" was used on the soundtrack for the 1998 film, Occasional Course Language.  The Living End toured Australia for a year, then in August 1997 they recorded new material to sell at their live shows. Their double A-sided single, \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\", was issued in January the following year. Also that month they had supported The Offspring on the Australian leg of their tour. \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\" peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and was certified double-platinum by ARIA for shipment of 140,000 copies. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 it won the Highest Selling Single category; and eventually became the highest selling Australian single of the 1990s. It lasted a record-breaking 47 weeks in the Top 50.  In October 1998 it peaked at No. 28 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It was later featured in the game, Guitar Hero World Tour. \\"Second Solution\\" was used in the soundtrack for the 2002 movie, Cheats, which starred Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, and Mary Tyler Moore. Early in 1998 \\"Prisoner of Society\\" was issued as a separate single in the United Kingdom and, the following year, in the US. The single appeared in the top 200 of the UK Singles Chart, and peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard's Alternative Songs Chart.  The band signed with Modular Recordings for the release of their debut self-titled album, which appeared on 12 October 1998, and was co-produced by Gravina with the trio. It peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, became the then-second highest-selling debut rock album in Australian music history and, by 1999, was certified 4x Platinum for shipment of 280,000 units. Their next Australian single, \\"Save the Day\\", was issued in September 1998, a month ahead of the album. It made the top 30 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It became their highest charting hit on the New Zealand Singles Chart, where it reached No. 10. From the album, a total of six singles were released including a live cover version of \\"Tainted Love\\", which was issued as a radio-only single on Triple J. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999, The Living End won two more awards: Best Group and Breakthrough Artist - Album. At the ceremony they were also nominated for Album of the Year and Highest Selling Album. In October 2010 their debut album was listed in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums.  The Living End's second album, Roll On, was recorded during July 2000 with Nick Launay (Midnight Oil, Models, Silverchair) producing and appeared in November that year. It peaked at No. 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart and reached the top 40 in New Zealand. Although Roll On was a more creative work, Nimmervoll mentioned that they had \\"broadened their musical scope while keeping in tact what made them unique - the instrumentation and the socially-aware lyrics\\". The album did not achieve the status of their earlier album as it was certified platinum for shipment of 70,000 copies. Despite this, fans consider it to be as strong as the self-titled album; \\"[it's] an absolute scorcher! That's what years of live honing can do for a band that was already white-hot\\".  Cheney later stated that he was trying to prove to critics that The Living End were not a band simply defined by their hit, \\"Prisoner of Society\\", and the album showed this by displaying other influences, as well as their traditional fast-paced rockabilly music. Rolling Stone' Jenny Eiscu compared it to The Clash's creative breakthrough, London Calling (December 1979), as they \\"stomp all over the boundaries between punk, reggae, rockabilly and plain old rock & roll - and it still sounds like a revelation, twenty-two years after [T]he Clash did it. The pupils don't quite outpace the masters here ... But the band is obviously having such a riotously good time that you'd be a sucker not to stomp your foot and join the party\\". Much of the style was comparable to 1980s hard rock and pub rock, as well as many tracks being obscure mixes of many ideas, resulting in 'procrastinating' structures. This defined the album's creativity.

We see several signs: \\"Clark Gable Beware!,\\" then a trumpet player improvises; \\"Kay Francis Here He Comes!,\\" then a saxophone player plays; \\"Leslie Howard Watch Your Step!,\\" then a trombone player plays a lick; \\"Garbo I Tank You Like Him!,\\" then a string bass player slaps his bass; \\"Olivia de Havilland Your Midsummer Nights Dream Is On His Way!,\\" and then Benny Goodman (himself) improvises on his clarinet (all instrumentalists are members of Goodman's band). The camera reveals that each of these instrumentalists and many other members of the band are in a motorcade, with each person in a different car with a different sign plastered on the front of each car. They are parading, under police escort, to the St. Louis Airport. Once they arrive, they continue the song with Georgia (Johnnie Scat Davis) and Alice (Frances Langford) singing the lyrics; then, the band members also sing. The band is seeing one of its saxophone players, Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell), off to Hollywood; he has signed a ten-week movie contract with Miracle Pictures; the studio's motto is: \\"Miracle Pictures Studio, If Its a Good Picture, Its a Miracle.\\" As his plane taxies away from the loading area, the band launches into \\"California, Here I Come.\\" The next sequence is a montage of various Hollywood sights as \\"Hooray for Hollywood\\" plays in the background.

Considered the \\"father of the computer\\", he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later.

Pacino feels like a bankable source to disguise mediocrity but a dud is a dud and Avnet is wholly indifferent 3. At times it's almost like Pacino has been lured into a Bobby Bowfinger production except the best blackmail material around to get his permission for release is 88 Minutes itself. 4. The only mystery here is why Pacino would have chosen to lend his talents to a project of an artistic level that most people would more readily associate with the likes of Michael Pare about ten years ago or Robert De Niro today. 5. If only the film actually ran 88 minutes instead of 108, the many glaring logic loopholes might have whizzed by without notice. But like a bad apple, that extra 20 minutes of wasted film has rotted the rest. 6. A skilled director could take the same exact script from 88 Minutes, change maybe three or four lines, and shoot it as a spoof movie. It's that close to self-parody. 7. While the actual ending does give audiences a reason to cheer, it's the final fade out that will make viewers the happiest. It means this tepid terror is finally over. 8. ...it is mildly entertaining to see Pacino in a role where he has obviously been encouraged to turn it up, to become a wild-eyed, roaring self-parody 9. Even a viewer with incredibly low expectations will be staggered by its badness. 10. 88 Minutes is a guilty pleasure, which shouldn't be confused with serious moviemaking.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A policeman fatally shot a Christian man and wounded five other Christians Tuesday in an attack on a train in Egypt, officials said. The incident occurred at about 5 p.m. when a man walked onto the train, which was stopped in the station at Samalut, about 200 kilometers south of Cairo, said Maryanne Nabil Thaki, 29, one of the victims. She said she was seated with her sister, Maggie Nabil Thaki, 25, their 52-year-old mother, Sabah Sinot Suleiman, and Maggie's fiance, 26-year-old Ehab Ashraf Kamal. They were en route to Cairo to buy an engagement ring, Maggie Thaki said. Seated near them was an older Christian couple, Maryanne Nabil Thaki said. The gunman walked up and down the length of the train, then walked back to two groups of people who were seated near each other and were both Coptic Christians, she told a reporter at the Good Shepherd Hospital in Samalut, where she was being treated for gunshot wounds to the leg and the chest. The man said in Arabic, \\"There is no God but God,\\" and opened fire, she said. The shooter fled the train, but was captured later, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said. The suspect, a deputy policeman, was identified as Amer Ashoor Abdel-Zaher Hassan. He boarded the train in Asiut and was en route to Bani Mazar, Menya province, where he works. The older man, Fathi Saeed Ebaid, 71, of Cairo, was killed, a local security source told the state-run Egyptian news agency MENA. His wife, Emily Hannah Tedly, 61, was in critical condition, as was the mother of the two younger women, said Dr. Petra Kamal. All five were to be flown to Cairo for further treatment, a hospital employee said. In front of the hospital, about a dozen Copts demonstrated in support of the victims but were dispersed by police who fired a tear gas canister that broke through a fifth-floor hospital window, said hospital employee Mina Farouk. The attack comes 10 days after a bombing killed 23 Coptic Christians outside the Church of the Two Saints in Alexandria, Egypt, an attack that unnerved Christians and led to increased security. Relations between the Christian minority and Muslim majority within Egypt have been tense since that New Year's Day bombing. Those troubles were evident last Friday -- the day Coptic Christians, who follow the Julian calendar, celebrate Christmas -- when police staged a large-scale security operation outside the same church. In a show of solidarity, some Egyptian Muslims attended the Christmas services. Still, protests have erupted almost nightly in many Christian areas of Egypt since the bombing. Egyptian authorities have released a sketch of a man they think was the suicide bomber in the church attack. The Interior Ministry used forensic technology to re-create the face. About 9 percent of Egypt's 80 million residents are Coptic Christians. They base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity. The religion is known for its rift with other Christians in the fifth century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Housam Ahmed and Amir Ahmed and Journalist Ian Lee contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A bad thing happened in Egypt on a train. A policeman hurt some people who are called Christians. The people were just sitting in the train and talking, but the policeman came and used a gun to hurt them. One person died, and others got very hurt. The policeman later got caught by other policemen. This happened because sometimes people in Egypt don't get along because they have different beliefs. So now, people are very worried and want everyone to be safe and kind to each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Director Stutz questions his family about his mother's suicide in 1979 and how little they've actually discussed it, visiting his mother's grave site with his sister and listening to old tapes of their mother. He talks to several survivors and experts before commissioning several artists to come up with works about suicide: A band (The Bigfellas) agrees to make a song about suicide \\"that you can dance to\\"; an illustrator (Patrick Horvath) is to make short animated films (which run through the documentary as interstitials); a choreographer (Danielle Peig) chooses to create a dance piece based on two autopsy reports; and a standup comedian (Duncan Trussell) compiles material for his act about suicide with the help of several top comedy writers. Meanwhile, Stutz continues to interview and engage his family about his mother's death, eventually staging his mother's suicide (where he discovered her unconscious at the age of 12) on screen with members of the \\"avant-garde circus\\" troupe, The Lucent Dossier Experience. As some of the interviews take a turn from the dark to the more cathartic, the tone of the movie brightens at the end during the performances of the artistic material.

In fact, they move much more quickly than they should according to their size and the laws of physics. Scientists do not completely understand why the speed of these stars is so high. But many believe the reason is that much of the universe is made of something called \\"dark matter\\". Groups of stars called galaxies, such as the Milky Way, might even be made up of 90 percent dark matter. How much something weighs depends on where it is. The same object weighs only half as much on Mars as it does on Earth and almost three times as much on Jupiter. So scientists prefer to talk about the mass   of something rather than how much it weighs, because mass does not change. They can work out the mass of galaxies by measuring the distance between them and the speed they move at. Recently, Jorge Penarrubia, a senior academic at Edinburgh University, UK, and his team discovered something interesting: The mass of the Milky Way is only half as much as the mass of another nearby galaxy, Andromeda. This seems strange, and dark matter may explain why. Finding out more about dark matter could help us understand how the universe began, but this is not easy. Lots of scientists with different types of expert knowledge are working on the problem. We can't see dark matter, it's very difficult to measure and we can't find out its mass. Unlike stars, dark matter doesn't produce or reflect light. But we can make a good guess that it is there because of the way things move and the way light bends.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the artist who's greatest hits album did the lead singer of the band that tried to \\"remain somewhat grungy\\" give to the man that added layers of guitars to songs? from the following article ?  Recording sessions for the album began on October 31, 1988, at Downtown Recorders in Boston, Massachusetts, at the time a professional 24-track studio. 4AD allowed the Pixies a budget of 40,000, excluding producer's fees. This was a modest sum for a 1980s major label album; however, it quadrupled the amount spent on the band's previous album, Surfer Rosa. Along with Norton, two assistant recording engineers and two second assistants were assigned to the project. The sessions lasted three weeks, concluding on November 23, with \\"nearly a song a day\\" being recorded.Production and mixing began on November 28. The band relocated to Carriage House Studios, a residential studio in Stamford, Connecticut, to oversee production and record further tracks. Norton recruited Steve Haigler as mixing engineer, whom he had worked with at Fort Apache Studios. During production, Haigler and Norton added layers of guitars and vocals to songs, including overdubbed guitars on \\"Debaser\\" and double tracking vocals on \\"Wave of Mutilation\\". During the recordings, Norton advised Francis to alter several songs; a noted example being \\"There Goes My Gun\\" which was originally intended as a much faster Hüsker Dü-style song. However, at Norton's advice, Francis slowed down the tempo.Norton's suggestions were not always welcome, and several instances of advice to add verses and increase track length contributed to the front man's building frustration. Eventually, Francis took Norton to a record store, where he handed him a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits, in which most of the songs are about two minutes long. He told Norton, \\"If it's good enough for Buddy Holly ...\\" In a  Rolling Stone interview, Francis later recalled that \\"this record is him trying to make us, shall I say, commercial, and us trying to remain somewhat grungy\\". Production continued until December 12, 1988, with Norton and Haigler adding extra effects, including gated reverb to the mix. The master tapes were then sent for final post-production later that month.","output":"The full name of the artist whose greatest hits album was given by the lead singer of the band (the Pixies) that tried to \\"remain somewhat grungy\\" to the man (producer Gary Norton) who added layers of guitars to songs is Charles Hardin Holley, better known as Buddy Holly. The lead singer of the Pixies, Black Francis (real name Charles Thompson), handed Norton a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits as an example of how a song can be good and impactful without being overly long or commercialized. The Pixies were trying to maintain their signature grungy sound during the recording of their album, and Francis used Buddy Holly as an inspiration and proof that it was possible to create meaningful music without excessive commercialization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to once in a blue moon origin of phrase??","output":"The phrase \\"once in a blue moon\\" refers to an event or occurrence that is extremely rare. The idiom originates from the astronomical phenomenon of a \\"blue moon.\\" Before delving into the origin and history of the expression, it is essential to understand the meaning and significance behind a blue moon itself. The term \\"blue moon\\" is used to describe the second full moon that takes place within a single calendar month. To be clear, the moon does not actually turn blue. The color blue has no scientific connection to the event, and the term is simply a metaphor. It would typically require extraordinarily rare conditions, such as the presence of volcanic ash or large forest fires, for the moon to appear blue. Interestingly, there are other occasions when the term is used for different moon-related phenomena; however, the phrase \\"once in a blue moon\\" is etymologically tied to the aforementioned phenomenon of having two full moons in a single month. Full moons usually occur nearly every 29.5 days, which is approximately the length of one lunar cycle. Given that most months in the Gregorian calendar have 30 or 31 days, the possibility of witnessing two full moons in a single month arises occasionally. This phenomenon only happens, on average, once every 2.7 years, thus making it an infrequent event and leading to the birth of the expression \\"once in a blue moon.\\" The history of the phrase can be traced back to English literature from the 16th century. The first known recorded use of the term \\"blue moon\\" appeared in a pamphlet from 1528, titled \\"Rede Me and Be Not Wrothe,\\" authored by William Roy and Jeremy Barlowe. In this early usage, the term was not employed to describe an astronomical event but instead to exemplify the absurdity – akin to saying, \\"when pigs fly.\\" However, it is important to note that the connection between these early instances and the current idiomatic meaning is quite weak and not well-documented. The phrase continued to evolve, and by the 19th century, it began to gain momentum and solidify its connection to rare lunar phenomena. In 1821, an article in The London Literary Gazette used the phrase to describe a rare event. The term became increasingly popular over time and established its correlation with the infrequent occurrence of two full moons within a single calendar month. In more recent times, a publication called Sky & Telescope played a pivotal role in popularizing the phrase, albeit unintentionally. In an article from 1946, the author, James Hugh Pruett, misunderstood a definition within the 1937 edition of the Maine Farmers' Almanac. Pruett's misinterpretation led to the introduction of the \\"Blue Moon Rule,\\" equating a blue moon to the second full moon within a single month. This article ultimately helped cement and propagate the modern understanding of a blue moon and subsequently, the origin of the phrase \\"once in a blue moon.\\" In summary, the idiom \\"once in a blue moon\\" signifies an event that happens very rarely. The expression has historical ties to rare lunar events and evolved over time, particularly due to a 1946 article that popularized Pruett's \\"Blue Moon Rule.\\" Today, the term is used to describe any exceedingly uncommon occurrence or special event that only happens every few years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You'll come out ahead money-wise and have a much better meal than you can find on Las Vegas Boulevard.   It's a lively little tapas restaurant, dark and packed on a Saturday night, far too cool for its strip mall location. But then again, it's Vegas, and nearly everything's in a strip mall.   We got a table for two after about a 20-minute wait and the service was great and glitchless from start to finish.   Every last thing we ordered was interesting and amazing. Not a plate was left with a crumb. We had: a warm spinach salad with grilled peppers; a beet salad with goat cheese and candied pecans; fried red potatoes with homemade aioli; grilled diablo shrimp with a spicy, sweet sauce and garlic bread; calamari; and bacon-wrapped almond-stuffed dates.

A retired diplomat, played nicely by Michael York, goes to Russia to get revenge on the Russian gangster that murdered the diplomat's policeman son. There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian cop who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice. I remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the Russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous U.S. government. It's interesting to see this time the Russian guy as a hero. Not a great flick, it's really typically a \\"B\\" action flick. Michael York lends some class to this mediocre movie. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop is kind of \\"blah\\" but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Face it, Michael York is such a good actor that he'd have chemistry with anyone he's doing a scene with. Disappointingly, the handsome Adrian Paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie. Now, if Adrian Paul was in this movie longer, it would've been an above average \\"B\\" action flick. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he is real nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is your typical bad guy.

At a forum for young people, Mrs Merkel tells the Palestinian girl, Reem, that not all migrants can stay in Germany and \\"some will have to go home\\". Mrs Merkel then strokes Reem, who is now crying, on the back. Reem had said she and her family had been waiting four years to gain permanent residency in Germany. Within hours of the video being broadcast, the term #Merkelstreichelt (Merkel strokes) trended on Twitter. Some social media users complained that Mrs Merkel had \\"petted\\" the girl and failed to show enough sensitivity, although others defended the leader's reaction. In the video, Reem tells Mrs Merkel that her family was told they would have to return to a camp in Lebanon imminently - only to receive a last-minute temporary German residency permit. \\"I would like to go to university,\\" says Reem, in fluent German. \\"It's really very hard to watch how other people can enjoy life and you yourself can't.

Please write a short summary for the following article: King’s Absence at Meeting Signals a Saudi-U.S. Marriage Adrift For Mr. Obama, a diplomatic agreement with Iran curbing its nuclear program offers the strongest chance of keeping conflict in the region from escalating. For the Sunni-led Saudi government, the relaxation of sanctions in the proposed deal would simply give Iran, a predominantly Shiite state, billions of dollars to foment more instability around the region. While the Americans and the Saudis are now cooperating to fight the Islamic State, Riyadh wants more action to force out the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, while Mr. Obama has been reluctant to intervene. Similarly, while Mr. Obama has portrayed the drive for greater democracy in the region as a force for good, the Saudis see the still simmering Arab Spring movement as a threat to their hold on power. In the midst of all that, the politics of energy have shifted along with the surge in oil production in North Dakota and Texas. No longer so dependent on foreign crude, the United States can flex muscles without worrying about the Saudis cutting its energy supply. Yet Washington still relies on Riyadh to keep the price of oil low to pressure Russia’s energy-based economy in the standoff over Ukraine. Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama, said that differences were to be expected between two countries with varied interests but that those did not undermine the broader relationship. “We have a very robust agenda that we share with the Saudis,” he said. “There have been disagreements under this administration and under the previous administration about certain policies and development in the Middle East, but I think on a set of core interests, we continue to have a common view about what we aim to achieve.” But experts said the United States had little desire to be drawn more deeply into the dangerous proxy war between Iran and the Sunni states playing out in places like Yemen. “The United States is not interested in overindulging in other issues that the gulf states are worried about,” said Marwan Muasher, a Jordanian former foreign minister. “Are the gulf states going to go back from this meeting feeling reassured? I would say the answer is no.” Presidents have labored to stay close to Saudi Arabia for decades, but have sometimes run into turbulence. Ronald Reagan sold the Saudis sophisticated Awacs airplanes over the objections of Israel. George Bush sent 500,000 troops to defend Saudi Arabia and reverse Iraq’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait. His son George W. Bush shared plans in advance with eager Saudis for his own invasion of Iraq. But King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, who died in January, was once so upset with the younger Mr. Bush about his support for Israel that the king threatened to storm out of a visit to the president’s Texas ranch. The Saudis also frustrated Mr. Bush by refusing to work closely with the Shiite-led Iraqi government as it fought Sunni insurgents. Over the years, administrations have worried about Saudi money that has financed extremist groups. Mr. Obama, who ripped up his schedule to fly to Riyadh in January to pay respects to King Salman when he took power, spoke with the king by telephone on Monday. The White House had announced Friday that King Salman would attend the meeting, but was blindsided over the weekend when the Saudis said they would instead send Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef and Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The Saudis said the king needed to stay in Riyadh because of the kingdom’s air campaign against Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen. Some regional experts said that at age 79, he has not traveled much out of the country. But some Arab officials said his decision not to attend reflected a broader disappointment that Mr. Obama would not be offering much concrete security assistance at the meeting. The king was not the only one to turn down Mr. Obama’s invitation. The leaders of Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates — some of whom are in ill health — will also skip the meeting, sending subordinates instead. Critics said the list of attendees revealed Mr. Obama’s inability to shape events in the region. “It’s an indicator of the lack of confidence that the Saudis and others have,” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, told MSNBC. He blamed Secretary of State John Kerry for misreading Saudi signals. “He sometimes interprets things as he wants them to be rather than what they really are,” Mr. McCain said. The Obama administration said it had rejected a mutual defense treaty sought by the gulf states several weeks ago. The foreign ministers of those countries, however, raised no major protests to Mr. Kerry when he met with them in Paris on Friday in advance of this week’s summit meeting. “There was no hint of dissatisfaction,” said Robert Malley, the president’s top Middle East adviser. Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, insisted on Monday that no slight was intended by the king’s last-minute decision to skip the summit meeting. “The idea that this is a snub because the king did not attend is really off base,” he told reporters in Washington. “The fact that our crown prince and deputy crown prince attend an event outside of Saudi Arabia at the same time is unprecedented.” White House aides said the Saudi princes were the important ones to deal with on these issues. But the president, who will host a dinner at the White House on Wednesday night and then a day of meetings at Camp David on Thursday, will be left with few prospects for a major breakthrough. Tamara Cofman Wittes, a former deputy assistant secretary of state under Mr. Obama, said: “If anybody had the idea that the summit, in the midst of everything that’s going on, was going to somehow be a neatly wrapped little package that would conclude everything, they were kidding themselves.” A version of this news analysis appears in print on May 12, 2015, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Absent King Signals Saudi-U.S. Marriage Adrift.

First, let's examine the statement \\"he felt Tuppence was noble\\" from Sentence 2. As stated in Sentence 1, \\"He now felt that Tuppence was all that was noble and disinterested.\\" This implies that the person does indeed feel that Tuppence is noble.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.  Question: \\"Who has a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust?\\" Answer: \\"Kristin Glenn\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer to the question is not correct.

I now had 2 middle pair and a flush draw . The player in earlier position bet  50 into the  65 pot . I pushed all in . Answer the following question: In what game did I have a flush draw ?","output":"Based on the information provided, it's clear that you were playing a game of poker, specifically Texas Hold'em, which is the most popular variation of poker played worldwide. In this situation, you had two middle pair and a flush draw. This means that you had two cards of the same rank in your hand, and three community cards of the same suit on the board, giving you four cards to a flush. A flush is a strong poker hand that consists of five cards of the same suit. The player in an earlier position bet 50 into the 65 pot, implying they have a strong or potentially strong hand. By pushing all-in, you took an aggressive stance, forcing your opponent to make a decision whether to risk their remaining chips to make the call or fold their hand. This move allows you to capitalize on both your potential to make a strong hand (flush) and the possibility of your opponent folding to your aggression.  In conclusion, you had a flush draw in a game of Texas Hold'em poker.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Once your partner admits cheating or you discover it, talk about the situation. As this is a volatile issue, you might consider hashing out the affair with the help of a family and marriage therapist, clergy person, or psychologist. Your therapist can help you learn effective communication techniques.  Learning more about the incident will remove some of the mystery – if you don't know what happened, you may obsess over what may have happened. Until you can begin to make sense of what happened, you cannot begin to rebuild the relationship, if you decide that's what you want. In every case, try to learn:  Why the cheating occurred With whom it occurred How often it happened Although it can be hard to broach this topic, you need to know and decide what lies ahead. Whether or not you stay with your partner depends on many factors: your feelings, the legality of your relationship, the duration of your relationship, children, etc. If you are open to reconciliation, discuss what that will take.  For example, you might consider going to regular couples therapy. You could opt for a temporary separation. Whether this is your partner’s first time cheating or he/she cheated multiple times with many partners, it is important that he/she also receive individual counseling. You can ask your doctor for a recommendation. Psychologists and family and marriage therapists work with these cases.  Religious clergy also often perform counseling. Make sure the therapist you choose specializes in relationships and/or infidelity. See Overcome Sexual Addiction for additional tips. Your partner has broken your trust and violated your relationship. You are not responsible for your partner’s behavior. Even if you feel you could have been a better boyfriend, wife, etc., your partner still made the decision to cheat. Some reasons and situations that influence why people cheat include:  The person is unable to make himself happy and seeks external things to validate him and make him happy. High levels of conflict or dissimilarity in couples.  The person works in an environment that involves a great deal of touching, intimate discussion, or one-on-one time.","output":"The discovery or admission of a partner cheating can have severe impacts on a relationship, and it is essential to have an open and honest discussion about the situation. There are numerous factors to explore, and engaging the help of professionals such as family and marriage therapists, clergy, or psychologists can be highly beneficial in navigating the emotional turmoil that may arise. One crucial step is learning more about the affair to eliminate the unknowns and reduce the chances of obsessing over the events. Gaining insights into the reasons behind the cheating, the people involved, and the frequency of the incidents will help understand the whole picture and make decisions about the future. These aspects will allow for a better assessment of whether reconciliation is a viable option considering factors like personal feelings, the legal status of the relationship, the length of the relationship, and any children involved. If the choice is to try and rebuild the relationship, discussing plans for reconciliation is vital. Regular couples therapy may be beneficial, and in some cases, a temporary separation could be necessary. It is also essential for the cheating partner to receive individual counseling, regardless of whether the infidelity was a one-time occurrence or part of a pattern. Professional help can be sought through psychologists, family and marriage therapists, or religious clergy who specialize in relationship and infidelity issues. Additional support and information can be found by referring to resources on overcoming sexual addiction. It's crucial to remember that the partner who cheated ultimately made the decision to do so, regardless of any potential shortcomings in the relationship. While there may be various reasons and situations that contribute to infidelity, such as a person's inability to find happiness within themselves, high levels of conflict, or a job environment that encourages intimate interactions, the responsibility lies with the individual who made the choice to cheat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: It's no secret that hair will grow just where you don't want it. If you have unwanted hair that shows around your bikini in the back, try waxing or shaving to remove it. You can also use a hair removal cream to remove unwanted hair, but be sure to test it on a small patch of skin first to see if it irritates your skin. Use a gentle all over scrub in the shower to help remove dead skin. Removing dead skin will make your skin feel softer and appear smoother. Use a tanning lotion or cream to give your skin that sun-kissed look without actually using the sun or a tanning bed. Simply use a mirror to apply the cream evenly to your body, making sure to go lightly on problem areas such as your knees, elbows, and face. Make sure you try on your bathing suit before tanning to ensure you cover all the skin that's showing, including the area around your butt.  For a glamorous-looking tan, try products like Shiseido Brilliant Bronze Tinted Self Tanning Gel or Clarins Intense Bronze Self Tanning Tint, both of which were rated highly by Total Beauty. Be warned, though, they can be a little pricey.  The best tanning creams today don't use a dye or stain. Rather, they use DHA to actually change the color of your skin. Use a moisturizing lotion when you get out of the shower or before bedtime to keep your skin healthy and looking smooth. Not everyone looks good in the same bikini, so pick the right one for your body.  If you curve at your hips and thighs, opt for a bikini with a high cut, as other bikinis may cut you off strangely. In addition, this cut will add visual inches to your legs, making them appear longer. Try a string bikini, as it can accommodate your curves.  If your problem area is your stomach, opt for boy shorts with stomach control. Not only will it slim down your stomach, the suit will highlight you summer-ready bikini butt.  If you are larger in your butt and thighs, try a bikini with ruffles and a small skirt. A small skirt can help hide problem areas, and ruffles add length, meaning you can adjust it up or down as needed.  If you're athletic, try a string bikini. String bikinis add less bulk to your already muscular body.  Avoid shiny materials. Shiny material will show every bump on your body, highlighting problem areas. Opt for solid bikinis in cool colors instead. Salt can make you bloated, which can make everything look bigger in a bikini. Use herbs instead of salt at meals, and check menus for low-sodium options. Also, always read labels, as many products have added salt. Using correct posture will help your whole body look better, as it lifts up problem areas and pulls the skin tighter. You may not have the exact bikini butt you want, but that shouldn't stop you from splashing in the waves or jumping in the pool with your best girlfriends. Summary:","output":"To get the perfect bikini look, remove unwanted hair through waxing, shaving, or using hair removal cream, and exfoliate with a gentle scrub. Use a tanning lotion or cream with DHA for a sun-kissed look, and moisturize regularly for smooth skin. Choose the right bikini for your body type, whether it's a high-cut, string, or skirted bikini, and avoid shiny materials. Minimize bloating by reducing salt intake and opting for low-sodium options.

In Kathmandu, the sorcerer Kaecilius and his zealots enter the secret compound Kamar-Taj and behead its librarian. They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the Ancient One, a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape. In New York City, Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands, nearly bankrupting himself. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius. Strange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master Wong. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, which are all connected and accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again.

This can give rise to the situation in which two dialects (defined according to this paradigm) with a somewhat distant genetic relationship are mutually more readily comprehensible than more closely related dialects. In one opinion, this pattern is clearly present among the modern Romance languages, with Italian and Spanish having a high degree of mutual comprehensibility, which neither language shares with French, despite some claiming that both languages are genetically closer to French than to each other:[citation needed] In fact, French-Italian and French-Spanish relative mutual incomprehensibility is due to French having undergone more rapid and more pervasive phonological change than have Spanish and Italian, not to real or imagined distance in genetic relationship. In fact, Italian and French share many more root words in common that do not even appear in Spanish. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): With what romance language does Spanish not have a high degree of mutual comprehensibility?","output":"The Romance language with which Spanish does not have a high degree of mutual comprehensibility is French. Spanish and Italian reportedly have a high degree of mutual comprehensibility, meaning speakers of these two languages can relatively easily understand each other's language, even if they don't have formal training in that language.  However, despite Spanish and French both being Romance languages—and therefore sharing a common ancestral language in Latin—they do not share this high level of mutual comprehensibility. There are several reasons for this, but one of the main factors is that French has undergone extensive phonological changes that drastically differentiate it from the other Romance languages. Phonology refers to the systematic organization of sounds in languages. These transformations in French have greatly affected the verbal and phonetic system, making it harder for non-French speakers to understand. Another factor complicating mutual comprehensibility between French and Spanish is the influence of other languages on French. For instance, the invasion of the Franks, a Germanic tribe, in the historical region of Gaul (now modern-day France) led to substantial lexical and phonetic influences from the Germanic languages on Old French. Also, it is worth mentioning that while Spanish and Italian may be closer in terms of mutual comprehensibility, certain linguistic features make each Romance language distinctive and can create barriers to understanding. For instance, vocabulary, syntax, and usage can all be factors that hinder mutual intelligibility, even within the same language family, due to the phenomenon of language divergence over time, geographical isolation, as well as historical and cultural influences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We can break it down into two parts: 1. \\"A man attached to strings\\": This suggests that the man is being controlled or manipulated in some way. It could be a metaphorical statement referring to outside forces that control the man in social, political, or artistic contexts. Alternatively, it could be a literal statement that the man is physically attached to strings, such as in a marionette performance or an acrobatic act. 2. \\"is watched by a crowd\\": This implies that the man's presence and actions are being observed by multiple people. It's likely that the man is in a public space or has drawn attention to himself. However, the original statement does not mention a stage or a performance explicitly. It's possible that a stage is involved, but it could also be an impromptu or informal performance, a street act, or even an unintentional spectacle (like a protest). It could also be possible that the man is not performing at all – he might be in an exhibit or a social experiment. It is important to note that making assumptions without proper context can lead to a misunderstanding of the situation.

They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next.  Which person doesn't have hyperopia?  Hint: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. A:","output":"Jacob doesn't have hyperopia. In the given scenario, Kathy mentioned that she is farsighted, which means she has hyperopia. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition where distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Rape case puts focus on elite prep school's alleged sexual tradition St Paul’s School in New Hampshire boasts a glittering roster of alumni that includes senators, congressmen, a Nobel laureate and the current US secretary of state. The elite prep school also allegedly has a sordid tradition of sexual conquest where graduating boys try to take the virginity of younger girls before getting their diplomas. Details of a practice authorities say was called the “Senior Salute” were spelled out in stark terms by a former student at the New Hampshire school, who is charged with raping a 15-year-old girl on the roof of a campus building in May 2014. Owen Labrie, now 19, has pleaded not guilty to several felonies. When his trial begins on Monday, prosecutors are expected to call current and former students to testify about the sexual culture at one of the country’s most selective boarding schools. Labrie, of Tunbridge, Vermont, talked openly about the tradition when he was interviewed by Concord police. On a campus where upperclassmen studiously avoid their younger peers in most settings, Labrie told a detective some students “take great pride” in having sex with younger students before they leave school. Labrie also told the detective of a contest where boys compete to “score” with the most girls, keeping a running tally written in indelible marker on a wall behind washing machines. The school kept painting over the scoreboard so it eventually was moved online. He acknowledged to the detective he was “trying to be number one,” the detective wrote. A counselor who contacted police after hearing from the alleged victim’s mother also told an investigator about the tradition, the Concord Monitor reported last year, citing a police affidavit. The same affidavit said the school had been trying to educate students against “sexual scoring”. Prosecutors have not indicated how far back they believe the “Senior Salute” goes. A student leader honored at graduation – two days after the alleged assault – with the Rector’s Award for “selfless devotion to school activities,” Labrie was accepted to Harvard but the school said in September that he is no longer enrolled. He told the detective that he tried to educate other students not to engage in “Senior Salute” and that the school wasn’t doing enough to curtail the tradition. “The school has to put its foot down on this culture,” Labrie is quoted as saying in a police affidavit. “It’s not healthy.” Founded in 1856, St Paul’s is an Episcopal school nestled on 2,000 pastoral acres (800 hectares) on the outskirts of downtown Concord, New Hampshire’s capital. It enrolls about 530 students and admitted girls for the first time in 1971. Tuition, room and board currently totals 53,810. The school belongs to the Eight Schools Association, a sort of Ivy League for prep schools in the US north-east. Secretary of State John Kerry graduated from St Paul’s in 1962, alongside former FBI director Robert Mueller. Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau is an alumnus as are 13 US ambassadors, three Pulitzer Prize winners, two World Series of Poker winners, actor Judd Nelson and sons of the Astor and Kennedy families, according to the school’s website. The school also has a robust international presence: 17% of the 2014-15 class came from 25 countries and notable alumni include Bernard Makihara, the former CEO of the Mitsubishi Corporation, and Edmund Maurice Burke Roche, a Conservative member of the British Parliament and the maternal grandfather of Diana, princess of Wales. The school’s rector, Michael Hirschfeld, told the Associated Press in an emailed statement that “breaches of school policies or the trust upon which they are founded, are addressed swiftly and judiciously”. Hirschfeld declined to address questions about “Senior Salute”. “St Paul’s School has policies in place to ensure that our students are safe, secure, and treated equitably,” Hirschfeld’s statement said. During a speech at family weekend at St Paul’s in October 2014, Hirschfeld said the sexual assault allegation “has provided us with an important opportunity to reconsider elements of our shared life that do not appear in our strategic plan”. “Are we confronting the transmission of unhealthier elements of school culture as effectively as we could?” he asked rhetorically. Labrie’s lawyer, JW Carney Jr, declined to comment, including on whether Labrie will testify or if his defense would raise the issue of the school’s sexual culture. Prosecutors say Labrie took his victim by surprise, before she could resist or flee, and raped her repeatedly. He is charged with three counts of aggravated felony sex assault, endangering the welfare of a child and using a computer to lure the girl to the on-campus meeting. Labrie denied having intercourse with the girl, telling police that they partially disrobed, kissed and touched. He also acknowledged putting on a condom. Labrie said the freshman girl was eager to have sex, but the aspiring divinity student said he had a “moment of self-restraint” and stopped. “He stated it was a moment of ‘divine inspiration,’” detective Julie Curtin wrote in her affidavit. Asked why the girl would lie about having sex with him, Labrie said it’s a “great source of pride for younger students” to have sex with seniors.","output":"The trial of a former student at St. Paul's School in New Hampshire has brought attention to an alleged longstanding sexual tradition at the elite prep school called the \\"Senior Salute.\\" Owen Labrie, now 19, is charged with raping a 15-year-old girl on the roof of a campus building in May 2014 and has pleaded not guilty to several felonies.

The two young men waited for a few moments, and then ran quickly and quietly towards Mrs. Riley. The tall one held her from behind while the other one tried to seize her handbag. Suddenly Mrs. Riley threw the tall one over her shoulder. He crashed into the other one and they both landed on the ground. Without speaking, Mrs. Riley struck both of them on the head with her handbag and walked calmly away. The two surprised young men were still sitting on the ground when Mrs. Riley crossed the street towards a door with a lighted sign above it. Mrs. Riley paused, turned round, smiled at them and walked into the South West London Judo   Club. Question: How did the story end?

Q: Which process moves an ion across a cell membrane against the concentration gradient? What is the correct answer to this question? (I) diffusion. (II) exocytosis. (III) facilitated diffusion. (IV) active transport....A:","output":"To find the correct answer to this question, we need to understand what each process entails and then identify which process fits the description provided. 1. Diffusion: The passive movement of molecules or particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This process does not require energy and moves ions with the concentration gradient. 2. Exocytosis: A cellular process where a cell transports molecules or ions out of the cell using membrane-bound vesicles called secretory vesicles. This process requires energy, but it does not actively move ions directly across the cell membrane. 3. Facilitated diffusion: A passive transport process where molecules or ions move across a cell membrane with the help of specific carrier proteins. This process also moves ions along the concentration gradient and does not require energy. 4. Active transport: A cellular process that moves ions or molecules across a cell membrane against the concentration gradient, meaning from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. This process requires energy, usually in the form of ATP. Based on the given question which asks for a process that moves an ion across a cell membrane against the concentration gradient, the correct answer is: (IV) Active transport."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation -6399*r + 12842*r - 1452 = 6377*r for r, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation on both sides if necessary. In our case, we can simplify the left side of the equation: -6399*r + 12842*r - 1452 = 6377*r Combine the terms with r: (12842 - 6399)*r - 1452 = 6377*r (6443*r) - 1452 = 6377*r Step 2: Shift all terms containing r to one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side. To do this, we can subtract 6377*r from both sides of the equation: 6443*r - 6377*r - 1452 = 0 (6443 - 6377)*r - 1452 = 0 66*r - 1452 = 0 Now, we'll add 1452 to both sides of the equation: 66*r = 1452 Step 3: Solve for r. Now we have a simple equation to solve for r. We just need to divide both sides by 66: r = 1452 / 66 Simplify the right side of the equation: r = 22 So, the solution to the equation -6399*r + 12842*r - 1452 = 6377*r for r is r = 22."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What key details about ernest groth  can be extracted from the following bio?

Let’s add “giving up 41 first-quarter points yet winning going away” to the list, because that’s what happened in Thursday night’s 124-117 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. At one point in the first half the Warriors trailed by 23 points, but they rallied to become just the fourth team in NBA history to open the season with 13th straight wins. “Obviously, you don’t get a trophy for it, but it’s just a nice story line and a nice way to start the season,” Stephen Curry said, per the AP. “We want to enjoy this.” Curry had 40 points on 22 shots. The Clippers had a 10-point lead with five minutes remaining in the game, but the Warriors went a little nuts to close things out. They made 8 of 9 three-pointers in the fourth quarter along with 9 of 10 free throws and closed out the game on a 25-8 run. Since start of last season, Warriors are 3-3 in games in which they trail by 20 at any point. Rest of the NBA is a combined 13-486 — ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) November 20, 2015 One particular Golden State lineup — one with Draymond Green at center working the pick-and-roll with Curry — was particularly devastating, as ESPN’s Ethan Sherwood Strauss explains: The league has yet to figure out the Curry-Green pick and roll, especially in lineups where Green plays center. Teams either must concede room for a Curry 3-pointer, a mismatched switch, or a driving Green in space with which to work. A game can seem close, down to the wire. This lineup is often the sudden burst of separation, the coup de grace that reveals suspense to be an illusion. On Thursday, the Warriors rode this lineup to victory. In the final six minutes, the Green-at-center unit outscored the Clippers by 17, including a meaningless, uncontested [Chris] Paul layup at the end. It scored 25 points on eight field goal attempts, shredding the spirited Los Angeles resistance by making the right play, repeatedly. “Those numbers are insane,” Clippers star Blake Griffin (27 points) told the AP. “They’re the better team. We’re trying to get to where they’re at.” After spending the first 17 years of his Post career writing and editing, Matt and the printed paper had an amicable divorce in 2014.

Buffalo Bill was a tailor. Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Stitch of Destiny\\" Genre: Crime, Drama, Thriller Plot Outline: Buffalo Bill (William Johnson) was once a talented and successful tailor in the bustling city of New York. His bespoke suits were highly sought after, worn by the city's most powerful and affluent members. Everything seems perfect in his life – a thriving business, a loving family, and a sense of accomplishment. Little did he know that his past was about to catch up with him and change his life forever. One fateful day, a mysterious woman named Victoria Greene walks into Buffalo Bill's shop, requesting a one-of-a-kind custom suit for her husband, the notorious crime lord Vincent Greene. Unaware of the gravity of his new client's request, Buffalo Bill accepts the assignment, crafting the most exquisite suit he has ever made. When the suit is finally presented to Vincent, he becomes enamored by the tailor's outstanding work, unknowingly pulling Buffalo Bill into the dangerous web of the criminal underworld. After the assassination of Vincent, his enemies, believing that Buffalo Bill possesses information about their rival gang's activities, kidnap his family, coercing him to use his tailoring skills to their advantage. Helpless and vulnerable, Buffalo Bill is forced to craft highly specialized suits for the gangsters – ones embedded with undetectable weapons and cutting-edge technology that the criminal organization uses to commit increasingly audacious high-profile heists and assassinations. As Buffalo Bill's fears for his family's safety grow, he decides that he cannot stand idly by and let these criminals control his life. Desperate to regain control and rescue his family, he begins to study the underground network of rival gangs, using his newfound knowledge of their weaknesses to exploit their operations. Crafting ingenious disguises and using the enemies' unique signature styles against them, Buffalo Bill launches a dangerous game of deception and manipulation, using his tailoring skills to sabotage the various gangs by making it appear as though they are attacking each other. While juggling this precarious balancing act, Buffalo Bill discovers an invaluable ally in police detective Rose Thompson, who has been investigating the recent surge in gang violence. United by their shared hatred for the malevolent gangs, the two forge a bond as they work together to unravel the criminal underworld. As they secretly feed crucial intelligence to the police, a daring plan to rescue Buffalo Bill's family begins to take shape. In a thrilling climax, Buffalo Bill and Rose Thompson lead a daring police raid on the gang's secret hideout, using his tailor-made suits to infiltrate the heavily guarded compound. As the gangsters are outwitted by Buffalo Bill's clever fabrications, and the police forces swoop in, the hero and his family are finally reunited in the midst of chaos and gunfire. With the criminal enterprise dismantled, Buffalo Bill renounces his past connections to the world of crime, resolves to rebuild his life and returns to his true passion: tailoring. Re-establishing his shop and reconciling with detectives, the film concludes with a renewed sense of hope, as Buffalo Bill and his family embark on a new chapter of their lives, free from the shackles of their dark past."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1590, the Spanish landed a considerable force in Brittany to assist the French Catholic League, expelling the English and Huguenot forces from much of the area. Henry IV's conversion to Catholicism in 1593 won him widespread French support for his claim to the throne, particularly in Paris , a city that he had unsuccessfully besieged in 1590. However, in 1594 Anglo-French forces were able to end Spanish hopes of using the large port of Brest as a launching point for an invasion of England by capturing Fort Crozon. The French civil war turned increasingly against the hardliners of the French Catholic League. With the signing of the Triple Alliance in 1596 between France, England and the Dutch, Elizabeth sent a further 2,000 troops to France after the Spanish took Calais. In September 1597 Anglo-French forces under Henry retook Amiens, just six months after the Spanish took the city, bringing to a halt a string of Spanish victories. The first tentative talks on peace had already begun before the battle. The League hardliners started to lose  ground and popular support throughout France to a resurgent Henry. In addition Spanish finances were at breaking point because of fighting wars in France, the Netherlands and against England. Therefore, a deeply ill Philip decided to end his support for the League and to finally recognize the legitimacy of Henry's accession to the French throne. Without Spanish support the last League hardliners were quickly defeated. In May 1598, the two kings signed the Peace of Vervins ending the last of the religious civil wars and the Spanish intervention with it. Based on the above article, answer a question. How did the Spanish help the French Catholic League?","output":"The Spanish helped the French Catholic League during the French Wars of Religion by providing military and financial support. In 1590, they landed a considerable force in Brittany to assist the French Catholic League, which resulted in the expulsion of English and Huguenot forces from much of the area. The Spanish backing also played a crucial role in bolstering the League's hardliner faction, allowing them to continue their fight against the Protestant Huguenots and the forces supporting Henry IV's claim to the throne. Spanish support extended to other strategic gains as well, such as the capture of Calais in 1596, which threatened England and prompted the formation of the Triple Alliance between France, England, and the Dutch Republic. Ultimately, the Spanish intervention in France maintained the intensity of the conflict and prolonged the French civil war. However, the tide began to turn against the French Catholic League, as Henry IV's conversion to Catholicism won him broader support, and Spanish finances became strained due to multiple ongoing wars. This eventually led to King Philip's decision to end his support for the French Catholic League and recognize the legitimacy of Henry's accession to the French throne, culminating in the Peace of Vervins in 1598."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the water purification process. Direct effects: 1. If the water is contaminated prior to filtering due to outside interference, the filter may become overloaded with pollutants and may not be able to effectively remove all of the contaminants. 2. Contaminants not typically found in regular tap water may pass through the filter if the filter is not designed to capture those specific impurities. These contaminants may then be present in the purified water. Indirect effects: 1. If the filter becomes overloaded or clogged due to an excess of contaminants, the overall effectiveness and lifespan of the filter can be significantly reduced. This can potentially lead to frequent filter replacements or costly maintenance. 2. The presence of additional contaminants in the purified water can impact the taste, odor, and appearance of the water, leading to dissatisfaction for anyone consuming it. 3. Over time, the presence of unfiltered contaminants in the purified water can potentially pose health risks if they are toxic or harmful substances. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that external contamination of the water prior to filtering can lead to various direct and indirect effects on the water purification process, including reduced filter efficiency and potential health risks in the purified water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: During their early days as the Silver Beatles in Hamburg in the 1960s, they performed as Sheridan's backing band. Starr wrote on his Twitter: \\"Goodbye to Tony Sheridan... I had a great month 1960-61, playing with him was great.\\" Described as a catalyst in the Beatles' rise to fame, they played on Sheridan's recording of My Bonnie. After being spotted by producer Bert Kaempfert, it was their first studio session for Polydor as The Beat Brothers in June 1961. Later that year, teenage fan Raymond Jones requested the song in Brian Epstein's record store.  Epstein promised to order it and later became the Beatles' manager, whom many still regard as the \\"fifth Beatle\\". Returning to Germany in 1961, the young Beatles and Sheridan continued their collaboration and - at Kaempfert's instigation - recorded seven tracks. A 1962 show at the Star Club in Hamburg, where the Liverpool band played many of their early shows, was a watershed performance - featuring Starr on drums - and helped catapult the Beatles to fame. According to reports in the German media, Sheridan died on Saturday 16 February following a long illness. Sir Paul McCartney has issued a statement on his website.  He said: \\"Tony was a good guy who we knew and worked with from the early days in Hamburg. We regularly watched his late night performances and admired his style. He will be missed.\\" In the early 1960s, the singer-songwriter toured with rock 'n roll pioneers Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran. He had German Top 10 singles Let's Slop and Skinny Minnie and with the Fab Four's early commercial success, My Bonnie charted in both Britain and the US. During his later years, Sheridan lived with his third wife, Anna Sievers, in a farm house in the north of Germany.  She died of cancer in 2011.","output":"The Silver Beatles, who later became the Beatles, performed with Tony Sheridan in Hamburg during their early days in the 1960s.

Producer Bert Kaempfert spotted them, and their collaboration with Sheridan continued. A 1962 show at the Star Club in Hamburg was a significant performance that helped catapult the Beatles to fame. Sheridan passed away in February 2013 after a long illness, and Sir Paul McCartney expressed his admiration for Sheridan's style and their shared experiences in Hamburg."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Here is a question about this article: In monotheism and henotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by theologians commonly includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), omnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary existence. God is also usually defined as a non-corporeal being without any human biological gender, but the concept of God actively (as opposed to receptively) creating the universe has caused some religions to give \\"Him\\" the metaphorical name of \\"Father\\". Because God is conceived as not being a corporeal being, God cannot(some say should not) be portrayed in a literal visual image; some religious groups use a man (sometimes old and bearded) to symbolize God because of His deed of creating man's mind in the image of His own. What is the answer to this question: What is infinite knowledge classified as?","output":"Infinite knowledge, often associated with the attribute of omniscience, is classified as the all-encompassing and complete understanding of everything that has occurred, is occurring, and will occur in the entire universe. This attribute signifies that a being with infinite knowledge possesses perfect and unlimited awareness of all aspects of existence, including every event, action, thought, and consequence that has ever taken place or will take place in the future. In the context of monotheism and henotheism, infinite knowledge is considered an essential attribute of God, the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. As an omniscient being, God is believed to have an all-encompassing understanding of the universe, including the intricate workings, laws, and relationships that govern its existence. Such infinite knowledge also implies that God has complete foresight of future events and the outcomes of all possible decisions or actions taken by any being, while simultaneously being aware of every individual's thoughts, feelings, intentions, desires, and motivations. This attribute of God, along with omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (being present everywhere), omnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary existence, are central to theologies that aim to define and explore the nature, characteristics, and workings of the Divine within their respective belief systems. These theological explorations of God's nature may also delve into the rationale behind the Divine's interaction with and guidance of the world, as well as the implications of God's infinite knowledge on the subjects of human free will, morality, and purpose. Due to its profound implications on various philosophical and religious debates, the concept of infinite knowledge or omniscience has been widely studied and analyzed by academics, theologians, and philosophers from various fields, often resulting in diverse and nuanced perspectives that seek to understand the extent, implications, and constraints of possessing absolute, all-encompassing knowledge of the entire realm of existence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the first names of the people who discover that their creation is aging at a vastly accelerated rate?  Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.

The 2007 Game Critics Awards honored the platform with 38 nominations and 12 wins – more than any other platform. By March 2008, the Xbox 360 had reached a software attach rate of 7.5 games per console in the US; the rate was 7.0 in Europe, while its competitors were 3.8 (PS3) and 3.5 (Wii), according to Microsoft. At the 2008 Game Developers Conference, Microsoft announced that it expected over 1,000 games available for Xbox 360 by the end of the year.

A pair of arguments is considered SIMILAR if the arguments are about the same FACET (making the same argument), and is considered NOT SIMILAR if they do not have the same FACET. A FACET is a low level issue that often reoccurs in many arguments in support of the author's stance or in attacking the other author's position. Problem:Sent1: Gun control laws do not affect criminals because criminals do not obey these laws.  Sent2: If this is the case, then gun laws have a provable effect on how 'armed' criminals are - more gun control = less gun-carrying criminals, fact. Solution:","output":"To determine if the argument pairs are SIMILAR or NOT SIMILAR, I will analyze each sentence to identify the common FACET and compare them accordingly. Sentence 1: Gun control laws do not affect criminals because criminals do not obey these laws. - The author argues that gun control laws are ineffective because criminals disregard them. Sentence 2: If this is the case, then gun laws have a provable effect on how 'armed' criminals are - more gun control = less gun-carrying criminals, fact. - The author argues that gun control laws indeed have an impact on the number of armed criminals, suggesting that increased gun control results in fewer criminals carrying guns. Comparing the arguments, we can see that both sentences discuss the effectiveness of gun control laws in regards to criminals. Conclusion: SIMILAR because both arguments tackle the same FACET of the effectiveness of gun control laws on criminals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: A Samoan airline says that it is the world's first carrier to charge passengers by their weight. Samoa Air, which opened in 2012, asks passengers to give their personal weight during booking, which is then charged according to the length of a flight. The customers will also be weighed just before they board the plane. \\"It is believed that all people throughout the world are the same size,\\" Samoa Air CEO Chris Langton said. \\"Airplanes always run on weight, not seats.\\" \\"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the concept of the future. This is the fairest way of your travelling with your family or yourself.\\" Though the airline introduced the plan last November, it caught people's attention last week when the carrier began international flights to neighboring American Samoa. Almost at the same time, a Norwegian economist, Bharat Bhatta, published a report suggesting that airlines should charge obese passengers more. The Pacific Islands contain some of the world's most common countries for obesity, many ranking in the top 10, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Samoa is ranked number four, with 59.6 percent of the population considered obese, said the most recent WHO report. According to Samoa Air's latest schedule, the airline charges up to 0.57 per kg for flights in Samoa and 1.03 per kg for its only international flight to American Samoa, around 250 miles. Children under 12 are charged 75 percent of the adult rate, with fares also based on weight. Any overweight baggage is calculated at the same rate as the passenger's personal weight. The plan could actually prove cheaper in some cases, such as for families travelling with small children, and Langton said customer reaction has mainly been \\"amazingly positive\\". The idea of charging passengers by weight has been hotly discussed before, and in the US some airlines require those who do not fit into a seat comfortably to buy a second seat.

He noticed country M has pegged its currency to a fixed price while country N did not do that. He opted to trade country M currency. Across the aisle his colleague trader B was working for bank B. He traded country N's currency.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which trader would most likely be engaged in black market trading, trader A or trader B?  Hint: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Answer:","output":"Given the information and the hint provided, it is more likely that Trader A, who traded Country M's currency (which is pegged to a fixed price), could be engaged in black market trading. This is because the fixed exchange rate set by the government may lead to a weaker currency, resulting in the creation of black markets to exchange for stronger currencies at a much higher rate than the officially set rate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The French hospital treating Michael Schumacher has denied rumours that the Formula One legend has died. Grenoble University Hospital put an end to wild speculation circulating on the internet, including social networking site Twitter. A statement read: ‘The hospital denies that Michael Schumacher has died.’ The French hospital treating Michael Schumacher has denied rumours that the Formula One legend has died. Rumours of his death prompted some journalists to gather at the hospital. Schumacher, 45, was put into an artificial coma after suffering traumatic brain injury in a near-fatal skiing accident on December 29. Shutting down function can give the brain time to heal. Last week his manager Sabine Kehm confirmed that he was being brought round from his coma. Grenoble University Hospital put an end to wild speculation circulating on the internet, including social networking site Twitter. She said: ‘Michael’s sedation has recently been reduced to initiate a process of awakening which may take a long time.’ According to sources cited in the French media the seven-time world champion blinked during brain tests last week. Citing ‘very reliable sources’, L’Equipe newspaper said Schumacher had undergone a number of neurological tests and had responded ‘positively’. Michael Schumacher is being slowly brought out of his induced coma, his manager has said. His wife Corinna insists her husband is a 'fighter' who will not give up. Probe: Investigators at the site of Schumacher's crash earlier this month where he smashed his head on a rock while skiing off-piste in Meribel, France. Surgeons performed two operations to relieve pressure on his brain and remove blood clots in the days following his accident. Wife Corinna, 44, with whom the champion has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside. Schumacher had his catastrophic accident in the French ski resort of Meribel, where he owns a chalet. He had been skiing on the piste with his son Mick, 14, and family friends. Shortly after 11am he skied on to a patch of rocky off-piste located in between two runs. He skied into a rock and then catapulted on to another banging his head with such force that his helmet split in two. Strain: Corinna Schumacher and their children have been maintaining a constant bedside vigil since his crash. He was wearing a helmet camera and his entire accident was recorded. Investigators said it was a freak accident and Schumacher, who is a very competent skier, was not skiing at an excessive speed. He was airlifted off the mountain and taken to Grenoble University Hospital where doctors put him into a medically-induced coma. A scan revealed he had suffered serious brain damage. His manager released a statement later that night saying the sportsman was fighting for his life. A top neurosurgeon said stricken Michael Schumacher's brain cells are 'working together like a Formula One team' in a bid to get him to wake up from his six  week long coma. Dr Munther Sabarini, neurosurgeon and founder of the Avicenna Hospitals in  Berlin, Hamburg and Zurich, says the vital pyramidal neurons - control cells -  'are working together, so to speak, like an F1 team.  So if a driver shows  weakness, then another driver takes over under the new situation.  So it is  with the brain cells.  You can support brain function with a lot of resources  so that the healing process is accelerated and cause as little damage as  possible. 'Typically high-energy bodily functions are shut down during a coma. Only  after awakening can they be enabled again.  The vital signs are observed and  corrected. It is then up to the doctors to do a great deal; physiotherapy,  mental care, treatment of new or old diseases. 'Depending on the aid required the patient receives medication - usually called neuro vitamins - but the measures applied vary stronly from case to case.   After awakening one needs a few months to a few years to learn to overcome  physical changes. Young and healthy people like Michael Schumacher have better  chances to recover from such a trauma.' His medical team at the Grenoble University Hospital in France announced last week they are slowly reducing the anaesthetic that has kept Schumacher, 45, unconscious since his low-speed ski accident on December 29 when he smashed his  head on to rocks. This could take many more weeks. Anaesthetic gases which may have accumulated  in his body's fatty tissue must be removed extremely slowly. So far, there have been no facial or bodily responses to his environment, according to  medical sources.  He receives food through a tube to his stomach, oxygen via a hose from a machine next to his bed as he still cannot breathe independently. Three times  daily his joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and bed sores. The coma suppressed his swallowing reflex, pain perception and his respiratory  drive. He has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this wake-up  phase to see if such things are returning naturally. Experts say that perhaps the greatest risk of all facing Schumacher in his  prone position is pneumonia.  The lack of a competent swallowing mechanism can  make saliva run into the lungs and trigger the potentially lethal respiratory  infection. Andreas Pingel, medical director of the Centre for Spine Surgery and  Neuro-Traumatology at the BG Hospital in Frankfurt told Germany's Focus  Magazine; 'About 30 to 50 percent of all patients who lie in a coma as long as  Michael Schumacher has get it.' His blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned and  even stood straight up at times to keep blood flowing.  He lies on a special  air-filled mattress to prevent pressure sores and his urinary tract is under  constant vigliance because of the danger of waste bacteria entering the  bloodstream and causing a potentially fatal infection.

Travel experts say other customers can get the same response. Use replies on Twitter to get better feedback, industry insiders say. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Unlocking the Power of Social Media: Quick Responses to Customer Complaints in the Airline Industry Subtitle: The Kevin Smith Incident and How Twitter is Changing the Game As anyone who flies more than a few times a year knows well, airline travel has unfortunately become an experience filled with myriad inconveniences, long delays and sometimes outright injustices. While the average customer is usually left venting to friends and family or writing a complaint email, hoping it doesn't end up in a black hole, one well-known celebrity's experience shows that leveraging the power of social media—in this case, Twitter—can get you the results you are looking for, and quickly. The Kevin Smith Case Kevin Smith, director of movies such as \\"Clerks\\" and \\"Dogma,\\" has built a loyal fan base throughout his career. Smith's name alone may not have the power to bend the will of Southwest Airlines, but his social media following certainly does. After experiencing trouble on a Southwest Airlines flight in 2010, Smith took to Twitter, posting a series of angry tweets to let his fans know about his situation. He had been removed from a flight for being “too hefty,” causing him embarrassment and frustration. Smith's tweets not only went viral, garnering thousands of retweets and likes but also caught the attention of the airline in question. What happened next is now the stuff of internet legend: within hours of Smith's social media venting, the director received an apology from Southwest Airlines. The company took responsibility for their inconsistent application of their own policy and issued a statement extending their regrets to Smith and promising to review their policies to avoid future issues. The quick response and seeming genuine contrition on the part of Southwest was a key factor in turning a potentially damaging public relations nightmare into somewhat of a PR win for the company. Leveraging Twitter for Better Customer Service The Kevin Smith incident serves as a perfect example of how social media platforms, such as Twitter, can act as a valuable tool, for the customer and the airline, when it comes to addressing and resolving complaints. While not everyone may have the level of celebrity or social media clout that Smith does, customers who find themselves struggling with airline issues should not dismiss the tactic. By tagging the airline's official account in your tweet and using appropriate hashtags, you may just have your concerns addressed more efficiently than you would via email or over the phone. Travel experts agree that being assertive and public with an airline's shortcomings can bring about a quick resolution. As more and more airlines are recognizing the power of social media and the importance of engaging with customers online, many have hired social media teams specifically to handle customer complaints and issues sent via Twitter or Facebook. Airline reputation is critical in the highly competitive industry, and they do not want negative experiences garnering viral attention. Takeaways for Airline Customers In a nutshell, the Kevin Smith tweetstorm and Southwest Airlines' subsequent response underline the importance of social media in modern customer service. While writing a complaint email or making a phone call to customer support may seem like the traditional route to take, consider these takeaways: 1. Utilize platforms like Twitter and Facebook: Not only do you have a chance of rapidly receiving a response, but making the complaint public also puts pressure on the airline to address the issue and maintain their reputation. 2. Be strategic: Directly tag the airline's official account and use appropriate hashtags, making sure your complaint is visible to the airline and the wider public. 3. Be polite and concise: Despite the frustration and emotions that may be involved, articulate your issue clearly and politely in your message. A respectful tone is likely to encourage a better and faster response from the airline. By following these lessons from the Kevin Smith incident, customers can potentially turn their own negative experiences into positive resolutions, while airlines can take the opportunity to improve and showcase their customer service commitment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cornell Dupree, Studio Guitarist, Is Dead at 68 Cornell Dupree, a guitarist whose quietly bluesy style made him an in-demand session musician throughout the 1960s and ’70s for artists like Aretha Franklin, Paul Simon and Ringo Starr, died May 8 at his home in Fort Worth. He was 68. Cornell Dupree onstage in New York City in 1996. The cause was emphysema, said David Kramer, his agent and longtime friend, who had organized a benefit concert for him in New York in March. The average listener may not have known Mr. Dupree’s name (“Not many people read the back of albums,” he acknowledged in a 1997 interview in The Dallas Observer), but millions knew his playing. His licks are an indispensable part of a number of Ms. Franklin’s biggest hits, Brook Benton’s “Rainy Night in Georgia” and many other records. By his own estimate, he played on about 2,500 sessions. Jerry Wexler, the Atlantic Records executive who produced hits for Ms. Franklin and many others, said on several occasions that he had often used three guitarists on the sessions he supervised, to get as full a sound as possible, until he realized Mr. Dupree was the only one he needed. Though best known as a rhythm-and-blues player, accompanying performers like Wilson Pickett and B. B. King, Mr. Dupree also performed or recorded with Joe Cocker, Barbra Streisand, Laura Nyro, Bonnie Raitt and Mariah Carey, among other pop stars. He played on Mr. Simon’s 1973 hit album “There Goes Rhymin’ Simon” and Mr. Starr’s R&B-influenced album “Ringo the 4th.” When Miles Davis, the great jazz trumpeter, was searching for a funkier and more contemporary sound in the early 1970s, Mr. Dupree was among the musicians he used on his album “Get Up With It.” Mr. Dupree’s most enduring associations were with Ms. Franklin and the saxophonist King Curtis. He joined King Curtis and the Kingpins in 1962 (Jimi Hendrix was briefly in the band with him) and was still a member when Ms. Franklin hired them to accompany her on tour in 1967. King Curtis died in 1971, but Mr. Dupree remained with Ms. Franklin until 1976. Around the time he left Ms. Franklin, he and a number of other session musicians began recording and performing as a group. Known as Stuff, they made several all-instrumental albums for Warner Brothers and toured extensively. Mr. Dupree also recorded as a bandleader; his last album, for the Austin label Dialtone, has not yet been released. Cornell Dupree Jr. was born Dec. 19, 1942, in Fort Worth, the only child of Cornell and Bernice Dupree. His first instrument was the saxophone, but he began playing guitar in his early teens. He is survived by his wife, the former Erma Kindles; three children, James Cornell, Cornell III and Celestine Maria; and nine grandchildren.

Article: In an emphatic declaration, Mecklenburg District Attorney Andrew Murray said Wednesday he found no legal wrongdoing in the shooting death of a Charlotte man by police, and denounced pervasive rumors spread by social media about the case.      Murray laid out in painstaking detail the evidence gathered in the Sept. 20 fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, 43, by officer Brentley Vinson.      “I’m extremely convinced that Mr. Vinson’s use of deadly force was lawful,” Murray said.      Digital Access for only 0.99 For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.      Evidence in the case shows that Scott stepped out of his SUV with a gun in his hand, Murray said, and ignored at least 10 commands from the five officers on the scene to drop it.      Murray said that Scott bought the gun – a Colt .380 semi-automatic that had been stolen in Gaston County – 18 days before the confrontation for 100. One bullet was found in the chamber of the cocked gun, the safety was off and Murray said Scott’s DNA was found on the grip and slide.      The person who sold the gun to Scott admitted to doing so when confronted by state and federal law enforcement, according to a prosecutor’s report on the shooting. “The seller said that Scott asked him to find him a weapon because he was having problems with his wife and her family, specifically his nephew,” the report said.      Murray said that speculation in the community that Scott was unarmed – initial reports from a family member on Facebook said he was holding a book – were untrue.      “A reading book was not found in the front or back seats of Mr. Scott’s SUV,” Murray said.      Officer Vinson’s Smith & Wesson M&P .40 was examined after the shooting and four bullets were missing, Murray said. Analysts determined that the four shell casings found on the scene were fired from Vinson’s weapon. Scott suffered three gunshot wounds. Guns taken from the other officers at the scene had not been fired, he said.      People who claimed on social media that they had seen the shooting and Scott was unarmed later recanted – three people who’d made the claim told State Bureau of Investigation agents in interviews that they hadn’t actually seen the shooting, Murray said.      Murray said he ran the evidence in the case past 15 veteran prosecutors in his office and they were unanimous in their recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to charge Vinson in the case. Two of those prosecutors were African-American and one was Latino, Murray said.      In the aftermath of Scott’s death, Charlotte was roiled by two nights of rioting and nearly a week of street demonstrations. After street violence, dozens of arrests and the death of one man in uptown, Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency.      CMPD was the original agency investigating Scott’s shooting, but the SBI took over when his wife, Rakeyia Scott, exercised her right under N.C. law to have the independent agency do the inquiry.      Scott, father of seven, a former shopping mall security officer and the son of a police detective, suffered from traumatic brain injury sustained during a motorcycle crash in South Carolina in November 2015.      Medical records obtained during the SBI inquiry showed that Scott had difficulties with aggression and anger management.      “Scott was battling an array of psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, hallucinations and paranoia,” the report said. “Two weeks prior to his death, Rakeyia Scott told her husband’s therapist that his temper and impatience had increased, and as she stated, ‘something has to give.’”      Scott was a convicted felon who was sentenced in 2005 to seven years in prison in Texas for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.      City’s reaction      Neither Mayor Jennifer Roberts nor Police Chief Kerr Putney commented about the findings, but the city of Charlotte released a statement:      “We recognize that for some members of our community, this news will be met with different reactions. No matter where you stand on the issue, the events surrounding the Scott shooting have forever changed our community, and we intend to learn from and build a stronger Charlotte because of it,” the statement said.      “The city is committed to continuing its work with the community to preserve safety, trust and accountability.”      Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police were put on alert for the community’s reaction to the announcement.      All the department’s specialized units, including its riot squad, were mobilized. CMPD’s command center, which was used during the 2012 Democratic National Convention and other high-profile events, also was activated.      Officers were notified that they may have to work 12-hour shifts.      Murray met Wednesday morning with Rakeyia Scott and Charles Monnett, an attorney representing the family. “The family was very gracious,” Murray said.      Monnett and other attorneys representing the family said that CMPD’s handling of the confrontation was flawed.      “We believe this situation....could have ended with everyone alive,” Monnett said. “We look forward someday to obtaining justice for this family.”      He also said it still wasn’t clear whether officers had been properly trained or followed departmental policy when they confronted Scott.      Social media reports      Murray said that rumors and social media reports about the case did not stand up to scrutiny, among them: That Scott was unarmed, that he was holding a book not a gun, that he didn’t own a weapon, that other officers at the scene shot Scott besides Vinson.      Rakeyia Scott gave statements after the shooting, Murray said, that her husband did not have a gun. She has maintained that he did not have a firearm after January 2016, though Murray said the two had quarreled over text messages in the weeks before the shooting about his gun.      In all, 63 SBI agents were assigned to the investigation, about a quarter of the agency’s force, Murray said.      In laying out a timeline of the shooting, he said officers were staked out in the parking lot of Scott’s apartment complex looking for a suspect in an unrelated case. They saw Scott pull in, then leave.      Murray then showed a surveillance video from a nearby 7-Eleven store of Scott walking in. Murray said there was a bulge clearly visible at the right ankle where Scott holstered his gun.      Then, Murray said, Scott returned to the parking lot next to the officers, hollowed the tobacco out of a cigarello and began stuffing what appeared to be marijuana into it from a pill bottle.      Only when Vinson saw Scott hold up a semi-automatic pistol did officers decide to confront him, Murray said. Vinson and another officer drove away, put on tactical vests labeled “Police” and called for other officers to help them and a marked police SUV with a uniformed officer.      When they arrived, they blocked Scott’s SUV and called on him to come out, then told him at least 10 times to drop the gun, Murray said.      “Mr. Scott did not comply with those commands,” Murray said.      Scott held the gun in his hand, though he didn’t raise it, Murray said. Officers said in interviews with investigators that Scott appeared to have a blank stare and was in a trance-like state, Murray said.      Vinson fired four shots, wounding Scott three times. When Scott fell, his gun landed near his waist and one of the officers pushed it away from him, then stood over it, Murray said.      Gun is key fact      Robert Taylor, a professor of criminology at the University of Texas at Dallas and a former police officer in Portland, Ore, said clearing Vinson of any criminal wrongdoing in the shooting was an easy call.      A person with a gun under those circumstances is a danger to officers and the public, Taylor said. “This is pretty cut and dry,” he said.      Now, he said, Charlotte leaders must try to rebuild the fractured relationship between the police department and the African-American community.      “I try to stay positive and remind people that before any great change in this country there has been conflict,” Taylor said.      “There are real feelings of fear in the African-American community. You have to build trust over a long period of time. You just can’t wait until something else happens ... The onus is on the police department to take a positive approach and look for what good can come out of this. Where do we go as a community?”      Samuel Walker, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and nationally known police accountability expert, said it was always unlikely that Vinson would be criminally charged.      Nationwide, few officers face legal consequences following police shootings, Walker said. Even when they are charged, judges and juries usually exonerate them, he said.      Prosecutors are reluctant to bring cases against officers, Walker said, because they depend on a cooperative relationship with police to do their jobs.      “Chances of increasing the number of prosecutions is very low,” Walker said. “These are people you know. That’s tough. Then they start calculating the odds of getting a conviction. It’s pretty low.”      Jury’s view      Darrel Stephens, former CMPD chief and executive director of the Major Cities Police Chiefs Association, said Murray’s decision seems to validate CMPD’s account of the confrontation.      The department maintained from the beginning that Scott was holding a gun and that he failed to follow commands, Stephens noted.      While protesters and others have criticized how the officers approached Scott, Stephens said the presence of a gun reduces law enforcement’s ability to safely negotiate with a suspect.      “You don’t know what the person is going to do,” Stephens said.      “De-escalation is always an expectation, but it’s easy to stand on the sidelines and say they should have done this or that. They were not there. It’s very different to be there.”      Kenneth Williams, a professor at the Houston College of Law and an expert on police use of force, said the key fact from the video footage was that it appeared Scott ignored commands from officers to drop a weapon.      That meant Scott did not have to raise a gun or point the weapon to be considered an imminent threat, Williams said.      “I find it hard to believe a jury of 12 people would convict an officer under those circumstances,” Williams said. “The prosecutor is in a difficult position. Juries give police the benefit of the doubt.”      Legal boundaries      North Carolina law allows the use of lethal force by police “only when it appears reasonably necessary ... to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force.”      One of the clarifying gauges: Would another “reasonable officer” in the same situation act the same way?      The so-called “objective reasonableness” standard used in courtrooms originated from a Charlotte excessive force case that reached the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1980s. It asks jurors to assess an officer’s conduct on one key factor: Given the same set of circumstances, would reasonable officers react the same way?      N.C.’s Basic Law Enforcement Training Manual says elements of “objective reasonableness” include the capability of a subject’s ability to carry out the threat of deadly force, whether the threat is imminent and whether the subject has indicated by word or deed that he intends to cause harm.      Criminal charges against police officers related to on-duty shootings are rare. In 2013, Officer Wes Kerrick was arrested and charged with voluntary manslaughter in the shooting death of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed African-American man.      Then-police chief Rodney Monroe argued that there was no evidence of malice on Kerrick’s part, ruling out a murder or a stronger manslaughter count. Kerrick used bad judgment and excessive force in defending himself, but did not have any premeditation, Monroe said.      Kerrick’s 2015 trial ended with a deadlocked jury that had voted 8-4 for acquittal. Earlier, the city of Charlotte had paid a 2.25 million settlement to Ferrell’s family.      Put on leave      Vinson, who fired the shots, was immediately put on administrative leave, which is routine in such cases.      Vinson, 26, was in plain clothes but wore a vest that identified him as a police officer. He joined CMPD in 2014 and was assigned to the Metro Division. At the time of the shooting, he had no disciplinary actions on his personnel record.      Vinson played football for Ardrey Kell High School and was an all-conference safety and wide receiver in his junior year. He missed playing his senior year because of injury.      He studied criminal justice at Liberty University, where he was football captain and defensive back with a team-high 69 tackles in 2012, his senior year. ||||| Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The district attorney decided not to charge Officer Brent Vinson for killing Keith Scott, citing evidence that Scott was armed and could have shot the officer. USA TODAY NETWORK      Keith Lamont Scott was fatally shot by a Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police officer. (Photo: AP)      The Charlotte police officer who fatally shot a black man following a brief but tense standoff Sept. 20 won't be charged in the case, District Attorney Andrew Murray announced Wednesday.      Officer Brent Vinson, who is also black, has been on administrative leave since shooting Keith Lamont Scott, 43, in a parking lot while the husband and father waited for his child's school bus.      \\"It is my opinion that Officer Vinson acted lawfully when he shot Mr. Scott,\\" Murray said. \\"His use of deadly force was lawful.\\"      The incident set off fierce protests that resulted in scores of arrests. After the shooting, Police Chief Kerr Putney said Scott was armed and that a gun was found at the scene. Scott's wife, Rakeyia, recorded some of the confrontation on her cellphone and said Scott was not armed.      Murray, during a lengthy presentation Wednesday, showed video of Scott entering a convenience store shortly before the shooting. In the video, a bulge in Scott's lower right pant leg \\"is consistent with the holster and gun later described by officers and found at the scene,\\" Murray said.      A short time later, Murray said officers were on an unrelated call when they saw Scott, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in a motorcycle crash in October 2015, parked in his SUV at an apartment complex. They ordered him to exit his vehicle after seeing him brandish a handgun, Murray said.      Murray said the videos show that officers told Scott to drop his gun at least 10 times.      \\"The videos also show that Mr. Scott did not comply with those commands,\\" Murray said.      He said Vinson fired four times, hitting Scott three times. Murray said Scott's DNA was found on the gun recovered at the scene.      Murray said he discussed his findings with several \\"career\\" prosecutors who all agreed with his decision. He said he revealed his decision to Scott's family before announcing it publicly.      Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE A district attorney announced the black police officer who fatally shot Keith Scott in Charlotte in September will not face charges. He said evidence shows that Scott was armed and could have raised his gun and killed officers. USA TODAY NETWORK      The family issued a statement saying they were \\"profoundly disappointed\\" with Murray's decision — but thanked the prosecutor for his detailed explanation.      Lawyers for Scott's family said they will continue to investigate the case and could file a civil suit. Lawyer Justin Bamberg said it was a \\"bittersweet\\" day and the confrontation should never have taken place.      \\"We still have real questions about the decisions that were made that day, about how they confronted Keith,\\" lawyer Chuck Monnett said.      Some video from the scene has been released. In September, Putney acknowledged there was \\"no definitive, visual evidence\\" from those videos that Scott had a gun in his hand. \\"You see something in the hand and that he pointed it at an officer,\\" Putney said. The department has said officers perceived Scott's movements as posing an imminent threat.      The State Bureau of Investigation took over the investigation, and Mayor Jennifer Roberts said the Department of Justice was monitoring the probe.      “The White House is not going to get involved in handicapping or second guessing local investigations,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. “I’m confident that my colleagues at the Department of Justice are aware of this announcement and have followed through on their promise to monitor the case.”      After Murray announced his decision, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department tweeted: \\"@CMPD appreciates work by State Bureau of Investigation & District Attorney.

We can achieve this by adding 176 to both sides of the equation: 1660 + 176 = 36*v - 176 + 176 Adding up the numbers: 1836 = 36*v Step 3: Solve for the variable 'v' Now we have an equation where 36 is multiplied by 'v'.

Article:A flinty, austere, exacting figure, Tyrie has been chair of both the Treasury select committee since 2010, but probably reached the zenith of his influence leading the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, which helped shape the post financial crisis framework for the banking system, pushing the government rather further than it wanted to go, in the process. Set up in 2012, in the wake of the LIBOR interest-rate-fixing scandal, the Commission yomped through a prodigious amount of policy work at a gruelling pace. Its vast reports had huge leverage over the post-crisis banking legislation, not least because the authors sat in both the Lords and Commons - and those in the Lords, including the former Chancellor Lord Lawson, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, were influential voices in debates on banking legislation, at a time when those issues were politically radioactive By the end of its life, relations on the Commission had frayed to the point that members were briefing against each other in pretty venomous terms. Despite that, the exercise was so influential that it may be a long time before another government creates such an effective whip for its own back - and ministers certainly did not fancy setting up a second Parliamentary Commission, this time to review the future of the Civil Service, and the proposal was eventually fought to a standstill. It is no coincidence that Tyrie's statement announcing his departure noted that \\"stronger committees now demand better explanations for the decisions made by ministers, regulators, and quangos than hitherto.\\" And as chair of the super-committee of select committee chairs, the Commons Liaison Committee, he worked hard to underpin the new status and powers of the select committee system. He also tried to bring in a more exacting interrogation of the prime minister in the Liaison Committee's termly hearings with the PM, once provoking an exasperated David Cameron to shoot back at him: \\"You don't know what you're talking about\\" - as he probed the UK's involvement in the Syrian civil war. In a similar vein, Tyrie also led the all party parliamentary group on Rendition, which pursued evidence of UK complicity in the Bush administration's seizure of terrorist suspects. Never a minister, and only briefly a shadow minister, Tyrie arguably made his biggest mark on political history as a special advisor to Chancellor Norman Lamont - he had been drafted in on a temporary basis to help out at the Treasury, in the early months of John Major's premiership, and one of his final task was to recommend a successor. And his choice, on the basis that what was needed was less a policy advisor and more a spin doctor, was a bright young chap named David Cameron. The rest is history. A summary of the above article is?","output":"The article discusses the influential career of Andrew Tyrie, who chaired the Treasury select committee and led the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards.

During that time the students live in the wilderness and go through many physical activities of ever increasing difficulty. The first few days are given to physical conditioning and to the teaching of basic skills such as first aid, map and compass reading, rope climbing, and other similar activities. During the second part of the course students learn how to climb rocks and cliffs, how to use canoes and rafts in swift water, and in some schools how to sail, ski, climb mountains, and make long-distance hikes. The first two parts of the course are done in groups. Members work together and help each other to overcome the increasing number of challenges. In the third part of the course, students are sent out alone for three days to survive in the wilderness with only a few necessities. Who are the students of Outward Bound? They are both young people and adults, men and women. The minimum age is 16.5 years. There is no maximum age. About one-third of the 6,000 persons completing the course each year are women. Businessmen, housewives, university students, professors, doctors, and lawyers are among those taking part in the course. In recent years special courses for the busy business managers have gained in popularity. These courses last from five to ten days rather than the usual three to four weeks of the normal course. Not all students complete the Outward Bound course. In some cases the individual cannot meet the physical challenges. In its own words Outward Bound literature says: \\"Make no mistake, Outward Bound is not for everybody.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the title of the painting given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66? , can you please find it?   The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving nude by Velázquez, but three others by the artist are recorded in 17th-century Spanish inventories. Two were mentioned in the Royal collection, but may have been lost in the 1734 fire that destroyed the main Royal Palace of Madrid. A further one was recorded in the collection of Domingo Guerra Coronel. These records mention \\"a reclining Venus\\", Venus and Adonis, and a Psyche and Cupid.Although the work is widely thought to have been painted from life, the identity of the model is subject to much speculation. In contemporary Spain it was acceptable for artists to employ male nude models for studies; however, the use of female nude models was frowned upon. The painting is believed to have been executed during one of Velázquez's visits to Rome, and Prater has observed that in Rome the artist \\"did indeed lead a life of considerable personal liberty that would have been consistent with the notion of using a live nude female model\\". It has been claimed that the painting depicts a mistress Velázquez is known to have had while in Italy, who is supposed to have borne his child. Others have claimed that the model is the same as in Coronation of the Virgin and Las Hilanderas, both in the Museo del Prado, and other works.The figures of both Venus and Cupid were significantly altered during the painting process, the result of the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some...

It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.  - Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941  October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist. He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system. Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999. Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the \\"R\\" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username dmr.  - IMAGE (from Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), or Explorer 78, was a NASA MIDEX mission that studied the global response of the Earth's magnetosphere to changes in the solar wind. It was launched March 25, 2000 by a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg AFB and ceased operations in December 2005.  - Unix (trademarked as UNIX) is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, developed starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.  - Kenneth Lane \\"Ken\\" Thompson (born February 4, 1943), commonly referred to as ken in hacker circles, is an American pioneer of computer science. Having worked at Bell Labs for most of his career, Thompson designed and implemented the original Unix operating system. He also invented the B programming language, the direct predecessor to the C programming language, and was one of the creators and early developers of the Plan 9 operating systems. Since 2006, Thompson has worked at Google, where he co-invented the Go programming language.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms are written in terms of types \\"to-be-specified-later\\" that are then \\"instantiated\\" when needed for specific types provided as parameters. This approach, pioneered by ML in 1973, permits writing common functions or types that differ only in the set of types on which they operate when used, thus reducing duplication. Such software entities are known as \\"generics\\" in Ada, Delphi, Eiffel, Java, C#, F#, Objective-C, Swift, and Visual Basic .NET; \\"parametric polymorphism\\" in ML, Scala, Haskell (the Haskell community also uses the term \\"generic\\" for a related but somewhat different concept) and Julia; \\"templates\\" in C++ and D; and \\"parameterized types\\" in the influential 1994 book \\"Design Patterns\\".

The premise states that risks would be acceptably mitigated with a specific statistical sampling plan that provides a certain examination scope, sampling from all invoices under 2,500, effective monitoring, and a continuing relationship with the vendor. 2. Next, let's analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that \\"they did not foresee any risks.\\" 3. Now, let's compare the premise and the hypothesis. The premise is discussing how to mitigate risks, which implies that risks do exist and have been considered. In contrast, the hypothesis claims that no risks were foreseen. 4. Based on the comparison, we can see that the hypothesis contradicts the premise as the premise considers risks and provides ways to mitigate them, while the hypothesis suggests that risks were not foreseen.

In fact, ever since they had been roommates in college, Joseph had taken note of Derrick's fondness for the fluffy breakfast dish. Step 1: Understand the context of the text provided In this context, we have two people – Joseph and Derrick, who appear to be close friends. Joseph orders pancakes for Derrick as he is aware of his love for pancakes. Step 2: Expand upon the story with a fitting follow-up Having gathered some background context, we can now expand on the story:  Joseph remembered how on Saturdays, Derrick would wake up early just to make a fresh batch of pancakes from scratch. He always took care to make them fluffy and soft, with crispy golden edges. It was his way of unwinding after a long week of classes, assignments, and exams. As they sat laughing together around the small kitchen table in their college apartment, the smell of pancakes would fill the air, creating a cozy atmosphere that made their friendship grow stronger with each passing day.

He noticed that meats had two different packaging, product A and product B. When he looked closely, he found that in product A packaging carbon monoxide was used, but in product B carbon monoxide was not used. He asked the store clerk what difference it made.  Which product would less likely look fresher, product A or product B?","output":"To determine which product would less likely look fresher, let's examine the role of carbon monoxide in meat packaging and consider the effect it has on the appearance of the meat. Step 1: Research the purpose of carbon monoxide in meat packaging Carbon monoxide is used in some meat packaging to help maintain the red color of the meat by reacting with the myoglobin, which is the protein responsible for giving meat its red color. This process is called carboxymyoglobin formation. Step 2: Understand the effect of carbon monoxide on the appearance of meat By forming carboxymyoglobin, carbon monoxide helps the meat maintain a bright red color, which is typically associated with freshness. In the absence of carbon monoxide, the meat might turn brown or grayish due to oxidation, even if it is still good to eat. This color change, however, may lead consumers to believe that the meat is no longer fresh. Step 3: Compare product A and product B based on freshness appearance Product A uses carbon monoxide in its packaging, which means that it will likely maintain a bright red color for a longer period, appearing fresher. Product B does not use carbon monoxide, so the natural oxidation process may cause the meat to lose its red color, leading to the perception that it is not as fresh. Conclusion: Based on the role of carbon monoxide in preserving the red color of meat, product B, which does not use carbon monoxide in its packaging, would less likely look fresher compared to product A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: One of the most popular American singers of the twentieth century was Elvis Presley. He made the Rock & Roll music popular around the world. He sold millions of records and made many successful films, and he helped change the direction of popular music in the 1960s. Elvis Presley was born in a poor family in 1935. His parents were simple country people who often took him to church, where he learned to sing and he never forgot the kind of songs that he used to sing in church as a child. When he was a teenager, Elvis moved from Tupelos to Memphis in Tennessee, where he attended high school, but he was not a good student. His only real interest was singing. He began to sing in the style that is called \\"country and western\\". In 1955 he recorded some songs for his mother's birthday. The people at the recording studio liked his singing and his music. There was something different about it. It was country and western music, but it also sounded a little like the music, which black people used to sing in the American South, music known as \\"blues\\". Shortly after that, Elvis met Tom Parker, who became his manager and arranged concerts for him across the United States and new recordings as well. Soon Elvis rose to fame all over the country. Later, Elvis went to Hollywood and began to appear in films like Love Me Tender and King Creole. But Elvis found it hard to live with success, like many other entertainment personalities   .He began to take drugs and his health began to suffer. When he died at an early age of 42 in 1977, his many millions of fans were shocked. \\"The King Is Dead!\\" the newspaper said. But today his memory and his music live on and he will always be remembered as the King of Rock & Roll. Question: Judging from the passage, we may conclude  _   . Options: A: Elvis forgot his church music at a later age B: his church songs helped his development in his singing C: Elvis didn't get any help from his parents in singing D: his church songs didn't help develop his own style The answer to this question is:","output":"B: his church songs helped his development in his singing"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"heat can change something that has how many states?\\" is \\"two\\", given that  heat can change something that has three states? Answer:","output":"Heat, as a form of temperature or energy, has the potential to change the state of a substance. Generally, substances can exist in three different states: solid, liquid, and gas. These state transitions are primarily governed by changes in temperature, pressure, or both. The right answer to the question \\"Heat can change something that has how many states?\\" can be more accurately described as follows: Heat possesses the capacity to change substances with all three states - solid, liquid, and gas - as opposed to limiting the changes to only two states. The transitions between these states are known as phase changes or phase transitions. The primary phase changes involving heat include: 1. Melting: The transition from a solid to a liquid state, often resulting from the absorption of heat energy. A substance’s melting point is the temperature at which this transition occurs, provided that the pressure remains constant. 2. Freezing: The transition from a liquid to a solid state, usually caused by the release of heat energy. A substance’s freezing point refers to the temperature at which this transition happens under constant pressure.  3. Vaporization: The change from a liquid to a gas state, which comprises evaporation and boiling. This phase change requires the absorption of heat energy, and it occurs when the substance reaches its boiling point at a fixed pressure level. 4. Condensation: The transformation from a gas to a liquid state, typically due to a reduction in temperature or increase in pressure. This transition involves the release of heat energy. 5. Sublimation: The direct conversion from a solid to a gas state without passing through the liquid phase. Sublimation requires the absorption of heat energy and occurs at specific temperature and pressure conditions. 6. Deposition: The direct transition from a gas to a solid state without becoming a liquid. This change involves the release of heat energy. In conclusion, it is more accurate to say that heat can change something with three states – solid, liquid, and gas – rather than attributing the changes to only two states. Heat energy has the potential to facilitate various phase transitions across all three states, under the right temperature and pressure conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The Very Rev Dr Sandy McDonald, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from 1997-98, had been fighting the degenerative lung disease pulmonary fibrosis. He died at the Erskine Care Home in Bishopton, Renfrewshire on Thursday. Current Moderator, the Rt Rev Dr Angus Morrison, said: \\"Dr Sandy McDonald was a wonderful man and minister.\\" He added: \\"Genuine love for people was a defining mark of his ministry. \\"He had a special concern for the well-being, at every level, of his fellow ministers. Sandy's memory will be cherished by many.\\" He is survived by three children, including Doctor Who and Broadchurch star Tennant, who was born in Bathgate, West Lothian. Tennant is understood to have taken his stage name from the Pet Shop Boys frontman Neil Tennant after reading a copy of Smash Hits magazine. Dr McDonald was described by colleagues as a \\"beloved figure, widely admired for his fearlessness, generosity and irrepressible high spirits\\". In the 1980s he co-presented religious programme That's The Spirit on STV, and once appeared with Tennant as a guest on cookery show Ready Steady Cook. He also took on a cameo role alongside his son in an episode of Doctor Who in 2008. Following his diagnosis, he spoke out in favour of the right to die of terminally ill people, contrary to the Kirk's official position on the issue. Former Kirk moderator the Very Rev John Chalmers said: \\"Working with Sandy McDonald was one of the great pleasures of my career in ministry. \\"It was no surprise to me when Sandy called for a serious dialogue on the right to die - he was a man who tempered his views in the light of reality, he was a man who sat lightly to dogma and who preferred faith in action. \\"The Church of Scotland needs a new breed of Sandy McDonalds who catch a passion for the good news of Jesus Christ, but whose understanding of the faith is not frozen in time, but develops and matures with new revelation and understanding.\\" Dr McDonald was born in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire, in 1937 and trained for the ministry after national service with the Royal Air Force. He served at St David's Parish Church in Bathgate, and St Mark's Parish Church in Ralston, Renfrewshire, and then as general secretary of the Church of Scotland's board of ministry until he retired in 2002. Helen, his wife of more than 40 years, died in 2007. Friend the Very Rev Dr Lorna Hood said: \\"Sandy didn't just preach. He put his whole self into it - his arms, his voice, his whole body went into his sermons. \\"People loved it when he preached. He was a great pastor and he held parish ministry at the heart of the Church.\\" Summary:","output":"The Very Rev Dr Sandy McDonald, a former Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, has passed away after battling pulmonary fibrosis.

Answer: Grassland in the Santa Rosa Plateau , California . Question: what are they like in tropical grassland in plant Answer:","output":"Tropical grasslands, also known as savannas, are characterized by a mixture of grasses and scattered trees with a warm climate and pronounced wet and dry seasons. The tropical grasslands support a wide variety of plant life, including: 1. Grasses: The dominant vegetation in tropical grasslands consists of grasses, which can vary in height from a few inches to over 15 feet, depending on species and environmental conditions. Some common grasses found in tropical grasslands are elephant grass, bluestem, and various species of lovegrass. 2. Trees: Scattered trees, often with flat crowns and deep roots, are also commonly found in tropical grasslands. These trees are usually deciduous, meaning they lose their leaves during the dry season to conserve water. Acacia, baobab, and eucalyptus trees are some examples of trees that can be found in these ecosystems. 3. Shrubs and Forbs: In addition to grasses and trees, tropical grasslands also support various species of shrubs and forbs. These plants are adapted to the alternating wet and dry climate of tropical grasslands and often have deep roots and other strategies to survive during the dry season. 4. Epiphytes and Climbing Plants: Some plants have adapted to the tropical grassland environment by living on or climbing up trees and larger shrubs. Examples include orchids, ferns, and lianas (woody vines). Overall, the plant life in tropical grasslands exhibits a substantial amount of biodiversity due to the diverse range of adaptations necessary for survival in an environment with distinct wet and dry seasons.

French leaders, such as Louis XIV and Napoleon Bonaparte, tried with varying degrees of success to annex lands west of the Rhine. The Confederation of the Rhine was established by Napoleon, as a French client state, in 1806 and lasted until 1814, during which time it served as a significant source of resources and military manpower for the First French Empire.

Title: Another Earth Movie plot: Rhoda Williams (Brit Marling) is a high school student who has been recently accepted to MIT. She celebrates with friends and drives home intoxicated. Listening to a story about an approaching planet that looks just like Earth on the radio, she looks out her car window up to the stars and inadvertly slams her car through a stopped car at an intersection, putting John Burroughs (William Mapother) in a coma and killing his wife and son. Rhoda is a minor, so her identity is not revealed to John. After serving her prison sentence, Rhoda does not go to MIT, but becomes a janitor at a local school, wanting to physically clean things with her hands but not do too much thinking.After cleaning a school for a while and hearing more news stories about the approaching mirror Earth, Rhoda visits John's house after he has recovered, thinking she will apologize for the harm she did to him. He answers the door and she loses her nerve. Instead, she pretends to be a maid offering a free day of cleaning as a marketing tool for Maid'n Haven (a New Haven based maid service). John, who has nearly dropped out of his Yale music faculty position and is now living in a depressed and dirty stupor, agrees to Rhoda's offer. When she finishes, John, who still does not know she is the person who killed his wife and son, asks her to come back next week. Rhoda tells him someone will come, but it may not be her.Rhoda returns to clean and develops a caring relationship with John that eventually becomes more significant and romantic. They like each other and are intelligent and compatible conversationally. Rhoda genuinely wants to be of service to him.Rhoda enters an essay contest sponsored by a millionaire entrepreneur who is offering a civilian space flight to the approaching mirror Earth. Rhoda's essay is selected and she is chosen to be one of the first explorers to travel to the other Earth. Rhoda tells John she has won the space flight, but he asks her not to go.

Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more.

Summarize this article: The deal proposes that the merged company will maintain Allergan's Irish domicile, allowing Pfizer to escape relatively high US corporate tax rates. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential candidate, accused Pfizer of avoiding its \\"fair share\\" of taxes. The deal would \\"leave US taxpayers holding the bag\\", she said. Senator Bernie Sanders, another Democratic hopeful, said the deal would be a disaster for consumers and allow another major US company to hide its profits overseas. Democratic representative Rosa DeLauro was also critical, saying: \\"We cannot continue to allow Pfizer and other corporations to pretend that they are American while reaping the benefits this country has to offer, yet claiming to be another nationality when the tax bill comes,\\" she said. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump described Pfizer's departure from the US as \\"disgusting\\", adding: \\"Our politicians should be ashamed.\\" If approved, the deal would be the biggest example of so-called inversion, where a US firm merges with a company in a country with a lower tax rate and moves its headquarters there. In Ireland, the corporate tax rate is 12.5%, compared with the 35% Pfizer currently pays in the US. Pfizer boss Ian Read said the savings from the deal would give it \\"the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and more therapies to more people around the world\\". Last year, Pfizer made a takeover move for rival AstraZeneca, which analysts said was designed to reduce Pfizer's tax bill. The UK drugs firm rejected the bid. The White House has so far declined to comment on the deal. But US President Barack Obama has previously called such inversion deals unpatriotic and has tried to crack down on the practice. Last week, the US Treasury Department unveiled new rules to clamp down on inversions, but tax experts said the change would  not be sufficient to prevent the deal completing. Yet, investors appear uncertain the deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval in the US and Europe, will get the go-ahead. Shares in Pfizer closed down 2.7% in New York at 31.32, while Allergan fell 3.4% to 301.70.","output":"There is a big company called Pfizer which makes medicines. They want to join with another company called Allergan. Both companies are very big and joining them will make one even bigger company. The new larger company would be in Ireland because the taxes there are lower than in the United States. Some people, like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, are not happy about this. They think Pfizer should stay in the United States and pay more taxes.

Here is a news article: Former Star journalist Natasha Stoynoff says Donald Trump sexually assaulted her while she was writing a feature about his and Melania's first wedding anniversary. ( Twitter image )      A Toronto-based professor and writer is backing former Toronto Star journalist Natasha Stoynoff who has accused Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in 2005, while she was on assignment for People magazine. Paul McLaughlin says Stoynoff is telling the truth — and that her story hasn’t changed since she first told him about it shortly after the alleged attack. “The reason I’m speaking about this — and it is with her blessing, by the way — is that she is being accused by a man running for the presidency of the United States of being a complete liar, of fabricating a story about something that for her was quite horrible,” he said. Stoynoff did not respond to the Star’s requests for comment. “Now (Trump’s) got to say that I’m a liar, too, and I’m not. I’m telling the truth,” said McLaughlin, who recalled Stoynoff being deeply disturbed by her encounter with Trump.      Article Continued Below      “It really shook her and she didn’t know what to do, and among the people that she would turn to, I was one that she would call and ask for advice and that’s what she did,” said McLaughlin, a former journalism professor at Ryerson University who now teaches at the York University. McLaughlin said he told her not to go public with her accusation at the time, in order to protect her career. “Here he is with his very pregnant wife in an adjacent room; he is not the type of person who is going to admit what he did. And I thought that because there was no evidence other than her word versus his word that he could easily turn around and accuse her of hitting on him and he could destroy her career,” McLaughlin recalled.      RELATED: Woman says Trump sexually assaulted her at a Manhattan nightspot in the ’90s Donald Trump responds with fury to sexual assault allegations A look at Donald Trump’s accusers “What saddens me more is that someone of Donald Trump’s prominence is waging war against a young, talented, writer and saying things he knows are 100-per-cent wrong,” he said. “He knows he is not telling what happened accurately and I just … it seems to be a pattern with him.” On Wednesday, Stoynoff published her story online in People. She wrote that when travelling to visit Donald and Melania Trump to write a feature about the couple’s first wedding anniversary, Trump “shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat.” Stoynoff wrote that Melania, who was pregnant at the time, was changing upstairs in preparation for a photo shoot. Trump has denied the allegations and tweeted a suggestion that the story was made up: “Why didn’t the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the ‘incident’ in her story. Because it did not happen!” he wrote. McLaughlin said Stoynoff, who was a student of his when he taught journalism at Ryerson University, called him, upset, shortly after it happened , and that he stayed in touch with her over the years. This week, Stoynoff is one of several women who have gone public with allegations that Trump sexually assaulted them. This follows a leaked video from 2005 that show Trump bragging about groping and kissing women without their consent. McLaughlin didn’t know Stoynoff was going to go public with her story before she did this week, but said he recognized her story when he read it. He said it is the same as the one she told him years ago. “I think that it’s terrible that she had to go through that. That someone who she thought admired her work turned on her that way, and destroyed what was a good professional relationship,” McLaughlin said. “Not only do I have compassion for Natasha but for anyone who has gone through this in their life.” McLaughlin said if he could go back in time, he’d stand by what he told Stoynoff. He thinks she made the right choice in no longer covering Trump. In her published account of what happened, Stoynoff said she only told a few close friends and family about her experience in Mar-a-Lago. “In time, I chalked it up to one of the hazards of a roller-coaster ride of celebrity journalism: I’d danced barefoot in Cannes with John Travolta, sang with Paul McCartney, talked about Bogie with Bacall, quoted Shakespeare with Brando and Prince Andrew yelled at me until I cried,” Stoynoff wrote. “Oh, and Donald Trump forced himself on me. I tried to make myself believe it was no big deal. “Now he’s running for president of our country.” Correction – October 17, 2016: This article was edited from a previous version that mistakenly said Paul McLaughlin is currently a professor at the University of Toronto.

Among them is a friend who was with Stoynoff when she ran into Melania Trump later in N.Y.C.      The wife of the Republican nominee denies meeting Stoynoff after the attack, but Stoynoff’s friend Liza Herz remembers being there during the chance meeting.      Get push notifications with news, features and more.      “They chatted in a friendly way,” Herz, who met Stoynoff in college, says. “And what struck me most was that Melania was carrying a child and wearing heels.”      Stoynoff’s story, which made national news when it broke last week and is reprinted in this week’s issue of PEOPLE, describes a run-in with Trump when she was covering him and pregnant wife Melania on assignment for PEOPLE in December 2005.      “We walked into that room alone, and Trump shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat,” she writes.      Trump vigorously denies the story and later attacked Stoynoff on the campaign trail, saying, “She lies! Look at her, I don’t think so.”      Stoynoff describes meeting Melania later year: “I actually bumped into Melania on Fifth Avenue, in front of Trump Tower as she walked into the building, carrying baby Barron. ‘Natasha, why don’t we see you anymore?’ she asked, giving me a hug.”      Natasha Stoyoff (second from left) with Donald Trump and Melania Trump at Mar-a-Lago with the PEOPLE photo crew in December 2005 // Troy Word Troy Word      Natasha Stoynoff for PEOPLE // Melanie Acevedo Melanie Acevedo      In a CNN interview with Anderson Cooper on Monday, Melania denied the encounter ever took place.      “The story that came out in PEOPLE magazine, the writer she said my husband took her to the room and started kissing her, she wrote in the same story about me that she saw me on Fifth Avenue, and I said to her ‘Natasha, how come we don’t see you anymore?’ I was never friends with her, I would not recognize her,” she told CNN.      PEOPLE Editor in Chief Jess Cagle says in a statement about Stoynoff’s piece, “In this week’s issue of PEOPLE (which hits newsstands in New York on Wednesday), we feature a story that includes named sources who can corroborate Natasha Stoynoff’s account – including one woman (a friend of Natasha’s) who was actually with her when she bumped into Melania Trump on Fifth Ave., as outlined in her story.”      Watch the full episode of People Features: Why I Spoke Up About Trump, available now on the new People/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN).

Five other witnesses also back up Stoynoff’s account of her encounter with Trump:      Marina Grasic, who has known Stoynoff for more than 25 years, says she got a call from her friend the day after the attack. Stoynoff detailed everything about the attack, from Trump pushing her against a wall to the business mogul showing up at her massage appointment the following day, she says.      According to Grasic, her longtime friend was embarrassed and even thought of Trump’s then-pregnant wife when deciding not to come forward about the encounter.      “Natasha was also struggling about not hurting pregnant Melania if the story came out,” Grasic says. “Beyond just the attack, she was horrified by the vulgar circumstances under which she was attacked and propositioned to have an affair. She was there in a professional capacity, writing an article about their happy marriage, and after the incident Trump acted like nothing happened.            “She was particularly concerned that if he was capable of such behavior, what else was he capable of? Certainly character assassination by a powerful man was of great concern to her, which seems warranted in light of what Trump is saying about her this week. She ultimately decided to stay quiet but be taken off the Trump beat.”      Stoynoff’s former journalism professor, Paul McLaughlin, says that the writer called him in tears looking for advice the very night of the harrowing encounter. However, he cautioned her to remain quiet in fear of how Trump may retaliate.      Gregory Pace/FilmMagic Gregory Pace/FilmMagic      “She wasn’t sure what she should do,” McLaughlin recalls. “I advised her not to say anything, because I believed Trump would deny it and try to destroy her.”      “It was tough decision but in a he said/she said we believed she would lose,” the professor said in a tweet regarding the incident. “He seemed rather nasty at the time.”      PEOPLE East Coast Editor Liz McNeil was one colleague Stoynoff confided in about the incident. McNeil remembers the day she returned from the assignment in Florida to cover Trump and his wife’s first anniversary.      “She was very upset and told me how he shoved her against a wall,” says McNeil.      She adds, “The thing I remember most was how scared she was. I felt I had to protect her.”      Deputy East Coast News Editor Mary Green returned to PEOPLE’s New York-based staff in December 2005 after a three-year hiatus excited to reconnect with Stoynoff. However, Stoynoff was haunted by her recent experience, and she opened up to Green about the encounter.      “In an early conversation we had in her office, she told me about what happened with Donald Trump,” Green said. “She was shaky, sitting at her desk, relaying that, ‘He took me to this other room, and when we stepped inside, he pushed me against a wall and stuck his tongue down my throat. Melania was upstairs and could have walked in at any time.’      “She talked about her shock, and wondered why it had happened, if she had done anything wrong. I assured her she hadn’t. She was also angry that he had forced himself on her, that she was glad someone had interrupted him, because he was surprisingly strong.”      Another coworker who knew about the attack was Liza Hamm, who was friends with McNeil and others in a “tight-knit group” that Stoynoff opened up to.      “Natasha has always been a vivacious person who wants to believe in the best of people, and this experience definitely messed with that outlook,” Hamm says. “But she is also a consummate professional. She told me that she asked to be taken off the Trump beat, but she tried her best to move past the experience and continue to do her job well.”      Stoynoff says she knew she was opening herself up for criticism when she decided to share her story, but she’s staying strong.      “I am doing okay,” she says in the new issue of PEOPLE.      In the past week, multiple women have come out with similar claims of sexual assault against the 70-year-old Republican presidential candidate.      Stoynoff admits there’s a chance Trump simply pushed her own incident from his mind.      “It’s possible he just doesn’t remember it,” Stoynoff says. “It was over 10 years ago and I assume I am one of many, many women.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Former Toronto Star journalist Natasha Stoynoff has accused Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in 2005 while she was on assignment for People magazine, covering the first wedding anniversary of Donald and Melania Trump.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two neighboring countries had health epidemics. While Ghana had a measles problem, Niger had a very serious HIV problem that seemed to get out of control.  But I can use this background: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/ .  What is an answer for this question: Which country had more people at risk of getting AIDS? Answer:","output":"In order to answer the question of which country had more people at risk of getting AIDS, let's consider the factors mentioned in the background information provided and the given situation. Step 1: Analyze the given situation Ghana is facing a measles problem, while Niger is having a very serious HIV problem that seems to be getting out of control. Step 2: Understand the transmission of HIV HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, including blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It can also be passed from mother to fetus. Step 3: Estimate the populations at risk within each country To determine which country had more people at risk of getting AIDS, we must consider the populations affected by the respective epidemics within each country. Since we do not have specific numbers for each country, we can use the given information to make an educated assumption. Given that Niger is currently experiencing a very serious HIV problem that seems to be getting out of control, we can assume that a significant portion of the population is at risk of getting AIDS. On the other hand, Ghana is primarily dealing with a measles outbreak rather than an HIV epidemic. Thus, the percentage of the population at risk of getting AIDS in Ghana may be lower, based on the information provided. Step 4: Compare risk levels in each country Based on the information provided and the relative severity of the HIV epidemic in Niger, it is reasonable to assume that the population at risk of getting AIDS is higher in Niger than in Ghana. Answer: In this situation, Niger has more people at risk of getting AIDS than Ghana."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What are the names of the two religious university campuses in Canberra?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The two main tertiary institutions are the Australian National University (ANU) in Acton and the University of Canberra (UC) in Bruce, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively. Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available.

Process: - Owls have specially adapted eyes that see better at night - Owls sit at high points in trees and look around - When an owl spots a rodent they track it - When the rodent is standing still the owl swoops down - The owl grabs the rodent with their tallons - The owl uses their beak to eat the rodent.  Question: suppose less air pollution produced happens, how will it affect more owls see rodents.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"More Air pollution can significantly impact the ability of owls to see rodents, which form an essential part of their diet. If there is less air pollution produced, it will improve the overall visibility for owls and enhance their ability to spot and hunt rodents effectively. First, let's understand the relationship between air pollution and owls' vision. Air pollution, particularly in the form of particulate matter, can scatter light, making it difficult for owls to see their prey clearly. This is especially true in low light conditions, which is when owls are most active, as their specially adapted eyes allow them to see better at night. With reduced air pollution, the air will be less dense with particulate matter, thereby reducing light scattering. The improved visibility will provide several benefits to the owls in their hunting process, as mentioned below: 1. Increased visibility while scanning for prey: Owls typically sit at high points in trees and look around for prey, such as rodents. With less air pollution, the owls will have a wider and more transparent field of view, increasing their chances of spotting a rodent. 2. Enhanced tracking ability: Once an owl spots a rodent, it needs to track the movement of the rodent. Reduced air pollution allows the owl to follow the rodent with greater clarity and precision to time its attack accurately. 3. More successful swoops: When the rodent is standing still or moving slowly, the owl swoops down to catch it. Improved visibility ensures that the owl can better judge its swooping trajectory, thereby increasing the chances of a successful capture. 4. Less energy expenditure: With more successful hunts, owls will need to expend less energy searching for and capturing prey, which would also have a net-positive effect on their overall health and population. In conclusion, if less air pollution is produced, it will have a positive effect on owls, as they will be able to see and catch rodents more effectively. This, in turn, can lead to an increase in the owl population due to better access to their primary food source, which is essential for their survival and reproduction."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive?

A:","output":"The genus of the grizzly bear, also known as Ursus arctos, is Ursus. This genus belongs to the family Ursidae, which includes a variety of bear species. Ursus is derived from the Latin word for \\"bear\\" and it currently features eight living species that showcase a diverse range of adaptations, sizes, and distributions across the world. Ursus originated during the late Miocene epoch, approximately 5 to 10 million years ago. Since then, the genus has evolved and adapted to different environments, leading to the varied species we see today. Among these species, you can find prominent members such as the American black bear (Ursus americanus), the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), and the brown bear (Ursus arctos). The grizzly bear is a subspecies of Ursus arctos and is often referred to as the North American brown bear, as it is native to the continent. It ranges from Alaska down to the western parts of the United States and Canada. They are omnivorous creatures with an impressive ability to survive and adapt to different habitats. Grizzly bears can be found in forests, alpine meadows, coastal areas, and even arctic tundra environments. Grizzly bears are distinguishable from other Ursus species due to their physical characteristics and behavior. They have a distinct hump on their shoulders that is primarily composed of muscle, as well as a concave facial profile and longer, straighter claws compared to those of the American black bear. Grizzlies are typically larger than black bears, with adult males weighing from 300 to 860 pounds (135 to 390 kilograms) and females weighing between 200 and 450 pounds (90 to 200 kilograms). In terms of behavior, grizzlies are quite adaptable, proficient swimmers, and skillful hunters. Their diet is diverse, including a wide variety of plants, berries, insects, fish, and mammals (such as moose, elk, and deer). They are also known to be resourceful, utilizing carrion as a food source when available. This adaptability has contributed to their survival in a range of environments and habitats. In conclusion, the genus of the grizzly bear, Ursus arctos, is Ursus. This genus features a diverse range of bear species that have adapted to different environments across the world. Grizzly bears, as a subspecies of Ursus arctos, showcase unique characteristics and behaviors that set them apart from other members of their genus and underline their status as powerful and adaptable creatures."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Eleven rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza on Thursday, a day after a fatal terrorist bombing in Jerusalem killed a woman and wounded more than 50 other people, the Israel Defense Forces said. \\"The question is why,\\" Brig. Gen. Yossi Kuperwasser said in a phone call Thursday, speaking about the increase in attacks, which the IDF said caused no injuries. Israel's ambassador to the United States said Thursday the rocket attacks appear \\"unrelated\\" to Wednesday's bombing in Jerusalem. Michael Oren said the rocket attacks probably have to do with infighting in the Hamas-controlled territory of Gaza. However, he said, there has also been an escalation in violence against his country. \\"Israel has been under attack on several fronts,\\" Oren said, also citing the recent murder of an Israeli family in the West Bank. One of the rockets fired Thursday hit near the southern Israeli town of Ashdod, and another landed in the southern town of Sderot, causing damage to an industrial area of the town, according to Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. In response to the rocket attacks, the Israeli military launched airstrikes in Gaza on Thursday night. Two were in the Beit Hanoun area of northern Gaza and two were in Gaza City, according to journalist Ibrahim Dahman. A Hamas building and a Hamas training camp were hit, he reported. Kuperwasser said Thursday night's strikes were aimed at trying to prevent more attacks on Israel. \\"Right now there is no one in Gaza to stop this, so it's up to us to try to stop it,\\" he said. \\"It seems no one speaks for the Palestinians,\\" he added. \\"Hamas is not in charge.\\" There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the Jerusalem attack, which was caused by a medium-sized device in a bag that had been left near Jerusalem's central bus station as the evening rush hour began. Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs named the woman who died as Mary Jane Gardner, a 59-year-old British national who was studying at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Israeli officials were continuing their investigation into Wednesday's attack, Kuperwasser said, without giving details. U.S. President Barack Obama called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to express his condolences over the Jerusalem bombing and his concern about the attacks against Israel from Gaza, the White House said in a statement. Obama \\"reaffirmed the United States' unwavering commitment to Israel's security,\\" it said. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates also paid a visit to Israel on Thursday. He met with his Israeli counterpart, Ehud Barak, who said Israel will not \\"tolerate\\" terrorist attacks. British Foreign Secretary William Hague also spoke out against the attack, calling it \\"a callous and disgusting act of terrorism directed against innocent civilians which I condemn unreservedly.\\" The Palestinian Authority also condemned the attack, but Oren, the Israeli ambassador, criticized their comments. They \\"say one thing\\" and \\"do another thing,\\" he said. He said prominent members of the Palestinian government recently attended a ceremony at a central square near Ramallah that was named after a \\"Palestinian terrorist who killed dozens of Israelis, including about 13 children.\\" \\"The message gets out that killing Israelis is a good thing,\\" Oren said. \\"We need to see not just words, but deeds.\\" CNN's Charley Keyes, Michal Zippori, Paul Colsey, and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.

Let's think of this like we're just moving blocks around. So, we have blocks on both sides of the equal sign, right? On the left side, we have -72541 blocks of the letter 'c'. And on the right, we have -74144 blocks of 'c' and some extra 176330 blocks. So, the first thing we want to do is to have 'c' boxes on just one side. To do this, let's take -74144 blocks of 'c' from the right side and put it on the left side, making it +74144 because when we move it across the equals sign, things change sign (minus becomes plus and vice versa). So the left side will now have -72541 'c' + 74144 'c' = 1603 'c' (because 74144 - 72541 equals 1603). As for the right side, we are only left with the extra 176330 blocks. So now we have 1603 blocks of 'c' equals to 176330 blocks. But we want only 1 block of 'c', not 1603! So, let's divide 176330 blocks by 1603.  When we do that, we find that each 'c' block is around 110. So, 'c' equals to 110!

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The chemical reactions that regulate the levels of CO2 and carbonic acid occur in the lungs when blood travels through the lung’s pulmonary capillaries. Minor adjustments in breathing are usually sufficient to adjust the pH of the blood by changing how much CO2 is exhaled. In fact, doubling the respiratory rate for less than 1 minute, removing “extra” CO2, would increase the blood pH by 0.2. This situation is common if you are exercising strenuously over a period of time. To keep up the necessary energy production, you would produce excess CO2 (and lactic acid if exercising beyond your aerobic threshold). In order to balance the increased acid production, the respiration rate goes up to remove the CO2. This helps to keep you from developing acidosis. The body regulates the respiratory rate by the use of chemoreceptors, which primarily use CO2 as a signal. Peripheral blood sensors are found in the walls of the aorta and carotid arteries. These sensors signal the brain to provide immediate adjustments to the respiratory rate if CO2 levels rise or fall. Yet other sensors are found in the brain itself. Changes in the pH of CSF affect the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata, which can directly modulate breathing rate to bring the pH back into the normal range. Hypercapnia, or abnormally elevated blood levels of CO2, occurs in any situation that impairs respiratory functions, including pneumonia and congestive heart failure. Reduced breathing (hypoventilation) due to drugs such as morphine, barbiturates, or ethanol (or even just holding one’s breath) can also result in hypercapnia. Hypocapnia, or abnormally low blood levels of CO2, occurs with any cause of hyperventilation that drives off the CO2, such as salicylate toxicity, elevated room temperatures, fever, or hysteria.   Choices:  - spirogyra  - hepatitis  - trichina  - hypocapnia   A: Answer:","output":"Hypocapnia"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In 1975, Sadat shifted Nasser's economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his program of Infitah. Through this policy, incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors, but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction, abandoning Egypt's infant industries. Even though Sadat's policy was intended to modernise Egypt and assist the middle class, it mainly benefited the higher class, and, because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs, led to the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots. What occured in 1977?","output":"In 1977, Egypt experienced a significant event known as the Egyptian Bread Riots, which were a series of protests and civil unrest in response to the government's decision to eliminate subsidies on basic foodstuffs. The riots occurred from 18th to 19th of January, and were driven by widespread discontent among the population, as a result of economic challenges and growing inequality in the country. The 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots took place in the context of President Anwar Sadat’s economic policy, known as Infitah or Open Door policy. This policy, initiated in 1975, aimed to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment by offering incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs. However, the investments primarily focused on low-risk, profitable ventures in tourism and construction, neglecting the needs of Egypt's infant industries. This strategy resulted in a gradual deterioration of the socio-economic situation, further widening the gap between the rich and the poor. To qualify for loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, the Egyptian government was required to implement a series of austerity measures, which included the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs such as bread, flour, and cooking oil. This decision directly affected low-income families, who relied heavily on these subsidized goods to meet their basic needs. On January 18, 1977, the Egyptian government announced the removal of these subsidies, sparking immediate protests and demonstrations in major cities, including Cairo and Alexandria. The protests quickly escalated into violent riots, with people looting shops, setting fire to buildings and cars, and clashing with security forces. The unrest led to the deaths of approximately 79 people, while many others were injured or arrested. The severity of the Bread Riots sent shockwaves through both the Egyptian government and the international community, forcing President Sadat to reassess his economic policies. On January 20th, 1977, just two days after the riots began, Sadat announced the reinstatement of the food subsidies in an attempt to quell the unrest. The Egyptian Bread Riots of 1977 exposed the widening economic and social disparities in the country and underlined the urgent need for a more equitable development strategy. Though the government reversed its policy on the food subsidies immediately after the riots, the legacy of the events would have a lasting impact on Egyptian society, challenging the government's approach to economic reforms and highlighting the importance of social stability. Consequently, the Bread Riots serve as an emblematic example of the consequences of poorly planned economic policies and the precarious balance between progress and social cohesion in developing nations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Q: What organism is characterized by an incomplete digestive system and a single, tentacled opening?    Choices:  - annelids  - prokaryotes  - sponges  - cnidarians  A: A:","output":"Cnidarians are the organisms characterized by an incomplete digestive system and a single, tentacled opening.  Cnidarians are a group of simple aquatic invertebrates that include sea anemones, jellyfish, hydras, and corals. They have two main body forms: the polyp (a sessile, cylindrical-shaped body with a mouth at the top surrounded by tentacles) and the medusa (a free-swimming, bell-shaped body with a mouth and tentacles beneath).  Their incomplete digestive system, also known as a gastrovascular cavity or a blind sac, serves both as a digestive and circulatory system. This means that their single opening functions as both the entrance for food and the exit for waste. The tentacles surrounding the opening contain specialized cells, called cnidocytes, which are used to capture and paralyze prey with their stinging structures, called nematocysts. Here is a brief overview of other mentioned organisms: - Annelids: A group of segmented worms such as earthworms, leeches, and marine worms. They have a complete digestive system with a separate mouth and anus. - Prokaryotes: Single-celled microorganisms that lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Emma Reynolds and Rupert Steiner. PUBLISHED:. 03:30 EST, 6 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 03:58 EST, 6 November 2012. Fat cats at Britain's top companies have defied the financial crisis and awarded themselves pay rises that take average earnings to £4million. While their basic salaries have remained roughly the same, FTSE-100 company bosses have benefited from an enormous 27 per cent increase in income thanks to incentive schemes. News of their sky-high earnings will frustrate ordinary workers struggling to cope with austerity measures while those at the top continue to enjoy a 'champagne lifestyle'. Well-off: The highest-paid executives in Britain's biggest companies are hardly feeling the pinch, thanks to incentive schemes. The steep increase, revealed by Incomes Data Services, is also likely to anger investors who have seen the value of their holdings slashed by disappointing performances at corporate giants. The value of long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) rose by an average of 81 per cent to £938,000 for directors and £1.6m for chief executives in the year to June, said the IDS report. Directors' pay increased by a median of 3.5 per cent, while the value of their bonuses fell by 4.9 per cent, the study found. But this deficit was made up by incentive schemes, which are now used by more than 90 per cent of FTSE-100 firms. LTIPs are usually granted in the form of shares and are closely linked to shareholder returns, with directors typically having to reach a minimum target before any shares are granted. Backlash: The top earners at FTSE-100 firms were Angela Ahrendts of Burberry on £15.9m, left, and WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell on £14m, right. However, LTIPs are based on comparative performance with competitors, rather than a company's historical performance, so directors may be paid even if their company's performance has worsened, IDS revealed. 'Whether a reaction to Government pressure, shareholder concerns or a worse than expected business environment, it seems the brakes have been applied to the basic pay growth for FTSE-100 bosses,' said Steve Tatton of IDS. 'However, while shareholders will be pleased to see more traditional elements of pay seemingly slowing, these figures show that directors' earnings can still grow significantly as a result of a complex mix of incentives.' TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber added: 'Directors have proved that executive pay structures are not fit-for-purpose by securing another huge earnings boost, even while ordinary workers suffer flat or even falling wages. Lucrative year: Shell CEO Peter Voser, left, and CEO of Jupiter Edward Bonham Carter, right, both made £10.4m. 'An 81 per cent increase in long-term incentive plans when the economy is struggling to climb out of a double-dip recession shows just how flawed the so-called performance elements of directors' remuneration have become. 'We still have way to go to bring a sense of reality to executive pay and ensure that directors' pay is aligned with the long-term health of the company rather than simply its share price.' Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: 'While millions of working people are either without work, or having their pay frozen or slashed, Britain's boardrooms are finding even more devious ways to squeeze more cash from their companies. 'Wages for many working people have stagnated since 2003 and have fallen in real terms since the recession hit. Scalps: Former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond, left, and ex-Trinity Mirror boss Sly Bailey, right, left their companies in disgrace this year after rebellions from shareholders and the public. 'But the richest have continued to pull ahead. The top 10 per cent have 12 times more income than the bottom 10 per cent. Scandalously, Britain has the fastest growing income inequality compared to other developed countries. 'What is particularly sickening is that some of the companies may be performing poorly - but the cash registers are always ringing for these directors.' 'Flawed': TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said directors' pay should be aligned with the long-term health of the company. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'The Government is guilty of allowing the gap between the rich at the top and those at the bottom to grow. It has used the recession to hold down wages in the public sector and cut jobs and services, while those at the top continue to enjoy a champagne lifestyle. 'It is clearly ridiculous that taxpayers are landed with a bill of between £6bn and £7bn a year for in-work benefits because scrooge bosses are lining their own pockets.' Shareholders have fought back against excessive pay this year in an extraordinary show of strength, with the so-called ‘shareholder spring’ claiming senior scalps including Andrew Moss, chief executive of insurance giant Aviva, and Trinity Mirror’s Sly Bailey. Yet surviving senior managers are only seeing increase in their pay packets. The top earner was Angela Ahrendts, chief. executive of Burberry, which has just issued a profit warning but paid. Ahrendts £15.9m. WPP’s Sir Martin Sorrell, who suffered one of the biggest shareholder revolts on pay in recent history, was second with £14.2m. Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘At a time of biting austerity for the economy, those at the top of our biggest companies are seeing their pay continue to increase sharply compared to everyone else. ‘The gap between rewards in the boardroom and those for the rest of society has opened up to unsustainable levels. Shareholders have tried to rein in some of the worst excesses this year, but this has only been partially successful.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article is talking about how really rich people, particularly those who are leaders of really big companies in the UK, have been giving themselves more money even when the rest of the country is going through hard times financially. This pay rise increased their average earnings to £4 million. Even though their basic salaries stayed quite the same, these big bosses from top 100 companies in the stock exchange have seen a big increase of 27 per cent in their income due to special reward plans. Some people are upset because business folks are still able to live a fancy life, drink expensive champagne, while normal workers are having a tough time. Also, some people who have invested money in these big companies are upset because they have lost money due to the companies not doing as well as expected. These special reward plans, called long-term incentive plans (LTIPs), are often given in the form of shares and are linked to the returns made by shareholders. To get any shares, the bosses usually have to reach a certain target.  It is also mentioned that bosses can still get paid even if their company's performance has worsened, which might be seen as unfair by some. So, this article is mainly about a discussion on how the big bosses are giving themselves a big pay rise while many people are struggling financially during tough times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is through earnest and consistent efforts towards shaping these aspects that I believe we can realize this noble goal. As a politician, my primary responsibility is to foster and enhance these conditions, to contribute towards building a society that thrives on respect for each other's rights and freedoms. The process of delivering peace, much like any significant social change, requires time, patience, and determination. It requires us to engage in dialogue, negotiate differing views, and find grounds for compromise. It demands us to confront our biases, tackle our issues head-on, and work assiduously towards resolving them. Yet, the challenges or complexities implicated in this task should not dissuade us from walking this path. Instead, they should inspire us to act with greater courage and conviction. Speech, encompassing everyone's voices and diverse perspectives, serves as an extremely powerful avenue for achieving peace. It enables us to express our thoughts, needs, and aspirations, thereby creating an environment conducive to understanding and empathy. It encourages us to come together, learn from each other, and work cooperatively towards a common goal.

Should mba really required work experience can't I prepare for cat and after btech directly apply to well known iims/xlri?","output":"These two questions address similar concerns but do not have the exact same meaning. Let us break them down individually and compare their implications. Question 1: \\"Should I drop one year after BTech for MBA preparations?\\" This question is asking whether it's a good idea to take a gap year after completing a Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degree in order to prepare for pursuing a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree. The focus of this question is on time management and the best approach for an individual to prepare for MBA entrance exams like the CAT (Common Admission Test). By suggesting \\"dropping one year,\\" the question implies that the asker is considering dedicating a whole year to prepare for MBA entrance exams, without pursuing any full-time work or other educational commitments during that time. Question 2: \\"Should MBA really require work experience; can't I prepare for CAT and after BTech directly apply to well-known IIMs/XLRI?\\" This question is addressing the requirement of work experience before admission into a prestigious MBA program. The asker is questioning whether it's possible to directly apply for a top MBA program like those in IIMs (Indian Institutes of Management) or XLRI (Xavier School of Management) right after completing their BTech degree. The question also subtly notes the possibility of preparing for the CAT exam while still enrolled in the BTech program, rather than taking a gap year for such preparations (as suggested in the first question). In summary, the focus of the first question is primarily on the idea of taking a gap year after completing a BTech degree specifically for MBA entrance exam preparation. Whereas the second question questions the necessity of work experience as part of MBA application requirements, and whether a student can directly apply and prepare for the entrance exams during their undergraduate studies. When comparing these two questions, we can see that they both address concerns related to the timeline and prerequisites for MBA applications. However, they differ in that the first question centers around the strategy of taking a year off for exam preparations, and the second question probes the need for work experience and the feasibility of preparing for exams during undergraduate studies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Supporters of organic foods -- a term whose meaning varies greatly --are frequently telling the world that such products are safer and more nutritious than others. The growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of daily foods is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been aroused by sweeping claims that the conventional food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs. Almost daily, the public is surrounded by claims for \\"no-aging\\" diets, new vitamins and other wonder foods.

However, if the premise were to say, \\"I am employed by the public service, but I do not have any time left to volunteer for any additional activities,\\" we could conclude that the hypothesis is false. Yet, neither of these examples come from the given premise, so it remains unclear whether the person volunteers for public service or not. In conclusion, we cannot confirm nor deny the hypothesis \\"I volunteer for public service,\\" based solely on the unclear and insufficient information provided in the initial premise. More context and details would be required to make a substantial determination on the truthfulness of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Information:  - The Crab Nebula (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus. The now-current name is due to William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. Corresponding to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054, the nebula was observed later by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.  - The Crab Pulsar ( PSR B0531 +21 ) is a relatively young neutron star . The star is the central star in the Crab Nebula , a remnant of the supernova SN 1054 , which was widely observed on Earth in the year 1054 . Discovered in 1968 , the pulsar was the first to be connected with a supernova remnant . The Crab Pulsar is one of very few pulsars to be identified optically . The optical pulsar is roughly 20 km in diameter and the pulsar \`\` beams '' rotate once every 33 milliseconds , or 30 times each second . The outflowing relativistic wind from the neutron star generates synchrotron emission , which produces the bulk of the emission from the nebula , seen from radio waves through to gamma rays . The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar 's equatorial wind slams into the surrounding nebula , forming a termination shock . The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly , with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp - like features that steepen , brighten , then fade as they move away from the pulsar into the main body of the nebula . The period of the pulsar 's rotation is slowing by 38 nanoseconds per day due to the large amounts of energy carried away in the pulsar wind . The Crab Nebula is often used as a calibration source in X-ray astronomy . It is very bright in X-rays and the flux density and spectrum are known to be constant , with the exception of the pulsar itself . The pulsar provides a strong periodic signal that is used to check the timing of the X-ray detectors . In X-ray astronomy , ' crab ' and ' millicrab ' are sometimes used as units of flux density . A millicrab corresponds to a flux density of about 2.4x10  11 erg s  1 cm  2 ( 2.4x10  14 W m  2 ) in the 2 -- 10 keV X-ray band , for a \`\` crab - like '' X-ray spectrum , which is roughly a powerlaw in photon energy , I ( E ) = 9.5 E  1.1 . Very few X-ray sources ever exceed one crab in brightness .  - A nebula (Latin for \\"cloud\\"; pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.

Let's play a fun game to find the value of \\"n: First, look at this equation: 1610 = -447 * n + 3258 - 7012 Now, let's follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the numbers (3258 - 7012). Imagine you have 3258 candies, and you give away 7012 candies. You end up with -3254 candies. So the equation becomes: 1610 = -447 * n - 3254 Step 2: Now let's get the numbers on one side and the \\"n\\" on the other side. To do that, we will add 3254 to both sides of the equation. This is like giving 3254 candies to both sides, so they are still equal. 1610 + 3254 = -447 * n 3864 = -447 * n Step 3: Finally, we want to find out how many times -447 fits into 3864. It's like figuring out how many groups of -447 candies you can make using 3864 candies. To find this, we'll divide 3864 by -447. n = 3864 / -447 n ≈ -8.63 (approximately) So, n is approximately equal to -8.63. That's our final answer! Good job!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Article: My son Jack, a fourth grader, was having a hard time in getting interested in story books recently, so I offered to read the first few chapters to him. In the early pages of 'Incident at Halk Hill', a quiet little boy has a special meeting with a female badger  .Soon after, another badger is caught in a steel leg trap , and the author describes in detail the pain and scare of an animal struggling to its death. We meet the cruel hunter and his ill treatment of a dog; we see the badger being skinned by the boy's father;and we experience the child's confusion when beaten by his father in anger. _ , I thought. Last night , I returned from a weekend away to find that Jack had finished the whole book on his own. \\"It was really, really good and sad, and violent,\\" he reported. \\"There was a lot of killing.\\" \\"Were there any happy parts?\\" I asked, \\"The boy's life was saved by the badger, and that was good. But then that badger got caught in a trap again and at the end it's dying, too. \\" Jack said, \\"It was so sad that I almost cried. \\" I told him that many books have made me cry, beginning with Heidi, when I was just his age, right on up to the novel I finished last week. \\"Well,\\" he admitted then, \\"I actually did cry. Reading that book just reminded me of all the sadness in the world, and it made me feel sad ,too. \\" So, I think, now he has been through the sad tone of the passage , the discovery that words on a printed page can give rise to such strong emotion ,that a book can move you right out of your own comfortable little self and into someone else's pain. Thus we come to realize that if we are to remain fully engaged in life, open to its mysteries and feel sorry towards its suffering, we indeed need stories to grab  us by the neck and remind us of the sadness in the world that is not our own.

Context: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.”  Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: What is probably true about the author? Options:  A.

The 1985 Japanese comedy Tampopo was publicized as not sphagetti, but what type of western?","output":"The 1985 Japanese comedy film Tampopo was not publicized as a spaghetti western, but rather as a \\"ramen western.\\" The term \\"ramen western\\" is a play on the famous term \\"spaghetti western,\\" which referred to western films produced by Italian filmmakers during the 1960s and 1970s. While spaghetti westerns were known for their unique style, gritty settings, and often revisionist take on the classic American western, the ramen western takes on a completely new twist by focusing on Japanese culture and cuisine, particularly ramen.  Directed by Juzo Itami, Tampopo is a satirical and humorous nod to classic western film tropes and combines them with a uniquely Japanese cultural emblem – ramen. The plot revolves around the titular character Tampopo (played by Nobuko Miyamoto), a widowed owner of a struggling ramen shop. She meets Goro (Tsutomu Yamazaki), a truck driver and ramen enthusiast who decides to help her improve her culinary skills and elevate her ramen shop to new heights. The film follows their journey as they strive to create the perfect bowl of ramen and explores various themes such as food, love, friendship, and the quest for excellence. As a ramen western, Tampopo incorporates several elements from the traditional western genre, such as lone heroes, showdowns, and an emphasis on justice and honor. However, it cleverly replaces cowboys and gunslingers with ramen masters and culinary experts, and the wild west landscape with the bustling world of Japanese ramen shops. The film showcases the art of ramen making and draws viewers into the meticulous process behind creating a delicious and memorable dish. Additionally, Tampopo is noted for its non-linear narrative structure, as the main storyline is interspersed with various comedic, sensual, and dramatic vignettes that revolve around food and its significance in people's lives. These scenes range from a gangster and his mistress experimenting with food erotically, to a dying mother cooking one last meal for her family, to a business etiquette lesson where the trainees defy their teacher's sushi-eating instructions. Tampopo was a critical and commercial success, both domestically in Japan and internationally. The film received high praise for its unique blend of humor, intricate culinary details, and unconventional storytelling. Not only did it reinvent the western genre through the lens of Japanese culture, but it also established itself as a beloved classic in the world of food-centric films. Today, Tampopo continues to be celebrated for its exceptional creativity and its lasting impact on audiences, further solidifying its position as the quintessential ramen western."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In some countries, because the man realizes that the traveler is tired and eager to reach his destination  , he will politely say \\"Just down the road.\\" He thinks this is more encouraging, gentler, and therefore the wanted answer. So the American drives through the night, getting more and more angry, feeling \\"being tricked\\". He thinks the man on purpose lied to him, for obviously he must have known the distance quite well. Had conditions been reversed  , the American would have felt he was \\"cheating\\" the driver if he had said the next town was not too far, and if he would be sorry to the weary driver, he would say \\"You have a good way to go yet, it is at least fifteen miles.\\" The driver might be disappointed, but he would know what to expect. Whether to be accurate or polite leads to many misunderstandings between people of different cultures. If you know the situation in advance, it is sometimes easier to recognize the problem. We can learn from this passage that Americans   _  . A) are polite to anybody B) like to be honest and accurate C) often lie to others D) have no sympathy to others","output":"From this passage, we can learn that Americans prefer to be honest and accurate (Option B) in their interactions with others, especially when providing information or directions. This cultural preference for accuracy and honesty stems from their belief that it is better to set realistic expectations and provide useful information. However, individuals from other cultures might prioritize politeness and providing an encouraging response, which can lead to misunderstandings between people with these differing cultural values. The passage presents a scenario where an American asks a local individual for directions to the nearest village. The local person, prioritizing a polite response, tells the American that the village is \\"just down the road\\" despite the fact that the distance is actually much further. In the passage, this response is perceived as dishonest, and the American becomes increasingly frustrated as they continue to drive without reaching their destination. If the roles were reversed, the passage suggests that the American would feel like they were \\"cheating\\" the driver if they were to provide a vague or dishonest answer. Instead, they would opt to be honest about the distance, admitting that the destination is \\"at least fifteen miles\\" away. Although this response might leave the driver feeling disappointed, they would at least have a clear understanding of what to expect in terms of distance, avoiding the frustration that comes from feeling misled. The main theme here is the differences in cultural preferences when it comes to communication. Americans value honesty and accuracy, while people from other cultures may prioritize politeness and encouragement. Understanding these cultural variations can help alleviate misunderstandings and foster more effective communication between people from different backgrounds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An investigation into an Oklahoma dentist accused of potentially exposing patients to disease confirmed one case of patient-to-patient hepatitis C transmission, health officials said Wednesday. A total of 89 of W. Scott Harrington's patients tested positive for hepatitis C, but at this point only the one case has been directly tied to his dental practice in suburban Tulsa, officials said. Four cases of HIV were also found in his patients; the CDC is conducting genetic testing to determine whether those cases are tied to the dental office. \\"This is the first documented report of patient-to-patient transmission of hepatitis C virus associated with a dental setting in the United States,\\" state epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley said. \\"While dental procedures are generally safe, this reinforces the importance of adhering to strict infection control procedures in dental settings.\\" Scores of Tulsa dental patients tested for hepatitis,","output":"HIV, and other blood-borne diseases were left in shock after discovering the extent of the potential exposure, emphasizing the critical nature of maintaining a high standard of safety protocols and hygienic practices within dental facilities. The impact of this outbreak on the patient population has been significant, leading to increased vigilance and demand for accountability in dental practices across the region. State health officials and professional associations have consequently been prioritizing the implementation of mandatory infection control guidelines, routine inspections, and continuous education efforts as key measures to prevent such incidents in the future. Ongoing investigations by health authorities and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlight the importance of maintaining accurate record-keeping and thorough sterilization processes for dental instruments, as well as consistent monitoring of dental health care personnel for adherence to proper infection control procedures. In response to the Harrington case, dental associations are advocating for stricter regulations on the use of disposable items, more rigorous sterilization protocols for reusable instruments, and increased transparency when communicating potential risks to patients. Furthermore, health experts are recommending additional training for dental professionals in the identification and management of potential disease transmission events. Such training would encompass various aspects, including patient history assessments, measures to prevent cross-contamination, and proper waste disposal practices. By equipping dental staff with the knowledge and tools to mitigate the risks of disease transmission, patients can be reassured of the safety and quality of the dental care they receive. Public awareness campaigns are also being launched to educate the general population about the importance of safe dental practices and to encourage patients to actively assess and inquire about the cleanliness and sterilization methods being used in their dental care facilities. Patients hold a crucial role in ensuring their well-being by remaining vigilant and advocating for higher safety standards in the dental industry. The unfortunate transmission of hepatitis C in this Oklahoma dental practice underscores the essential need for consistent compliance with established infection control guidelines across the dental industry. This incident serves as an alarming reminder that even routine procedures can have potentially severe consequences when dental professionals exhibit negligent behavior. In the wake of this incident, stringent measures must be adopted, and patients are urged to take an active role in demanding adherence to infection control standards to mitigate the risks and ensure the continued safety of dental practices nationwide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
