Question: What is the Asian gang's name? Title: Fatal Beauty Movie plot: Detective Rita Rizzoli (Whoopi Goldberg) is an undercover narcotics police officer who stages an undercover buy with drug dealer Tito Delgadillo, when during the bust she sees her friend and informant Charlene being dragged out of the bar by her pimp and runs to her aid, alerting Delgadillo of being an undercover cop. After saving Charlene and shooting the pimp, Rizzoli notices all the money used for the buy is missing. Delgadillo retreats to a warehouse in Los Angeles where a family of Asian immigrants is preparing plastic envelopes of imported cocaine stamped with the gang's brand name \\"Fatal Beauty\\".

Delgadillo discovers the error but before they can correct it, the house is attacked by two small-time hoods, Leo Nova and Earl Skinner (Brad Dourif and Mike Jolly) who kill everyone within including Delgadillo and steal the lethal product.Back at the police station, Rizzoli is chewed out by her boss, Lt. Kellerman (John P. Ryan), for ruining the bust when he receives a call in which Rizzoli is needed at the warehouse where the drugs were being made. At the warehouse Rizzoli identifies Delgadillo as the only victim whom authorities weren't able to identify because his face was mutilated during the attack by pointing out the diamond pinkie ring on his finger bearing his initials that he showed Rizzoli earlier that evening. Rizzoli also discovers traces of Fatal Beauty and Charlie Dawson's body, which was stuffed in a van labeled \\"Kroll Enterprises\\". The next morning Rizzoli receives a call from Charlene, asking for money. When Rizzoli refuses, Charlene offers some information about the drug-related murder the previous night, hoping to sway Rizzoli to give her the money.

Answer based on context: After battling the Super Bowl champions in Week 9, the winless Raiders went back home for Week 10 to take on their divisional rival and the defending AFC Champion Denver Broncos for the first time all year. Broncos QB Peyton Manning was immediately picked off by cornerback D.J. Hayden on his second pass of the game 30 seconds in. Taking over near midfield, the Raiders got down to the Denver 23, but were forced to kick a 41-yard field goal, which Janikowski was successful on. Broncos kicker Brandon McManus responded with a field goal of his own, and the game was tied at 3 apiece. In the second quarter, McManus added another field goal and, later in the period, the Raiders intercepted Manning again; this time, it was Justin Tuck. Oakland scored a touchdown off the turnover and took a 10-6 lead on a Derek Carr 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brice Butler. However, after 2 unsuccessful drives for each team, Carr was  intercepted by Denver cornerback Bradley Roby and the Broncos stormed back with two quick touchdowns. Both touchdowns were passes by Manning to C.J. Anderson and Emmanuel Sanders of 51 and 32 yards, respectively. Denver led 20-10 at the half. In the second half, Oakland's offensive miscues continued as Khalif Barnes fumbled at his own 13-yard line, and the Broncos wasted no time as Manning's 10-yard pass to Julius Thomas put Denver up by 17. Oakland's next possession ended in a punt, and Manning went right back to Thomas for another touchdown, Peyton's fourth of the day and second from 32 yards out. Carr was picked off again, the Broncos scored yet another touchdown on Manning's fifth of the game and second to Emmanuel Sanders, and the visitors took a commanding 41-10 lead. Down 31 points, the Raiders headed into the 4th quarter getting embarrassed by the potent Denver offense, and were unable to do much more than score an insignificant touchdown with 53 seconds left. The Broncos left Oakland with a 41-17 win and moved to 7-2 on the season. Meanwhile, the Raiders' woes continued as their record fell to 0-9.

Write a text based on \\"casino operators complain about higher taxes with open boarding\\" Text:","output":"Title: Casino Operators Face Increased Tax Challenges with Open Boarding Policies Introduction Open boarding has created incredible opportunities for trade, tourism, and economic growth in several countries. Though seemingly beneficial, this policy has met diverse reactions, particularly from casino operators who complain about higher taxes imposed on their establishments. The impact of increased taxes, combined with open boarding policies, is a double-edged sword for casino operators. While there are potential windfalls from an influx of tourism, the rising taxes directly impact their bottom line and jeopardize the industry's growth potential. Tax Burden and Challenges Casino operators have become increasingly vocal about the mounting tax burden levied on their businesses as a result of open boarding policies. Governments have instituted these tax hikes, assuming that the presence of a more significant number of tourists under open boarding would translate to increased revenue for casinos. However, this belief overlooks several critical factors and challenges faced by these operators amid the booming tourism sector. Higher Operating Costs Casino operators have cited higher operating costs as one of the primary reasons behind their grievances. The influx of tourists under open boarding policies has resulted in increased expenses across the tourism sector, including accommodations, logistics, and transportation. As casinos expand their operations to accommodate and attract a more significant number of patrons, the operational costs associated with new hiring, training, and infrastructure development have skyrocketed. Consequently, the higher taxes imposed on these businesses place additional strain on their financial resources, leaving thin profit margins for casino operators. Competition and Market Saturation The open boarding policy has stimulated competition in the casino industry. As governments get enticed by the prospect of increased revenues generated by casino taxes, they often issue more licenses, thereby making the market more competitive. With the proliferation of casinos, businesses are pushed to expand their facilities, provide more gaming options, and experiment with pricing strategies to stay afloat. This stiff competition also implies that increased taxes imposed on casino operators are split across a larger pool of businesses, further diminishing their financial gains. Increased Regulation and Compliance Alongside higher taxes, casino operators also complain about increased regulation and compliance requirements stemming from open boarding policies. With more tourists flocking to their establishments, businesses have had to deal with additional regulation and scrutiny geared towards responsible gambling and the prevention of money laundering efforts. While these measures are essential for maintaining the integrity of the gaming industry, they present further operational costs for casino operators, who must now invest in legal counsel and auditing services. This increased regulation adds to their tax burden, complicating the already challenging equation. The Balance Between Taxation and Growth For the casino industry to continue thriving in an era of open boarding, it is crucial to strike a balance between taxation rates and business growth. Governments must reassess the potential impact of over-taxation on casino businesses to prevent long-lasting implications on the growth, sustenance, and profitability of these establishments. Excessively high taxes may stifle the casino industry, leading to job losses, reduced tourism appeal, and an economic downturn. Governments must design tax policies that carefully consider the casino operators' challenges and account for their financial risks. It is necessary to establish a tax environment that promotes growth, encourages innovation, and maintains the competitiveness of the casino industry. Often, an open boarding policy could work against its very objective of embracing globalization, let alone fostering close ties with neighboring countries. Therefore, it is in the best interest of all stakeholders to address the casino operators' concerns and create a sustainable future where everyone prospers. Conclusion Casino operators face multiple challenges brought about by open boarding policies, with increased taxation being a pressing concern. As countries continue to embrace globalization, it is crucial to adapt tax frameworks and regulations to address the realities faced by businesses in the casino industry. Striking a balance between taxation and growth, along with understanding the unique challenges of the industry, will foster a more inclusive, prosperous, and robust casino market for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), is the brand used by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark when it provides humanitarian aid and development assistance to other countries, with focus on developing countries. There is no distinct Danida organisation within the Ministry. Can we draw the following conclusion? DANIDA provides developing country with food and clothing.","output":"Based on the information provided about the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), it is an initiative used by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark to provide humanitarian aid and development assistance to countries, particularly those that are developing. While it does not explicitly mention that DANIDA provides food and clothing, it can be inferred that these could be part of the support offered by the agency, but it is important to understand that their assistance would encompass a broader range of development initiatives. To draw a more nuanced and accurate conclusion, we must first dive into the different sectors and the broader role DANIDA plays in the international development sphere. The primary objective of DANIDA is to contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable development in developing countries. It works in partnership with these countries to promote initiatives that can help them achieve their development goals. Some of the focus areas of DANIDA's development assistance include: 1. Sustainable economic development: DANIDA supports activities that promote economic growth, decent employment opportunities, and economic self-sufficiency, such as investment in infrastructure, trade development, and private sector growth. 2. Governance and human rights: DANIDA works on strengthening democratic processes, promoting human rights, and improving the delivery of public services in recipient countries. 3. Humanitarian assistance: In times of disasters or conflict, DANIDA provides emergency relief supplies and support to affected populations, which may include food and clothing as part of the essential items necessary for immediate survival. 4. Social development: DANIDA engages in initiatives that improve the quality of life for individuals in developing countries by increasing access to education, healthcare, and social protection services. 5. Environment and climate change: DANIDA supports projects that protect the environment, tackle climate change, and promote sustainable use of natural resources. 6. Gender equality: DANIDA aims to promote gender equality, empowering women and girls, and ensuring their equal contributions to and benefits from development efforts are prioritized. From this in-depth look at DANIDA's various focus areas, it becomes evident that while the provision of food and clothing may be a part of the agency's humanitarian assistance, DANIDA's broader mission goes beyond that and encompasses an extensive range of developmental initiatives. Therefore, it would be more accurate to conclude that DANIDA's role is to provide comprehensive humanitarian aid and development assistance, which may include, but is not limited to, providing food and clothing to developing countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. resistance available: 1.8, 2.4 and 2.8 ohms Make this proper case.","output":"Resistance Available: 1.8, 2.4, and 2.8 Ohms When working with electrical circuits and components, it is crucial to understand the resistance values of the different elements involved. In this given scenario, we have three distinct resistance values: 1.8 Ohms, 2.4 Ohms, and 2.8 Ohms. Before we delve deeper into the significance of these values, let's first provide a brief overview of resistance and its importance in electrical circuits. Resistance is a fundamental property of any conductor or electronic component that opposes the flow of electric current through it. It is measured in the unit of Ohms (symbolized by the Greek letter Omega, Ω). In essence, resistance is the force that tries to slow down electric current, converting some of it into heat energy in the process. The main factors that influence a material's resistance properties are its length, cross-sectional area, temperature, and inherent resistivity. The three available resistance values in this case - 1.8, 2.4, and 2.8 Ohms - indicate that we are working with components that possess low to moderate levels of resistance. In a practical application setting, selecting the appropriate resistance value for use in a specific circuit would depend on various factors, such as the desired current flow, voltage drop, or power dissipation limits. One common application involving resistors with these values entails employing them in circuits designed for voltage division, current limiting, or setting the operating points of other semiconductor devices, such as transistors or operational amplifiers. Combining these resistors in series or parallel configurations allows users to attain even more resistance values, thereby enabling the fine-tuning of circuit parameters. For example, in a series connection, the total resistance would be the sum of the individual resistances: 1.8 + 2.4 + 2.8 = 7 Ohms. Conversely, in a parallel connection, the overall resistance is derived from the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of individual resistances: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 1/R_total = 1/1.8 + 1/2.4 + 1/2.8 R_total ≈ 0.96 Ohms If required, adjusting the selection of resistors in your circuit design can facilitate a vast array of applications, directly impacting the circuit's performance. Ultimately, utilizing the provided resistance values—1.8, 2.4, and 2.8 Ohms—can prove advantageous in creating optimized, energy-efficient circuits with various functionalities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The suspected ringleader of the deadly terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, will remain jailed until trial, a federal magistrate ruled on Wednesday. Ahmed Abu Khatallah appeared at a brief detention hearing in federal court in Washington where he's accused of providing material support to terrorists. Court documents released on the eve of the hearing allege he \\"conspired to participate and then participated\\" in the September 11, 2012, attack on the American outpost in eastern Libya that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. He previously pleaded not guilty to the charge that carries a maximum life prison sentence. More are charges are possible. Abu Khatallah, who is thought to be in his early 40s, was captured earlier this month in Libya and transferred to the United States last weekend. Authorities contend that he's a senior leader of Ansar al Sharia, whose members were among several militias that participated in the two-pronged armed assault. Assailants armed with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades first blasted through the main diplomatic mission before setting it ablaze, the court papers said. Stevens and State Department information officer Sean Smith died there. A coordinated mortar assault on a nearby annex killed security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. \\"The defendant's participation in the attack was motivated by his extremist ideology,\\" prosecutors said in the documents, which also alleged that Abu Khatallah \\"voiced concern and opposition to the presence of an American facility in Benghazi\\" days prior to the attack.

But last summer, when blackouts struck much of the northeastern US, Ontario and Rome, consumers on two continents were given a painful reminder of just how easily broken electricity supplies can be. The massive disorder stranded  commuters, stopped freezers, shut down businesses and refocused attention on where most of the planet's power comes from:oil-and-gas-fired generators and nuclear plants, These sources not only pollute the environment but also make many consumers feel unacceptable health risks. Companies are trying to offer an alternative, clean energy from renewable resources that's plentiful and portable. Lifton's Medis Technologies, as well as companies like Hydrogenics and Nanosys, is tapping into fuel cells and dolor panels to give people power whenever and wherever they want it, free from dependence on local grids . The search for alternative energy is nothing new, but the current trend of innovators is focusing on the goal of making clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity. For example, the fuel cell, which produces electricity from the chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen, has been around for about 150 years, though its commercial development did not begin until the 1960s and then only as part of NASA spacecraft. Today this technology is coming down to Earth in places like Tokyo; in nine European cities, from Stockholm to Porto, each operating three hydrogen-fuel-cell buses; and in Iceland, which is trying to create the first fuel free hydrogen economy by 2030. When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces heat and water. Fuel cells use this reaction to generate electricity. With the cell phone and gadget market in mind, Medis has developed a fuel cell with cheap components that produces little heat and effortlessly reduces waste water without turning to energy consuming pumps.

Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.

Please write a short summary for the following article: A Therapist Is Better at Handling Emotions Than You Are Impressive findings from the other side of the therapy couch: your therapist is better at regulating her emotions than you are, according to a small new study in the journal Psychotherapy. The authors wanted to see if psychotherapists are better at regulating emotion than the rest of us, so they tested experienced therapists as well as non-therapists by showing them pictures designed to elicit negative emotional reactions, ranging from slightly negative images like sad people to very intense images like corpses and people with severe injuries. After each image, they rated how negative the image made them feel. Both groups reacted the same way to the negative images. But differences emerged during the second part of the study, when people were shown the pictures again and told to use one of two techniques that regulates emotion: either positive reappraisal, in which you reinterpret emotional information in a positive light, or distraction—thinking about something unrelated and neutral in order to disengage from the negativity. Both have been shown to be effective against negative emotions. Therapists, the researchers found, were better at calming their emotional response by using these emotion regulation strategies than the non-therapists, regardless of which technique they chose. “It’s something they need for that job and something that makes them be effective in what they do,” says study author Jan Pletzer, a graduate student in business administration at Jacobs University Bremen in Germany and in social and organizational psychology at the VU University Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Next, Pletzer hopes to find out whether therapists come into their profession equipped with these emotional skills, or whether they hone them on the job. “I suspect maybe it’s a little bit of both,” says psychologist Mary Karapetian Alvord, PhD, adjunct associate professor at Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, who was not involved in the study. But just because non-therapists have less training doesn’t mean they’re doomed to be less emotionally intelligent than the professionals sitting across from them. We regulate our emotions through our thoughts, Alvord says—a key skill every good therapist learns how to do. “What lay people can do is really learn to catch your thoughts, be aware of your thoughts and recognize that those thoughts then lead to an emotional reaction and a physiological reaction,” she says. “Recognizing those connections is absolutely critical, and most people don’t. We think about emotions, but we don’t think about the thoughts and reframing and getting a different perspective.” When we do, she says, the effects can be huge on both our mind and body. Reframe a speedbump into a positive, and “immediately you recognize that your body relaxes, your muscles aren’t as tense, you feel better and you have a better outlook for the rest of the day,” Alvord says. “It’s something that therapists learn, to catch themselves.”","output":"Imagine you and a therapist are looking at some pictures. Some of these pictures are a little bit sad, and some are very sad, with hurt people or even dead bodies. After looking at the pictures, both you and the therapist feel sad. But here's the interesting part: therapists are better at making themselves feel better after looking at sad pictures. They do this by using two techniques: one is thinking about the sad picture in a positive way, and the other is thinking about something else that's not sad at all. This helps them not to feel sad anymore. It's important for therapists to be good at making themselves feel better, because that helps them do their job of helping other people feel better too. So, even though therapists may be better at making themselves feel better than we are, we can still learn how to do it too. One way is to be more aware of our thoughts and how they make us feel. If we can do that, we can learn to change the way we think about things, and that can help us feel better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Burges died, aged 53, in his Red Bed at the Tower House, at 11.45 p.m. on Wednesday 20 April 1881. While on a tour of works at Cardiff, he caught a chill and returned to London, half-paralysed, where he lay dying for some three weeks. Among his last visitors were Oscar Wilde and James Whistler. He was buried in the tomb he designed for his mother at West Norwood, London. On his death, John Starling Chapple, Burges's office manager and close associate for more than twenty years, wrote \\"a constant relationship ... with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe. Thank God his work will live and ... be the admiration of future students. I have hardly got to realize my lonely position yet. He was almost all the world to me.\\" Lady Bute, wife of his greatest patron, wrote, \\"Dear Burges, ugly Burges, who designed such lovely things – what a duck.\\" In Saint Fin Barre's, together with memorials to his mother and sister, there is a memorial plaque to Burges, designed by him, and erected by his father. It shows the King of Heaven presiding over the four apostles, who hold open the Word of God. Under the inscription \\"Architect of this cathedral\\" is a simple shield and a small, worn, plaque with a mosaic surround, bearing Burges's entwined initials and name. Legal complications obstructed Burges's wish to be buried in the cathedral he had built. Burges's own words on Saint Fin Barre's, in his letter of January 1877 to the Bishop of Cork, sum up his career, \\"Fifty years hence, the whole affair will be on its trial and, the elements of time and cost being forgotten, the result only will be looked at. The great questions will then be, first, is this work beautiful and, secondly, have those to whom it was entrusted, done it with all their heart and all their ability.\\" A:","output":"The last name of the person who caught a chill and returned to London is Burges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In his company he was known as Office Desk, because when he was working he always sat behind his well-used piece of conference table standing in a hard to notice corner in the software specialists' room. Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs for the 0-1 Computer Associates company. While the Man Called Office Desk (MCOD, or simply Cod in an alternative version) was writing an intuitive program for the management of empty office desk space in software companies, a thing that nobody had ever expected to happen happened. Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk. It would have been much more entertaining to watch, you could have laughed at him a little, and the nickname, given to him by the programmers' boss would have gotten a whole new meaning. And right now, there wasn't even much to talk about during cigarette breaks. Warm did not hide the fact he would have preferred to fuse with a mouse, or a mouse pad. Right now, all he could do was to pretend he totally ignored the fact he was physically stuck to a chair.

Aaliyah Dana Haughton was born on January 16, 1979, in Brooklyn, New York, and was the younger child of Diane and Michael \\"Miguel\\" Haughton (1951–2012). She was of African-American descent, and had Native American (Oneida) heritage from a grandmother.

When Aaliyah was five years old, her family moved to Detroit, Michigan, where she was reared along with her older brother, Rashad. She attended a Catholic school, Gesu Elementary, where in first grade she was cast in the stage play Annie, which inspired her to become an entertainer. In Detroit, her father began working in the warehouse business, one of his brother-in-law Barry Hankerson's widening interests. Her mother stayed home and raised Aaliyah and her brother.Throughout Aaliyah’s life, she had a good relationship with Rashad, who recalled Aaliyah having a beautiful voice as a child. Aaliyah's family was very close due to the struggles of her grandparents and when they moved to Detroit, the Hankersons were ready to take them in if necessary. These same bonds led to ties in the music industry, under the Blackground Records label.Aaliyah's mother was a vocalist, and her uncle, Barry Hankerson, was an entertainment lawyer who had been married to Gladys Knight.

Then, as he fills the well, they are frantic, and he replaces the wood bridge; thus he cements their allegiance, and, in effect communicates with them. Meanwhile, Charlotte appears to take care of Henrietta, who falls sick and is an annoyingly meddlesome woman.The mother rat, whose life Willard saved, brings one of her off-spring to him. Willard learns that through Socrates, as he has named his pet, he can order the others in the pack to do his bidding, except for the mischievous Ben, who occasionally disobeys. Willard tests the rats' obedience by disrupting a dinner party Martin is hosting and to which he has not been invited.When Willard's mother dies, leaving him with the heavily mortgaged house, he uses the rats to help him steal money from one of his company's customers. Willard has begun the habit of taking Socrates and Ben to the office and letting them hide in the storeroom where one day they are...

Help as much as you can. Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is there 500 acres of on Upper Table Rock?, using the article: Starting approximately 40 million years ago in the middle Eocene, a braided river system called the \\"Ancestral Rogue River\\" flowed through the region where the Rogue Valley is now carved. For about 2.1 million years, the river deposited what is now known as the Payne Cliffs Formation by laying down a thin conglomerate, followed by arkosic sandstone and siltstone. Between 10 and 20 million years ago, the uplift that created the nearby Klamath Mountains caused an incision that formed the Rogue River valley. Vertical erosion, or downcutting of the Rogue River continues to keep pace with the recent uplift, with about 690 feet (210 m) of erosion occurring in the past seven million years.Approximately seven million years ago in the upper Miocene, a 44-mile (71 km) long trachyandesitic lava flow that likely came from Olson Mountain near present-day Lost Creek Lake flowed down the Ancestral Rogue River and its tributaries and spread throughout the valley. This lava formed a hard cap over the Payne Cliffs Formation. At Lost Creek Lake, the lava attained its maximum thickness of 730 feet (220 m) and thinned to about 100 to 200 feet (30 to 61 m) to the north of Medford.   Since the Olson eruption, the Rogue River has eroded 90 percent of the solidified lava. Though the andesite prevented much erosion to the caps of the Table Rocks, the andesite-capped cliffs eroded from the side as the softer sedimentary units of the Payne Cliffs Formation gave way. This erosion created expansive talus fields which surround the plateaus on all sides, creating slopes capable of supporting abundant plant and animal life. Upper and Lower Table Rock both stand 800 feet (240 m) above the valley floor, and just over 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level. There are approximately 300 acres (120 ha) of level ground on Lower Table Rock, and 500 acres (200 ha) on Upper Table Rock.The Table Rocks offer an example of inverted relief, in which previous topographic lows are filled with a resistant rock and become new topographic highs after the erosion..., what would be the answer ?

During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac. The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers.  Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws.  Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of some rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly.

Given the question: Information:  - A graduate school (sometimes shortened as grad school) is a school that awards advanced academic degrees (i.e. master's and doctoral degrees) with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate (bachelor's) degree with a high grade point average. A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine, nursing, business, engineering, or law. The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute, as various professional schools offer graduate degrees (e.g., some nursing schools offer a master's degree in nursing). Also, some graduate degrees train students for a specific profession (e.g. an MSc or a PhD in epidemiology trains a person to be an epidemiologist).  - The Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) is the teaching hospital and biomedical research facility of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, located in Baltimore City, Maryland, U.S. It was founded in 1889 using money from a bequest by philanthropist Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins Hospital and the school of medicine are the founding institutions of modern American medicine and the birthplace of numerous medical traditions including rounds, residents and housestaff. Many medical specialties were formed at the hospital including neurosurgery, by Harvey Cushing; cardiac surgery by Alfred Blalock; and pediatrics and child psychiatry, by Leo Kanner.  - Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.  - The Johns Hopkins University (commonly referred to as Johns Hopkins, JHU, or simply Hopkins) is an American private research university in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1876, the university was named for its first benefactor, the American entrepreneur, abolitionist, and philanthropist Johns Hopkins. His 7 million bequestof which half financed the establishment of The Johns Hopkins Hospitalwas the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States at that time. Daniel Coit Gilman, who was inaugurated as the institution's first president on February 22, 1876, led the university to revolutionize higher education in the U.S. by integrating teaching and research. Adopting the concept of a graduate school from Germany's ancient Heidelberg University, Johns Hopkins University is considered the first research university in the United States.  - John Lewis Holland (October 21, 1919  November 27, 2008) was an American psychologist and Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University. He was the creator of the career development model, \\"Holland Occupational Themes,\\" otherwise known as The Holland Codes.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Daniel Coit Gilman (July 6, 1831  October 13, 1908) was an American educator and academic. Gilman was instrumental in founding the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale College, and subsequently served as the third president of the University of California, as the first president of Johns Hopkins University, and as founding president of the Carnegie Institution. He was also co-founder of the Russell Trust Association, which administers the business affairs of Yale's Skull and Bones society. Gilman served for twenty five years as president of Johns Hopkins; his inauguration in 1876 has been said to mark \\"the starting point of postgraduate education in the U.S.\\"  - Heidelberg University (informally Heidelberg) is a public research university located in the town of Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Founded in 1386 on instruction of Pope Urban VI, Heidelberg is Germany's oldest university and one of the world's oldest surviving universities. It was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire.  - Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank.  - A psychologist is a professional who evaluates and studies behavior and mental processes (see also psychology). Typically, psychologists must have completed a university degree in psychology, which is a master's degree in some countries and a doctorate in others. This definition of psychologist is non-exclusive; in most jurisdictions, members of other professions (such as counselors and psychiatrists) can also evaluate, diagnose, treat, and study mental processes. Some psychologists, such as clinical and counseling psychologists, provide mental health care, and some psychologists, such as social or organizational psychologists conduct research and provide consultation services.  - The Holland Codes or the Holland Occupational Themes ( RIASEC ) refers to a theory of careers and vocational choice ( based upon personality types ) that was initially developed by American psychologist John L. Holland ( 1919 - 2008 ) , Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University . The US Department of Labor ETA has been using an updated and expanded version of the RIASEC model in the \`\` Interests '' section of its free online database , The Occupational Information Network ( O * NET ) , since its inception during the late 1990s .  - Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.

When Louise goes below deck, a large, strange cloud on the horizon passes over the craft, leaving a reflective mist on Scott's bare skin. The couple are puzzled by the phenomenon, which disappears as quickly as it had shown up. However, one morning six months later, Scott, who is 6Â ft 1Â in (1.85Â m) tall and 190 pounds (86Â kg), notices that his shirt and slacks seem to be too big, but blames it on the laundry service. As this trend continues, he believes he is shrinking and sees his physician, Dr. Bramson (William Schallert), who reassures him that he is in perfect health and that \\"people just don't get shorter.\\" Louise also dismisses his fears as silly, stating that he has simply been losing weight, but he continues to lose height and weight. His wedding ring falls off his finger. Louise becomes concerned when Scott points out that she no longer needs to stand on tiptoe to kiss him. Finally, there is x-ray proof that Scott is getting smaller. His doctor refers him to the prominent laboratory, the California Medical Research Institute, and after nearly three weeks of sophisticated tests, Scott and his team of new doctors learn that the mist to which he was exposed was radioactive. This, combined with an accidental exposure to a large amount of common insecticide four months later, has set off a chain reaction that has rearranged Scott's molecular structure, causing his cells to shrink. Scott continues to shrink proportionately. His story hits the headlines, and he becomes a national curiosity. He can no longer drive a car and has to give up his job working for his brother, Charlie (Paul Langton), who encourages him to make some money off his story by selling it to the national press.

In this scenario, he decided to get a heavier tile to replace the damaged component. Among the given options - roof, home, fabric, floor, and computer game - the most suitable option to answer the question would be \\"roof\\".  A roof is an integral part of a building's structure, providing protection from the elements, such as wind, rain, and snow. Typically, roofs are made of different materials that offer varying levels of durability and resistance to environmental conditions. In this case, the original roof tiles were likely damaged due to their inability to withstand the forces of the windstorm. With this in mind, the decision to replace the damaged tiles with heavier ones is a wise one. Heavier roof tiles are often more durable and better at resisting the forces of nature, such as high winds and heavy snow loads. Furthermore, they can offer improved insulation, leading to a more energy-efficient home. In some cases, heavier tiles might also have a longer life expectancy, reducing the need for regular maintenance and replacement costs. However, it is important to note that installing heavier roof tiles should be done with caution. The existing structure of the roof must be able to support the additional weight, and an evaluation by a structural engineer or a qualified roofing contractor may be necessary to ensure that the roof can adequately handle the new tiles. In conclusion, given the context of the question - the need for a more durable and robust solution following the windstorm - the best-suited answer from the provided options would be \\"roof.\\" This choice reflects the need to enhance the resiliency of the building envelope and provides a stronger defense against the elements."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Movie title: Still Crazy Movie plot: \\"History teaches us that men behave wisely . . . once they've exhausted all other alternatives. For most rock bands, the pursuit of wisdom's a low priority compared to fame, fortune and fornication. Such a band was Strange Fruit.\\" Thus begins the opening dialog of Hughie, (Billy Connolly) as he launches into a brief history of the British band: in the late 1970's Strange Fruit, consisting of guitarist Brian Lovell (Bruce Robinson), his brother and lead singer Keith, keyboard player Tony Costello (Stephen Rea), bassist Les Wickes (Jimmy Nail) and drummer Beano Baggot (Timothy Spall) were HUGE. When Keith died of a drug overdose, he was replaced on vocals by Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Watched over by road-dog Hughie and Girl Friday Karen (Juliet Aubrey), they soldiered on until the disastrous appearance at the open-air Wisbech (U.K.) Rock Festival, when lightning struck the stage during their opening number. The already-contentious band members decided it was a sign and immediately broke up forever (all this in the first five minutes of the film). Forever, that is, until in the present (OK, 1998) Tony is spotted on Ibeza (he now stocks condoms in the restrooms at the resorts there) by the son of the Wisbech promoter, who wants to put together a 20th anniversary reunion concert with all the original acts. Tony seeks out Karen, now a divorced mother who coordinates conferences for a major hotel, suggesting a possible reunion. She is ambivalent, as is Les (now a successful roofer with a family) and Ray (a struggling solo artist with a demanding second wife -- Swedish -- and a mansion he can't afford). Beano, working in a floral nursery and hounded by the Inland Revenue (the U.K.'s IRS) is the only immediately enthusiastic bandmate. They arrange a meeting, where Karen informs them that she's tracked Brian and found his music royalties are being distributed per a bequest in his will, provoking Beano to compassionately ask if that means \\"the silly sod's dead?\\" The band again soldiers on.

At the start of the 1910s, the decade would begin with the Panic of 1910–1911 stifling economic growth for a lengthy period of time. History would later take its course on July 30, 1914; as the average stood at a level of 71.42 when a decision was made to close down the New York Stock Exchange, and suspend trading for a span of four and a half months. Some historians believe the exchange closed because of a concern that markets would plunge as a result of panic over the onset of World War I. An alternative explanation is that the Secretary of the Treasury, William Gibbs McAdoo, closed the exchange to conserve the U.S. gold stock in order to launch the Federal Reserve System later that year, with enough gold to keep the United States on par with the gold standard. When the markets reopened on December 12, 1914, the index closed at 74.56, a gain of 4.4 percent. This is frequently reported as a large drop, due to using a later redefinition. Reports from the time say that the day was positive. Following World War I, the United States would experience another economic downturn, the post-World War I recession. The Dows performance would remain unchanged from the closing value of the previous decade, adding only 8.26%, from 99.05 points at the beginning of 1910, to a level of 107.23 points at the end of 1919. How many points higher was the closing of the Dow at the end of 1919 compared to the beginning of 1910?","output":"To find the difference in points between the closing of the Dow at the end of 1919 and the beginning of 1910, we will subtract the starting value from the ending value. The Dow closed at 107.23 points at the end of 1919 and at 99.05 points at the beginning of 1910. Step 1: Subtract the starting value from the ending value. 107.23 (end value) - 99.05 (start value) = 8.18 points So, the closing of the Dow was 8.18 points higher at the end of 1919 compared to the beginning of 1910."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film opens with long lines of tired and grim soldiers and civilians moving through a congested town away from the advancing Japanese (who are not shown but the hopelessness of the situation hangs heavy). Sergeant Bill Dane (Robert Taylor) of the 31st Infantry and his companion Corporal Jake Feingold (Thomas Mitchell) are seen manning a defensive position. They casually discuss the possibility that they will be ordered to retreat again back toward the presumed safety of Bataan.Their commander orders them to report to a Captain Lassister for a special assignment. The town then suffers a violent Japanese air attack with civilians and soldiers caught in the open and killed. Dane and Feingold reach Lassiter. A pretty American nurse boards the last ambulance out while casting a long, soulful look back at Lassier (Lee Bowman). Lassiter puts Dane in charge of a group of 13 men, all of whom had been separated from their commands, with orders to hold a a strategic bridge after the last refugees cross. Lassiter makes it clear they are to demolish the bridge, stop the \\"Japs\\", and hold until MacArthur can consolidate in Bataan. They are given such equipment and supplies as is available and left alone.After the army and some civilians cross the bridge, Dane, Feingold, and a group of eleven hastily assembled soldiers from different units is assigned to blow it up and delay Japanese rebuilding efforts as long as possible. In addition to Sgt. Dane, Cpl. Feingold and Captain Lassier, the rear guard is a mixed lot, making up of:Corporal Barney Todd (Lloyd Nolan), who claims to be a signalman;Private Felix Ramirez (Desi Arnaz), a Mexican American California National Guardsman;Private Wesley Epps (Kenneth Lee Spencer), a black demolitions expert;Private Matthew Hardy (Phillip Terry), a conscientious objector in the Medical Corps;Private Francis X. Matowski (Barry Nelson), an engineer;Private \\"Yankee\\" Salazar (Alex Havier), a Philippine Scout;Private Sam Molloy (Tom Dugan), a cook;Seaman Leonard Purckett (Robert Walker), a... Answer:","output":"Considering the movie plot described, a possible question to generate could be:  \\"How does the diverse background of the rear guard soldiers contribute to their collective struggle to accomplish their mission, and how do their individual strengths and weaknesses impact the overall success of holding the strategic bridge?\\"  This question encourages an exploration of the dynamics among the group of 13 soldiers from varying backgrounds and experiences. It prompts an analysis of their collaboration and the development of personal growth within each character as they face a seemingly hopeless task, ultimately demonstrating the resilience of the human spirit. Throughout the film, Sergeant Bill Dane, Corporal Jake Feingold, Captain Lassier, and the other members of the rear guard come from a wide array of backgrounds and possess a range of skills and abilities. The unique richness of this diverse group allows for a more profound exploration of human nature and the capacity to unite in the face of adversity. Corporal Barney Todd, the signalman, is able to contribute through his crucial knowledge of communication systems, while Private Felix Ramirez, the Mexican American National Guardsman, brings his resourcefulness and military experience to the team. Private Wesley Epps, the black demolitions expert, is instrumental in carrying out the main objective of blowing up the bridge and delaying the Japanese forces, and Private Matthew Hardy, the conscientious objector, provides medical assistance caring for the wounded soldiers. As an engineer, Private Francis X. Matowski plays a vital role in strategic planning, while Private \\"Yankee\\" Salazar, the Philippine Scout, offers his local knowledge and survival skills. In contrast, Private Sam Molloy, the cook, and Leonard Purckett struggle to prove their value as soldiers in a military setting, but their contrasting backgrounds and unique perspectives also enhance the group's overall ability to adapt and manage the challenges they face. Each participating soldier's unique skills, beliefs, and experiences contribute differently to the ultimate success or failure of holding the strategic bridge. Furthermore, exploring how both the soldiers' individual strengths and weaknesses affect the group dynamic and the overall mission provides an opportunity to delve deeper into themes of loyalty, self-discovery, sacrifice, and perseverance. The story demonstrates that when individuals come together to achieve a common goal, their varied abilities can complement each other, resulting in a more robust and effective outcome. In conclusion, the question generated from the movie plot aims to analyze the impact of the rear guard soldiers' diverse backgrounds on their collective struggle to complete their mission and how this dynamic influences the overall success or failure of stopping the Japanese forces at the strategic bridge. By exploring these aspects, the film's core themes of unity, resilience, and hope emerge more vividly, providing a compelling narrative and a deeper understanding of the human spirit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: After what entities are German dialects traditionally named? Answer: German dialectology traditionally names the major dialect groups after Germanic tribes from which they were assumed to have descended.[citation needed]  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: German dialects are traditionally named after the Germanic tribes or linguistic regions from which they were assumed to have descended or originated. The major German dialect groups have features that can be geographically as well as historically linked to the early Germanic tribes that populated the areas. These tribes had their own distinct languages and cultural identities, which later evolved into the various dialects we recognize today. The main German dialect groups are: 1. Low German (Plattdeutsch or Niederdeutsch): This group of dialects is traditionally associated with the Saxon tribes, which inhabited the lowlands of Northern Germany and the eastern Netherlands. Low German dialects share phonetic and grammatical features with Old Saxon, the historical language of these tribes. Low German dialects are further divided into West Low German and East Low German. 2. High German (Hochdeutsch): These dialects originated in the southern and central German-speaking regions. High German dialects are named after various Germanic tribes that inhabited the highlands, such as the Alemanni, Bavarians, and Franks. High German dialects are divided into two main groups:    a. Upper German (Oberdeutsch): Associated with the Alemanni and Bavarians, Upper German dialects include Alemannic, Swabian, East Franconian, South Franconian, and Bavarian-Austrian dialects. These dialects are spoken in the areas that were inhabited by the Alemanni and Bavarians, including southern Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and the Alsace region in France.    b. Central German (Mitteldeutsch): This group of dialects is associated primarily with the tribes of the Franks and Thuringians, who lived in the central region of Germany. Central German dialects include Ripuarian, Moselle Franconian, Rhine Franconian, Thuringian, and Upper Saxon. These dialects are spoken in areas stretching from the Rhineland in the west to Saxony-Anhalt in the east. 3. East Middle German (Ostmitteldeutsch): This group of dialects is associated with the Slavic settlement in Eastern Germany, mainly populated by the Sorbs, who currently still speak the Sorbian language in some parts of Eastern Germany. The influence of their language and culture is apparent on the regional dialects of East Middle German group. Apart from these main dialect groups, there are several smaller dialects that are spoken in specific regions or communities within Germany. Some of these dialects are highly localized and may only be spoken by a small fraction of the population. Examples of these smaller dialects include Silesian, Luxembourgish, and Yiddish. In conclusion, German dialects are traditionally named after the Germanic tribes or linguistic regions where they originated. However, it is essential to recognize that while these historical associations offer a useful starting point for understanding the development of German dialects, languages and dialects are constantly evolving and influenced by various socio-historical factors. This means that the dialects spoken today are not simply direct descendants of the languages spoken by these tribes but rather an intricate fusion of various linguistic and cultural influences over the centuries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, with a smile on my lips, I follow him outside to the beautifully sunlit patio where a light breeze is enough to bring the smell of freshly bloomed flowers. As we settle down in the comfortable patio chairs, he carefully places his guitar on his lap and starts tuning it. As he adjusts each string to perfection, his fingers skillfully dance across the fretboard, producing sounds that are both harmonic and ethereal. I can't help but feel captivated by the sight and feel a sense of anticipation for the music he's about to share with me. He looks up at me and says, \\"All right, I've got a couple of ideas I'd like you to listen to, and I need your opinion on which one to use for the song I'm working on for Brennan.\\" He explains that Brennan's favorite kind of music is alternative rock with a touch of acoustic, so he's trying to create a track that seamlessly blends both elements. I nod in understanding and take a deep breath, mentally preparing myself for the task ahead. He starts playing the first idea, strumming the chords effortlessly. The melody is smooth, rhythmic, and full of emotion, evoking a sense of nostalgia and carrying me away to a place of memories and self-reflection. It's enchanting, to say the least. As he moves on to the second idea, I notice a shift in the mood. This time, the melody has a playful rhythm that makes me want to tap my foot in sync with the beat. The chords swell and contract, making it feel like we're riding an emotional wave that is equal parts exhilarating and calming. He finishes playing both ideas and looks at me expectantly. I take a few moments to gather my thoughts, appreciating the uniqueness of each melody. Unable to choose one over the other, I finally suggest that he combines elements from both compositions, creating a dynamic piece that is infused with feelings of nostalgia, love, and youthful energy. He ponders over my suggestion and nods in agreement, saying that I might have just unlocked the perfect blend he was searching for. We spend the rest of the afternoon experimenting and refining the song, feeding off of each other's creative energy to craft something that we feel would truly resonate with Brennan. As the sun begins to dip below the horizon, we wrap up our jam session, both of us feeling a sense of fulfillment from the day's collaboration. The music we've created today is not just a product of our individual talents, but rather it is a testament to the power of working together and drawing inspiration from one another. I look over at him, still holding his guitar, and smile. \\"Pun intended,\\" I say with a laugh, elbowing him gently. Me: \\"I think we've created something truly special here.\\" We both know it's time to send our masterpiece off to Brennan, confident in our creation and in the knowledge that we've given it our all. The sun sets on the day, the shadows lengthening, and our spirits lifted by the birth of a new song that we hope will touch Brennan's soul as much as it has touched ours."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick  and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in Morocco to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an eidetic memory. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to MI6 when he returns to London. Perry turns the information over to MI6 agent Hector, the investigator in charge. The information provided by Dima enables Hector and his supervisor Billy to witness a meeting between the Prince and corrupt politician Aubrey Longrigg. Billy refuses to sanction an investigation on a chance meeting. Hector continues regardless and recruits the MacKendricks to help stage a chance encounter with Dima in France. There, Dima provides all the names of his clients and confirms each banker and politician involved has received £5 million each for their endorsement of the new bank, with Longrigg receiving £30 million. Dima refuses to provide the bank account numbers that would verify the corruption until he and his family have been granted asylum in London. Answer:","output":"Dima gives the information to Hector through Perry MacKendrick. In the story, Dima gives Perry a USB stick that contains information linking corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. After returning to London, Perry then hands over the USB stick to MI6 agent Hector, the investigator in charge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: How can someone listen to vinyl? Possible A: record store, car, omlinr, wallpaper, record albums  Why is \\"record albums\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","output":"\\"Record albums\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the question of how to listen to vinyl. Vinyl records, also known as phonograph records, are a type of physical storage media for recorded music. They were especially popular before the rise of CDs and digital music, and have recently seen a resurgence among audiophiles and collectors. Record albums refer to collections of vinyl records that typically consist of multiple tracks, often arranged in a particular order by the artist or record label. These albums are stored in covers that usually feature artwork, liner notes, and other information about the music. To listen to vinyl, one needs a record player (also known as turntable or phonograph), which works by spinning the vinyl and having a stylus (needle) follow the grooves etched on the record's surface. The stylus picks up vibrations from the grooves and translates them into electrical signals, which are then amplified and converted back into sound by the speakers. In the context of the question, \\"record store\\" is also a common sense answer since it is a place where vinyl records, including record albums, can be purchased. People can then acquire the desired records and play them on their turntables to listen to the music. The other three options provided – car, omlinr (which seems to be a typo, possibly meant to say \\"online\\"), and wallpaper – do not align with human common sense as they do not have a direct connection to listening to vinyl. Cars generally don't have turntables, online refers to digital media, and wallpaper is unrelated to audio playback."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla.  - Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).  - The common dolphin is the name given to two species ( and possibly a third ) of dolphin making up the genus Delphinus . Prior to the mid- 1990s , most taxonomists only recognised one species in this genus , the common dolphin Delphinus delphis . Modern cetologists usually recognise two species -- the short - beaked common dolphin , which retains the systematic name Delphinus delphis , and the long - beaked common dolphin Delphinus capensis . The common dolphin is not the dolphin of popular imagination despite its name ; that distinction belongs to the bottlenose dolphin due to its widespread use in marine parks and its appearance in the television series Flipper . However , this dolphin was the most frequently represented in the art and literature of ancient Greece and Rome .  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Oceanic dolphins or Delphinidae are a widely distributed family of dolphins that live in the sea. Thirty extant species are described. They include several big species whose common names contain \\"whale\\" rather than \\"dolphin\\", such as the killer whale and the pilot whales. Delphinidae is a family within the superfamily Delphinoidea, which also includes the porpoises (Phocoenidae) and the Monodontidae (beluga whale and narwhal). River dolphins are relatives of the Delphinoidea.  - River dolphins are a widely distributed group of fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water. They are an informal grouping of dolphins, which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. The river dolphins comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the Indian dolphins), Iniidae (the Amazonian dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins). There are five extant species of river dolphins, and two subspecies. River dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.  - Iniidae is a family of river dolphins containing one living and four extinct genera.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Porpoises are a group of fully aquatic marine mammals that are sometimes referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible difference between the two groups is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.  - Cetacea are a widely distributed and diverse clade of aquatic mammals that today consists of the whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Cetaceans are carnivorous and finned. Most species live in the sea, some in rivers. The name is derived from the Latin \\"cetus\\" \\"whale\\" and Greek \\"ketos\\" \\"huge fish\\".  - Dolphins are a widely distributed and diverse group of aquatic mammals. They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates.

Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The coal is broken down to a smaller material - The coal particles mix with hot air and move in to a boiler - Water in the boiler is pumped and produces steam with the coal - Steam powers turbine blades, which magnetically charge wire coals - The water returns back in to its chamber and the process is repeated - Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is the extraction and transportation of coal from a coal mine to the coal-fired power plant.  Here is the revised and detailed process: 1. Extraction and transportation of coal: Coal is extracted from underground and surface mines using various mining techniques, including both manual labor and highly mechanized methods such as surface mining, underground mining, mountaintop removal, and open-pit mining. Once extracted, the coal is then transported to the coal-fired power plant by means such as conveyor belts, trucks, trains, or barges, depending on the distance, terrain, and available infrastructure. 2. Coal processing and preparation: Upon arrival at the power plant, the coal undergoes processing and preparation to remove impurities and obtain the required size of coal particles. This may involve techniques such as washing, crushing, and screening, which help to improve the combustion efficiency of the coal and reduce pollutant emissions during the burning process. 3. Breaking down the coal: The coal is crushed or pulverized into smaller particles, generally less than 2mm in size, to ensure an efficient and complete combustion process. By breaking it down, the coal can be more easily mixed with hot air and sent into the boiler. 4. Mixing coal particles with hot air: The pulverized coal particles are then mixed with hot air, which is pre-heated to a high temperature. This mixture enables the coal to burn more efficiently and helps transport it into the boiler. 5. Combustion in the boiler: As the coal and hot air mixture enters the boiler, it ignites and burns intensely. This combustion process generates significant heat, which is absorbed by the water-filled boiler tubes that surround the combustion chamber. 6. Steam generation: The heat from the combustion process is transferred to the water in the boiler, causing it to heat up and convert into steam. This high-pressure steam is forced through the boiler and directed toward the turbine blades. 7. Power generation: The high-pressure steam flows over the turbine blades, causing them to spin and drive the generator. As the blades rotate, they create a rotating magnetic field, which induces an electric current in the wire coils within the generator. This generates electricity that can be transmitted to the power grid. 8. Condensing the steam: After passing through the turbine, the steam loses its heat and condenses back into water. This condensed water is collected and returned to the boiler, where it undergoes the same process of heating and turning into steam again. 9. Recirculation of water and process repetition: The water is continuously recirculated through the system to maintain a steady supply of steam, ensuring that the power plant can continue to generate electricity. This closed-loop process repeats continuously as long as there is a supply of coal and the necessary conditions are maintained within the power plant. In summary, the missing first step involves the extraction and transportation of coal from its source to the coal-fired power plant, which precedes the series of steps required to convert coal into electricity efficiently and safely."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: Florida Teen Charged with Statutory Rape: A Case of Homophobia or Justice? The recent case of a Florida teen charged with statutory rape and expelled from school has stirred up controversies worldwide, with many speculating about whether this case is based on homophobia. As reported by the Raw Story, Kaitlyn Hunt, an 18-year-old girl, has been accused by the parents of the alleged victim, a girl three years younger than her, of having a non-consensual sexual relationship. Kaitlyn's mother, Kelly Hunt Smith, has claimed that the charges are primarily driven by the bigoted and homophobic attitude of the younger girl's religious parents. The controversy began when Kaitlyn and the other teen started dating and were involved in what Kaitlyn's mother describes as a \\"mutual consenting relationship.\\" However, the younger girl's parents, allegedly offended by their daughter being in a relationship with another girl, reported Kaitlyn to the authorities. According to Smith, the parents blamed her daughter for \\"making\\" their child gay, leading them to push for Kaitlyn's expulsion from school. Following the charges and expulsion, Kaitlyn was forced to finish her school year at another institution. The plea deal offered by the prosecution now has her facing two years of house arrest and a year's probation. Her mother, Kelly Hunt Smith, firmly believes that these severe consequences are a result of the hatred and discrimination harbored by the alleged victim's parents. In a Facebook post, Smith claims that the parents \\"see being gay as a sin and wrong\\" and that \\"they were out to destroy my daughter.\\" As news of the case began to garner widespread attention, public support for Kaitlyn's plight has grown exponentially. A Facebook group advocating for Kaitlyn has now amassed nearly 20,000 members, while an online petition urging the prosecutors to drop the charges has gathered over 53,000 signatures. Despite the rising support for Kaitlyn, the prosecution maintains that the charges against her are not motivated by discrimination or homophobia. Instead, they argue that the case strictly revolves around the legal issue of statutory rape, as the younger girl was below the age of consent in their state. Arguments have been made on behalf of Kaitlyn, claiming that the legal prosecution in this scenario is unjustly harsh, given that the relationship was said to have been consensual and driven by love. Many argue that the backlash and consequences Kaitlyn is facing are a direct result of the pervasive discrimination against LGBTQ individuals. On the other hand, those who believe the charges are justified argue that law enforcement should apply the law consistently and dispassionately, regardless of the sex or orientation of the individuals involved. They argue that failing to do so would create a dangerous precedent that may expose the youth to abuse by individuals who seek to evade legal consequences simply because they identify as LGBTQ. In conclusion, the Kaitlyn Hunt case is a deeply polarizing and complicated issue, with many unanswered questions surrounding the merits of the prosecution's charges and the influence of homophobia. While public opinion appears to be overwhelmingly in favor of Kaitlyn, it is ultimately up to the legal system to determine the truth of this case and to uphold the principles of justice and fairness for all, regardless of sexual orientation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn (; 11 December 1918 - 3 August 2008) was a Russian novelist, historian, and short story writer. He was an outspoken critic of the Soviet Union and communism and helped to raise global awareness of its Gulag forced labor camp system. He was allowed to publish only one work in the Soviet Union, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (1962), in the periodical Novy Mir. Solzhenitsyn was born in Kislovodsk, RSFSR (now in Stavropol Krai, Russia). His mother, Taisiya Zakharovna (nee Shcherbak) was of Ukrainian descent. Her father had risen from humble beginnings to become a wealthy landowner, acquiring a large estate in the Kuban region in the northern foothills of the Caucasus. During World War I, Taisiya went to Moscow to study. While there she met and married Isaakiy Solzhenitsyn, a young officer in the Imperial Russian Army of Cossack origins and fellow native of the Caucasus region. The family background of his parents is vividly brought to life in the opening chapters of August 1914, and in the later Red Wheel novels.  In 1918, Taisia became pregnant with Aleksandr. On 15 June, shortly after her pregnancy was confirmed, Isaakiy was killed in a hunting accident. Aleksandr was raised by his widowed mother and aunt in lowly circumstances. His earliest years coincided with the Russian Civil War. By 1930 the family property had been turned into a collective farm. Later, Solzhenitsyn recalled that his mother had fought for survival and that they had to keep his father's background in the old Imperial Army a secret. His educated mother (who never remarried) encouraged his literary and scientific learnings and raised him in the Russian Orthodox faith; she died in 1944.  As early as 1936, Solzhenitsyn began developing the characters and concepts for a planned epic work on World War I and the Russian Revolution. This eventually led to the novel August 1914; some of the chapters he wrote then still survive. Solzhenitsyn studied mathematics at Rostov State University. At the same time he took correspondence courses from the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History, at this time heavily ideological in scope. As he himself makes clear, he did not question the state ideology or the superiority of the Soviet Union until he spent time in the camps.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Tell all: Sharon Savoy has written a book about her life as a professional ballroom dancer. On the popular BBC series Strictly Come Dancing, the professional dancers and their celebrity partners are often seen to become the best of friends, supporting one another throughout the competition. The reality of competing on the ballroom dance circuit is somewhat different, according to three times world champion, Sharon Savoy, who is lifting the lift on the sequin-filled world in a new book. She told MailOnline: 'It's a competition, not a performance. So the normal tension and rivalries are heightened. It is rare to. develop a true friendship with your competitors, like you would see in a. dance company. 'Backstage is an interesting dichotomy. Beneath the. seemingly calm and composed exterior is a cauldron bubbling with nerves,. anxious tension and pent up energy. Most of the dancers pace until. their event is called and remind me of the energy of thoroughbred horses. at the starting gate.' Chicago-born Sharon, who trained at the School of American Ballet, said despite the fierce rivalry, attempts to sabotage the performance of a fellow competitor are thankfully rare. 'I have never heard of anything so. terrible and tragic as the acid incident at the Bolshoi,' she said, referring to the time in 2013 when tensions at Russia's rival ballet companies turned violent and dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko threw acid on the face of artistic director, Sergei Filin. Sharon said a dancers' worst enemy can often be the judge, rather than their competitor, as 'politics' means the best performer doesn't necessarily win. 'Many. talented ballroom dancers leave the competition circuit when they tire. of the politics. My book speaks about the politics in ballroom dance,. which has been a taboo subject. Anytime you. have a decision based on human opinion there will be controversy,' she said. 'The. winner of a ballroom competition is not defined by who crosses the. finish line first. What opens the door for \\"politics\\" to exist in. ballroom dance competitions is the fact that our current system allows. the coaches to also judge. It would be akin to allowing a barrister to. also preside as judge of a legal case.' Champ: Sharon, performing one of her routines, has won national and international titles. Politics aside, Sharon said she loves every aspect of the dance world - but success has not been easy. She's worked hard to become a U.S. and World champion, making sacrifices along the way. 'To become a top ranked professional. ballroom dancer, you must live, breath, eat dance 24/7,' she explained. 'Nothing else. can matter more, not relationships, family or comforts. Your passion. must be all consuming and borderline obsessive to make it through the. eye of the needle. 'George Balanchine, one of my early mentors, and. director of the New York City ballet said it best, \\"I don't want dancers. who want to dance, I want dancers that need to dance.\\"' But Sharon said the sacrifices are worth it to reap the rewards of being a professional ballroom dancer. 'The lifestyle of a top ranked ballroom. dancer is a page out of the \\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\\",' she said. 'If you \\"make it\\" and become the champion, you travel all over the world to. compete, perform and teach. It's a very glamorous way to see the world. and get paid to do what you love most - dance! Glamorous: The dancer, pictured in her youth, said she never gets tired of the sequins or elaborate make-up. 'I have had the pleasure to. perform in China, Japan, Taiwan, Russia, Australia, North and South. America, Europe, The Royal Albert Hall and in Hollywood movies.' Of course, the make-up and outfits all add to the glamour and Sharon said as a professional dancer, you can never have too much sparkle, tassles or fake tan. 'There's a saying that \\"you can never be too rich or too thin\\" - in the ballroom dance world, you can never be too tan!' she joked. She added: 'Hair color is usually extreme - platinum blonde, flaming red or jet black. Make-up is exaggerated; eyelashes, eyebrows and lips are all accentuated. In a sea of competitors it's important to stand out and be the most exotic or colourful fish.' As for the costumes, they are always 'exquisite'. Political: Sharon said being the best dancer doesn't always guarantee victory. 'The amount of time and attention to detail that goes into designing these lavish creations is similar to the fashion world's obsession with every facet of a piece of clothing,' she said. As well as looking lavish, the costumes must allow the performers to have freedom to move. Sharon says she never gets fed up of the sparkly costumes or make-up that are necessary for a ballroom or Latin dance routine. 'It's part of the fun and fantasy - to become larger than life, to be sexier or more provocative or more elegant than you can be in normal daily life,' she said. Ballroom!

Animal tracker Ivan Marx opens by mentioning the film is the culmination of 10 years of research. He says that the Eskimos called the creature \\"bushman,\\" the Colville Indians \\"Sasquatch,\\" and the Hoopas \\"Om-mah,\\" but is most commonly known as Bigfoot. Marx's brother-in-law takes him to the land of petrified wood, showing him rock carvings of creatures with big hands and feet. The carvings tell the story of the creature stealing children, causing a village to be abandoned. Marx finds large tracks in the snow and later a dead bear with similar tracks nearby. He finds strange hair between the bear's teeth and sets out to track the creature. He finds tracks in the mud beside a river and something moving nearby. He intends to inform others but rain washes the tracks away. Marx investigates tracks in several states only to find they're not bigfoot tracks. He visits the Oh-mah bigfoot redwood statue in northern California and the Oregon coast, continuing to search. Marx takes a job in Washington state to film a Cinnamon bear. While there, he films Bigfoot walking through a field. He mentions that his footage of Bigfoot has been questioned by science and used by others on lecture circuits to make money. Marx shows footage of an injured squirrel, goats eating dirt, and glaciers melting. He mentions the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and visits Yukon Frida, who paints pictures of Bigfoot.

In most English-speaking regions, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, \\"suburb\\" has become largely synonymous with what is called a \\"neighborhood\\" in other countries and the term extends to inner city areas. In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. In others, such as Arabia, Canada, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county.  - Commuter rail, also called suburban rail, is a passenger rail transport service that primarily operates between a city centre, and the middle to outer suburbs beyond 15 km (10 miles) and commuter towns or other locations that draw large numbers of commuterspeople who travel on a daily basis.

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.

Pick from: -no; -yes;","output":"-no; The correct answer is \\"no.\\" The paragraph states that the Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations.

Plot title: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea Movie plot: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is a film by Richard Fleischer based on the famous Jules Verne novel written in the 19th century. The film begins with the first page of the book, talking about rumors of a mysterious sea monster that prowled the South Seas in 1868. The camera switches to an old-fashioned ship sailing through apparently calm seas. A long, dark object with glowing lights like eyes at its head appears a short distance away from the ship. It drives straight toward the ship, making a loud whirring noise of a motor. It collides head-on with the ship, sinking it, and sails off. A man standing before a crowd in San Francisco offers a bonus to any man who will ship with an expedition to hunt the mysterious \\"monster\\". Another man interrupts him, warning the crowd not to sign; they will never make it back to collect their pay. He brings up an elderly seaman who tells a dramatic story of how the \\"monster\\" sunk the ship he was on, and proceeds to give a vivid description of the monster. A young sailor, Ned Land, challenges the old sailor's claim and makes fun of the way his breath smells. His companion, Casey, hits him over the head with the sailor's cane and a fight breaks out. The police arrive and drag Ned Land away. Farther down the street, French professor Pierre Aronnax and his apprentice, Conseil, are trying to find a ship that will take them to Saigon, but are told that no one will sail through the South Seas. Three reporters ask for a statement from the professor about the monster, but he gives them an ambiguous answer.

Chris is working in a lab that handles radioactive materials. Today he is working with Element A and Element B. When measuring element A he notes that is has a shorter wavelength than element B.  Will an element with a long wavelength have more or less energy when compared to an element with a short wavelength?  Hint: Electromagnetic radiation is energy that travels in waves across space as well as through matter. Most of the electromagnetic radiation on Earth comes from the sun. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves are characterized by certain wavelengths and wave frequencies. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy.","output":"Based on the given hints, electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy.  In this case, Chris noted that Element A has a shorter wavelength than Element B.

At the moment, he is trying to bring down his former partner Gabriel Callahan, who has become a drug kingpin. Callahan is trying to, and slowly succeeding at, taking over the New Orleans underworld. Stowe botches a sting operation against Callahan, resulting in the death of fellow cop Maria Ronson, whose fiancée, fellow cop Van Huffel, nearly comes to blows with him over it. Chief Mac Baylor has a very blunt chat with Stowe, who is dismissive. Stowe is approached by fellow cop Walter Curry to help his nephew beat a drug-dealing charge; he instead turns Curry over to Baylor, who fires him. After barricading himself in the station bathroom, Walter confronts an unrepentant Stowe and condemns him for betraying his fellow officers. That night Stowe meets with his estranged wife, Valerie, who tells him that she's pregnant, but that he's not the father. Valerie, whose marriage with Stowe is close to collapse, has been seeing a man named Mark Rossini, the gym teacher at the school she is principal of. But he may not be the father either. Stowe brashly accuses Valerie of being impregnated by Callahan, and she tells him she never wants to see him again. The only thing keeping Stowe from total collapse is his dogged pursuit of Callahan. But he drunkenly stumbles into an ambush masterminded by Callahan, and is shot in the head by Callahan's right-hand man Jimmy. Stowe undergoes emergency surgery, and ends up in a coma.

Article: Everybody knows that colors are connected with certain feelings. For example, why do some people paint the walls of their rooms yellow and others pink? The same is true in stores. They want us to feel something when we look at their products. Green, for example, tries to show the quality of a product: how good it is for us or for our environment. It also suggests that the product is healthier, has less fat and maybe fewer calories. Red, on the other hand is an aggressive color that is often used for packaging food. Red wants us to become hungry or thirsty. Purple is a kind of color that is often seen as royal. It indicates that it is something special. Producers use purple to show that something is of good quality. Blue is not very often found in food packaging because there are not very many foods that have a blue color. Colors can also have different meaning in different cultures and countries. For example, while the color white is used in many Western countries to represent purity and innocence, it is seen as a symbol of mourning in many Eastern countries. The Egyptian pharaohs  wore white crowns. A white sale is a sale of sheets, towels, and other bed and bath items. A white flag is the universal symbol for truce . A white elephant is a rare, pale elephant sacred  to the people of India, Thailand, Burma, and Sri Lanka. In these countries, something that is a white elephant is either a possession that costs more than it is worth to keep or an item that the owner doesn't want but can't get rid of. Consumers are aware that certain foods must have certain colors. When Pepsi brought out a crystal clear cola in 1992, it thought that consumers would buy it because clear meant pure and healthy. After a few months Pepsi found out that a cola had to be dark-colored. Crystal Pepsi failed and the company pulled it off the market. Advertising professionals often need to look at a product through the consumers' eyes when choosing a color. The right packaging colors can truly improve the sales of a product but choosing...

British detectives hunting for Madeleine McCann today issued two e-fits of a suspect seen carrying a little blonde girl near in Praia da Luz on the night she disappeared. Scotland Yard say a family saw him cradling a child in pyjamas, aged around three, and walking away towards the beach in Praia da Luz, Portugal at around 10pm. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said today he could be the man who took Madeleine on May 3, 2007, and that tracing him was of 'vital importance'. Detectives say the suspect is white, aged 20 to 40 with short brown hair, medium height. and build, and clean-shaven. The images, based on statements from two key witnesses, differ – but each shows him with an intense stare and a hint of a smile. Scroll down for video. Suspect: The two e-fit images of the same man seen in Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine disappeared. Scotland Yard detectives released the computer generated images ahead of a BBC1 Crimewatch appeal tonight, which they hope will result in a major breakthrough. The programme features a reconstruction of the events leading up to Madeleine’s disappearance in Praia da Luz on Thursday, May 3, 2007. Madeleine is portrayed gathering tennis balls in echoes of one of the photographs used during the search for her. A short clip released ahead of the broadcast shows Gerry and Kate McCann drawing the curtains to their apartment before joining friends in a tapas restaurant. The reconstruction shows the moment Madeleine was taken from her bed. Prime Minister David Cameron gave his support to the investigation. 'I'm very pleased that Scotland Yard are doing this work,' he said. 'The Government has helped to fund the work that is being done. 'This was a crime that touched the heart of everyone in the country and everyone would like to see it resolved, so I hope Scotland Yard continue with their work and I wish them success.' Likeness: A three-year-old actress reenacts a game of tennis for the reconstruction (left) and a picture of Maddie on the court in 2007. TV reconstruction: Actors portray Kate and Gerry McCann having dinner with their friends in the resort. Night: Another scene shows Maddie's parents closing the curtains in their room on the night their daughter disappeared. The devastated couple – who found themselves suspects in the initial inquiry by Portuguese police – talk about how her disappearance has left a ‘huge hole’ in their family’s life. In a moving interview with Kirsty Young, Kate McCann says: ‘We’re not the ones that have done something wrong here. It’s the person who’s gone into that apartment and taken a little girl away from her family.’ Gerry McCann says: ‘When it’s a special occasion, when you should be your happiest and Madeleine’s not there, that’s when it really hits home.’ His wife adds: ‘It’s when you have big family occasions really. That’s it isn’t it? Family occasion and you haven’t got your complete family.’ Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, the senior investigating officer, will announce ‘a revelation moment’ in Scotland Yard’s £5million investigation. Officers will also release further e-fits – electronic facial identification technique images – of other potential suspects. They are keen to trace at least two German-speaking men who were seen in the Algarve resort that day. Emotional: An interview with Kate and Gerry McCann will also be shown during the special episode of Crimewatch tonight. Witnesses reported the sightings to Portuguese police, but little importance was placed on them at the time. Now Scotland Yard says tracing the man in the two e-fits is ‘one of the main priorities for the investigation’ after scrutinising the time frame when the abduction could have taken place. They are the first to be issued in relation to the Home Office-funded inquiry into the case. Detectives say their timeline and version of events surrounding Madeleine’s disappearance has ‘significantly changed’, making the two witness sightings far more significant than previously thought. Officers are keeping an open mind as to whether more than one person was responsible for the abduction, which they think may be linked to a series of break-ins at the resort. Disappeared: Madeleine went missing from the Portuguese holiday apartment in 2007 when she was three years old. Mr Redwood said: ‘Whilst this man may or may not be the key to unlocking this investigation, tracing and speaking to him is of vital importance to us. We have witnesses placing him in the resort area around the time of Madeleine’s disappearance. ‘This is far from our only line of inquiry and there will be e-fits released of other sightings as well, who we are equally keen to trace. These people were seen on the day of Madeleine’s disappearance and the days leading up to it.’ The focus of the hunt for Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, who would now be ten years old, will move to Germany this week when her parents are expected to travel there to make a TV appeal. On Wednesday the German channel ZDF will feature the BBC Crimewatch reconstruction and release sketches of two German-speaking men in their programme Aktenzeichen XY... Ungelost [File Reference XY... Unsolved]. Publicity for that programme says detectives are now going on the ‘offensive’, with inquiries focusing on Germany. It adds: ‘This is the reason why XY will show sketches of two men who appear to speak German and who have so far been paid little or no importance.’ The e-fits will also be shown on Dutch TV as the two ‘German speakers’ may have been Dutch – the accents sound similar. Tonight’s Crimewatch reconstruction will give the most detailed sequence ever made public of the events that led to Madeleine’s disappearance. Detectives believe her kidnappers may have been lurking in or near the McCanns’ holiday apartment as her father went to check on his children. Earlier inquiries focused on the period after that, but they now believe the 45 minutes before that could hold the key. Mr Redwood said: ‘Our work has significantly changed the accepted version of events and it has allowed us to highlight very specific appeal points. I hope that when the public see our investigative strands drawn together, it will bring in new information that moves our investigation forward.’ It emerged yesterday that Greater Manchester Police arrested a man who bragged about seeing Madeleine on a Mediterranean island weeks ago. The man claimed the missing girl had been ‘introduced’ to him. Police were informed after a barrister, who had a conversation with the man at a party in a Manchester suburb in August, reported his concerns. The man was arrested last month on suspicion of possession of drugs and conspiracy to distribute indecent images of children. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police refused to comment yesterday, but sources played down the significance of the arrest. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"- British detectives are searching for Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 3, 2007. - Two e-fits of a suspect carrying a little blonde girl near the location on the night she disappeared have been issued. - The suspect is described as white, aged 20 to 40, with short brown hair, medium height and build, and clean-shaven. - Scotland Yard is working on a £5 million investigation, with their timeline and version of events having 'significantly changed.' - Officers are now focusing on two German-speaking men seen in the Algarve resort on the day of Madeleine's disappearance. - Madeleine's parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, are expected to travel to Germany to make a TV appeal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.\\"? The answer is:","output":"Question: What factors contribute to Neptune's more varied weather compared to Uranus, and how does its distance from the Sun affect its surface temperature and internal heating? Answer: Neptune's more varied weather compared to Uranus is attributed to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune is over 50% farther from the Sun than Uranus and receives only 40% the amount of sunlight, their surface temperatures are almost the same. This is because Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun, while Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives.

Mr Trump tweeted: \\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than 4 billion. Cancel order!\\" The government has a contract with Boeing to build two or more new planes. The White House appeared to cast doubt on the figures quoted by Mr Trump. \\"Some of the statistics that have been cited, shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defence,\\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. The new planes would enter service around 2024. Boeing shares fell more than 1% after the president-elect's tweet, but recovered most of their losses in afternoon trading. Mr Trump would not fly on the new planes unless he won a second term in the 2020 election. The president-elect also announced on Tuesday that Japan's SoftBank has agreed to invest 50bn (Â£39.4bn) in the US aimed at creating 50,000 new jobs. Mr Trump revealed the plan after meeting SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son at Trump Tower. \\"Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!\\" he tweeted. In other developments: As president and commander-in-chief, Donald Trump will have the power to cancel the contract with Boeing for the new planes. But if he does, it could cost the US taxpayer even more as the new president tries to save money. The US government has already signed a contract with Boeing for 170m (Â£134m; â‚¬158m). Additional funding has also been earmarked for the two new planes. The Government Accountability Office - an independent government auditor - estimates the final cost will be 3.2bn. The planes are still in early design phases, though - much of the money has yet to be spent and has not had a chance to overrun the cost estimates. Negotiation between Boeing and the US government could cut some of the costs, but if Mr Trump pulls out of the Boeing contract entirely the country may lose the money it is already contracted to pay. Mr Trump now uses his own plane, but as president he would travel aboard Air Force One, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. He is known for his admiration of his Trump-branded Boeing 757 jet, boasting to Rolling Stone last year that his aircraft was \\"bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way\\". \\"Did you know it was featured on the Discovery Channel as the world's most luxurious jetliner?\\" he said at the time. The president-elect told reporters on Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York that Boeing was \\"doing a little bit of a number\\" and the cost was \\"ridiculous\\". \\"We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,\\" he added. Mr Trump's remarks came after the Chicago Tribune published a column early on Tuesday in which Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg suggested the president-elect roll back his anti-trade rhetoric. \\"If we do not lead when it comes to writing these [trade] rules, our competitors will write them for us,\\" Mr Muilenburg told the newspaper. The Government Accountability Office estimates that the project's overall cost will be 3.2bn, a figure that is expected to rise. The US Air Force said it had budgeted 2.7bn for the project, \\"but expects this number to change\\". Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher, in a statement, said: \\"We are currently under contract for 170m to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States. \\"We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the programme, allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\\"","output":"President-elect Donald Trump criticized Boeing's costs for the new Air Force One planes, calling for the cancelation of the order; while the White House cast doubt on the 4bn costs cited by Trump and the US Air Force budgeted 2.7bn, the Government Accountability Office estimates the total cost at 3.2bn."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Struggling to understand and control her newfound power, Mary encounters her mysterious and wise neighbor, Mr. Forrester, who offers to guide her in mastering her abilities. Together with Mr. Forrester and her small group of friends, Mary delves into the history of exorcists in her family to find more about her inherited abilities. Their research leads to the discovery of a dark secret. One of her ancestors, Reverend Edmund Hawthorne, sealed away his own soul in a cursed artifact, the Hawthorne Amulet, to gain immortality and uttered a prophecy that his soul will be expelled by the last of his lineage. However, if the prophecy does not come true, it threatens to unleash a dark and malevolent force upon the world.  Meanwhile, Mary starts noticing a series of strange and unexplained events happening around town. Locals begin to act strangely, detached and in some cases, violent.

Mary begins receiving cryptic messages regarding the Hawthorne Amulet in her dreams from an unknown source. As the supernatural occurrences escalate, Mary and her friends stumble upon the Hawthorne Amulet in a hidden room within the abandoned Hawthorne Mansion.

As they continue to protect her from agents of the cult, unmask them, and unveil further secrets behind Reverend Hawthorne's life, Mary questions who she can truly trust.  The climactic finale unfolds in the abandoned Hawthorne Mansion, where Mary discovers the true nature of Reverend Hawthorne's soul, his dark intentions, and his cryptic prophecy. Mary must make the ultimate decision and sacrifice, using her lineage's history as guidance and allies' support to expel Hawthorne's soul, break the curse, and save her town from impending doom. \\"The Expulsion\\" embodies a narrative of friendship, loyalty, self-discovery, and the courage to face one's destiny.

Question: What is the song that plays every morning? Movie plot title: Groundhog Day Movie plot: On February 1, self-centered and sour TV meteorologist Phil Connors (Bill Murray), news producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) from fictional Pittsburgh television station WPBH-TV9 travel to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities with Punxsutawney Phil, the Groundhog. Having grown tired of this assignment, Phil grudgingly gives his report during the festival and parade.After the celebration concludes, a blizzard develops that Connors had predicted would miss them, closing the roads and shutting down long-distance phone services, forcing the team to return to Punxsutawney. Connors awakens the next morning, however, to find it is February 2 again, and his day unfolds in almost exactly the same way. Connors can change his behavior, but other people do and say the same things they did and said the previous day, unless Connors changes something. He is aware of the repetition, but everyone else seems to be living February 2 for the first time. This recursion repeats the following morning and the one after that, and over and over again. For Connors, Groundhog Day begins each morning at 6:00 A.M., when he wakes up in his room in a Victorian bed and breakfast. His clock radio is always playing the same song, Sonny & Cher's \\"I Got You Babe.\\" His memories of the \\"previous\\" day are intact, but he's trapped in a seemingly endless time loop, repeating the same day in the same small town.After briefly trying to rationalize his situation, and then thinking he is insane, Connors takes advantage of learning the day's events and the information he is able to gather about the town's inhabitants, and finds that his actions have no long-term consequences for himself. He revels in this situation for a time: seducing beautiful women, stealing money, even driving drunk and experiencing a police chase. However, his attempts to seduce his producer, Rita, are met with repeated failures. He begins to tire of, and then dread, his existence, starting the day by smashing the...

The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful.  - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - Stephen Reeder Donaldson ( born May 13 , 1947 ) is an American fantasy , science fiction and mystery novelist , most famous for The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant , his ten - novel fantasy series . His work is characterized by psychological complexity , conceptual abstractness , moral bleakness , and the use of an arcane vocabulary , and has attracted critical praise for its \`\` imagination , vivid characterizations , and fast pace . '' He earned his bachelor 's degree from The College of Wooster and a Master 's degree from Kent State University . He currently resides in New Mexico . In the United Kingdom he is usually called \`\` Stephen Donaldson '' ( without the \`\` R '' ) .  - A bachelor's degree (from Middle Latin \\"baccalaureus\\") or baccalaureate (from Modern Latin \\"baccalaureatus\\") is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study lasting three to seven years (depending on institution and academic discipline). In some institutions and educational systems, some bachelor's degrees can only be taken as graduate or postgraduate degrees after a first degree has been completed. In countries with qualifications frameworks, bachelor's degrees are normally one of the major levels in the framework (sometimes two levels where non-honours and honours bachelor's degrees are considered separately), although some qualifications titled bachelor's degrees may be at other levels (e.g. MBBS) and some qualifications with non-bachelor's titles may be classified as bachelor's degrees (e.g. the Scottish MA and Canadian MD).  - Kent State University (KSU) is a public research university in Kent, Ohio, United States. The university also includes seven regional campuses in Northeast Ohio and additional facilities in the region and internationally. Regional campuses are located in Ashtabula, Burton, East Liverpool, Jackson Township, New Philadelphia, Salem, and Warren, Ohio, with additional facilities in Cleveland, Independence, and Twinsburg, Ohio, New York City, and Florence, Italy.  - Northeast Ohio refers to the northeastern region of the U.S. state of Ohio. The region contains six Metropolitan Statistical Areas: ClevelandElyria; Akron; CantonMassillon; YoungstownWarrenBoardman; Mansfield, and Sandusky, along with six Micropolitan Statistical Areas: Ashland, Ashtabula, New PhiladelphiaDover, Norwalk, Salem, and Wooster.

It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".  - High fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy, defined either by its setting in a fictional universe or by the epic stature of its characters, themes, and plot. The term \\"high fantasy\\" was coined by Lloyd Alexander in a 1971 essay, \\"High Fantasy and Heroic Romance\\".  - The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant is a series of ten high fantasy novels written by American author Stephen R. Donaldson. The series began as a trilogy, entitled \\"The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever\\".

A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Innovation can be defined simply as a \\"new idea, device, or method\\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \\"innovation\\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \\"breaks into\\" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation.  - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America.

These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology.  - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.  - Florence is the capital city of the Italian region of Tuscany and of the Metropolitan City of Florence. It is the most populous city in Tuscany, with 383,083 inhabitants, expanding to over 1,520,000 in the metropolitan area.  - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.  - An academic degree is a qualification awarded on successful completion of a course of study in higher education, normally at a college or university. These institutions commonly offer degrees at various levels, typically including bachelor's, masters and doctorates, often alongside other academic certificates, and professional degrees. The most common undergraduate degree is the bachelor's degree, although in some countries lower qualifications are titled degrees (e.g. associate degrees in the US or foundation degrees in the UK) while in others a higher-level first degree is more usual.  - Cleveland is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the county seat of Cuyahoga County, the most populous county in the state. The city is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie, approximately west of the Pennsylvania border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, and became a manufacturing center owing to its location on the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines. Cleveland's economy has diversified sectors that include manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, and biomedical. Cleveland is also home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.

The Magna Carta, a milestone document in Western democracy and human rights, continues to hold significant meaning in modern society. The issuing of these unique stamps reflects the profound impact of this historical event, allowing individuals around the world to join the celebration and remember the relevance of the Magna Carta today. The Magna Carta: A Brief History Signed in 1215 on the banks of the River Thames by King John of England, the Magna Carta sought to establish fair governance and limit the monarch's power. Initially an agreement between the king and angry barons, the document laid the foundation for the concept of justice and rule of law in a time when the king's rule was arbitrary. While many of the original clauses have since been revoked, the Magna Carta remains an icon of civil rights and democracy and is considered the cornerstone of modern constitutionalism. Celebrating with Commemorative Stamps In an attempt to commemorate this momentous occasion, postal authorities have teamed up with historical organizations to design and issue an exclusive set of stamps that mark the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta. These stamps not only serve as a showcase of the artwork and design of the time but also allow collectors and history enthusiasts alike to take part in a moment of shared historical significance. The Design and Elements of the Stamps The commemorative stamps are adorned with intricate designs that exude the historical weight of the Magna Carta. Each stamp in the set features a unique aspect of the document, capturing the essence of this long-standing symbol of justice and fairness. One stamp presents a replica of King John's royal seal, used to authenticate the original document. Another features an illustration of the barons, highlighting their pivotal role in the drafting and implementation of the Magna Carta. Yet another stamp showcases the critical quill pen and inkwell, symbolizing the essential tools used in creating this enduring historical relic. The stamps also delve into the Magna Carta's lasting effects, with one stamp portraying an image of the United States Constitution, emphasizing the document's influence on the formation of the U.S. democratic system. Finally, a stamp with an image of the iconic document itself serves to remind us of the humble beginnings of modern-day governance. The Meaning and Impact of the Commemorative Stamps The release of these commemorative stamps offers a unique way for individuals to participate in the celebration of the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta. They provide a tangible reminder of the longstanding impact this document has had on the principles and development of democracy in Western societies. Through the medium of stamps, this important milestone is made accessible to a broader audience, enabling us to honor the past while reflecting on our responsibility to uphold justice, fairness, and accountability in the present. Conclusion As the world celebrates the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta, the release of these commemorative stamps contributes to the understanding and appreciation of this vital historical monument. As we pay tribute to this groundbreaking document, we must remember its purpose in shaping the human rights and democratic values that we cherish today. With these stamps, we take part in a global celebration that encourages reflection on our collective history and motivates us to continue pursuing the ideals established by this iconic decree."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The squadron was primarily responsible for carrying out offensive missions against enemy targets, as well as providing air support to other units when necessary. It is essential to mention that it falls under the legacy of the Reserve Attack Squadron VA-873, which was an essential component of the reserve forces in the past. The squadron VA-873 was based at a station located near a bay called \\"San Francisco Bay.\\" San Francisco Bay is a large, shallow estuary along the northern California coast in the United States. It is an incredibly important geopolitical and economic region, serving as a strategic hub for both military and civilian purposes due to its location near the Pacific Ocean and to the bustling city of San Francisco. San Francisco Bay offers a natural deepwater harbor, serving as a critical base for naval and maritime operations. As a result, the U.S. Navy Reserve established a base at the bay to secure the presence of the military and to maintain operational readiness. The Naval Air Station Alameda (NAS Alameda) was once the primary base for VA-873, situated on the western shore of San Francisco Bay, east of San Francisco and just south of Oakland. NAS Alameda, originally commissioned in 1940, was a vital Naval Air Station throughout World War II, the Korean War, and the Cold War era. The main purpose of this military installation was to support Navy and Marine Corps aviation units, as well as to conduct anti-submarine warfare operations. In summary, VA-873 was a critical attack squadron of the U.S. Navy Reserve. It was based at a station near San Francisco Bay, specifically at the Naval Air Station Alameda. The bay and its strategic location provided invaluable support to the Navy and Marine Corps aviation operations. Furthermore, positioning the VA-873 squadron in this area allowed for swift and efficient response capabilities in times of need, thus ensuring the continued operational readiness of the U.S. Navy Reserve."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

I also didn't have any messages at  any of the 3 phones I can be reached through. Come Thursday afternoon, still  no interaction...I am pissed. About 2:00 p.m. he calls.

He informs me  that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard me corn) for Enron. While he is very excited about trading I get the impression he feels a little  overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how much trading will limit his  vacation time. He said that he and Darren (the guy he works with) had been  meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the week  had pretty much just been one long meeting. It is around this time that he  brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a trader you work  when the markets are open and you're only off when they're closed.

They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead!  Paragraph: Two students studied the atmosphere of Earth and other planets from our solar system.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student learned more about corrosive sulfuric acid? Answer:","output":"Ken, the student who learned about the atmospheric conditions on planet Venus, learned more about corrosive sulfuric acid.

Here, we can combine the terms containing 'w': -3w and -2w. -3w - 2w = -5w So the equation becomes: 0 = -5w - 25 Step 2: Isolate the term with 'w'. We want to isolate the term '-5w' to solve for 'w'. To do this, we will add 25 to both sides of the equation. 0 + 25 = -5w - 25 + 25 This simplifies to: 25 = -5w Step 3: Solve for 'w'. Finally, we need to find the value of 'w'. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -5. 25 / (-5) = -5w / (-5) This simplifies to: -5 = w So, w = -5 is the solution to the equation 0 = -3w - 2w - 25."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: Chemists look at the world in two ways, often simultaneously. The two worlds of the chemist are the macroscopic world and the microscopic world. Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain. Throughout your study of chemistry, you will often switch back and forth between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds.  and the situation: Two cousins went to college to get a B.S. Greg studied Biology, and his younger cousin Dawn decided to study chemistry. They both graduated Summa Cum Laudae.  Answer the following question: Which cousin studied less about the macroscopic world of chemistry? The answer to this question is:","output":"Greg, the cousin who studied Biology, studied less about the macroscopic world of chemistry.  While both Biology and Chemistry involve the study of matter and natural processes, they each place a different emphasis on the macroscopic and microscopic aspects of these processes. In their studies, both Greg and Dawn would have been exposed to both the macroscopic and microscopic worlds, but to varying extents. Biology primarily focuses on living organisms, their structures, functions, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution. Although biological studies incorporate a certain level of chemistry, the focus is generally more on the macroscopic aspects, such as entire organisms, organ systems, and ecology, rather than the microscopic aspects involving atoms and molecules. On the other hand, Chemistry is the science that deals with the composition, structure, and properties of substances (matter), the transformations they undergo (reactions), and the energy that is released or absorbed during these reactions. Chemists often study both macroscopic and microscopic aspects of matter, with a strong emphasis on the microscopic level. In chemistry, the macroscopic observations and measurements often serve as a basis to form hypotheses, create models, and explain phenomena at the atomic and molecular level. In her Chemistry studies, Dawn would have frequently switched between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds, using her knowledge of both to explain and understand chemical reactions, properties of substances, and chemical bonding. Greg, as a Biology major, would have spent more time studying the macroscopic aspects, focusing on larger scales such as organ systems and ecosystem interactions. Therefore, it is clear that Greg, the cousin who studied Biology, studied less about the macroscopic world of chemistry compared to Dawn, who pursued a degree in Chemistry."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Botany Systematic botany is part of systematic biology, which is concerned with the range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress. Q: How did Darwin change the grouping pioneered by Linnaeus?","output":"Imagine you have a big box of toys and you want to organize them. Linnaeus, a scientist long ago, started organizing living things (like plants) in groups based on how they looked. He put plants that looked similar together, just like you would put all your toy cars together in one box. Later, another scientist named Darwin discovered that living things change over time, and that these changes happen because they have common \\"parents\\" or ancestors. Think about how all your toy cars have wheels and can roll on the floor because they were made to do the same thing. Darwin changed how we group living things, like plants, by looking at their shared history or family tree instead of just how they look. This is like grouping your toys based on who made them or what they are used for, rather than just their color or shape. Now, scientists use Darwin's ideas to better understand how living things are related and share a common history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war.

Question: is gilley's in pasadena texas still open?","output":"No, the original Gilley's nightclub located in Pasadena, Texas is no longer in operation.  Gilley's was a renowned country and western nightclub that opened its doors in Pasadena, Texas in 1971. Its owners, country music star Mickey Gilley and his business partner Sherwood Cryer, transformed what was initially a simple bar into one of the country's most famous honky-tonk bars. The club was especially recognized for its large mechanical bull, El Toro, which was famously featured in the 1980 film \\"Urban Cowboy\\", starring John Travolta. Gilley's Pasadena club was not only the largest honky-tonk bar in the US but also held a significant place in popular culture. However, amid several business disagreements between the owners and a series of legal battles, the club was eventually closed in 1989. In 1990, the vacant building tragically burned to the ground under mysterious circumstances and was never rebuilt. On October 2, 2003, Gilley's was rebooted and reopened. However, this time it was not in Pasadena, Texas, but in a different location in the Cedars neighborhood of Dallas, Texas.

Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures.  What is an answer for this question: Which reaction will proceed slower? A:","output":"Reaction B will proceed slower because it has a lower temperature, which means the average kinetic energy of the particles is lower. This typically leads to a slower rate of chemical reactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Step 2: Analyzing the second question: \\"Why does everyone hate Hillary Clinton so much?\\" This question assumes that everyone has a strong dislike for Hillary Clinton and inquires about the cause of this intense hatred. Step 3: Comparing the two questions: Both questions are centered around the dislike for Hillary Clinton. However, the first question acknowledges that many people (but not all) have a negative opinion, while the second question assumes that everyone harbors such feelings. Additionally, the second question emphasizes the intensity of the hatred. Step 4: Determining if they are asking the same thing: Despite differences in their assumptions and levels of intensity, both questions can be interpreted as inquiries into the reasons behind the negative feelings directed towards Hillary Clinton. Conclusion: Yes, these two questions are essentially asking the same thing, even though there are slight differences in their phrasing and assumptions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Scene: A Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus On Mount Olympus, the elderly deities complain of feeling old and lament their waning influence on Earth.  Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery.  Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it.  Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance. Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis.  The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic.  Sparkeion flirts with his former fiancée, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis.  In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back.  Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter.  All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis.  Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods.  Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them.  They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth.  Thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods' absence.  Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter.

Please answer the following question: Article: A group of old classmates, who have succeeded in their work, got together to visit their old university professor. The conversation soon turned to complaining about the stress in work and life. Offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and many cups-china , plastic and glass, some plain  looking, some expensive and some lovely. The professor told them to help themselves to the coffee. When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said, \\"Can you notice all the nice looking expensive cups were taken, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones? While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source  of your problems and stress.\\" \\"What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you went for the best cups and were eyeing each other's cups.\\" \\"Now think about this: life is the coffee, and the jobs, money and position in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain life, and do not change the quality of life. Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cups, we fail to enjoy the coffee. So don't let the cups drive you, enjoy the coffee instead.\\" Question: What can we learn from the old professor's words? Yes or no, is the answer \\"We should concentrate on life itself but not other unimportant things\\"? A:","output":"From the old professor's words, we can learn a valuable lesson about focusing on what truly matters in life, rather than being preoccupied with superficial, materialistic things. The professor's analogy of coffee cups representing jobs, money, and social positions highlights the fact that these are merely tools to help contain and manage our lives, but they do not determine the quality and contentment of life. The coffee, symbolizing life itself, is what we should be cherishing and enjoying. So, yes, the answer is \\"We should concentrate on life itself but not other unimportant things.\\" By placing too much emphasis on the \\"cups,\\" we can lose sight of the importance of enjoying the \\"coffee\\" or the essence of life. It is essential to remember that while material success and achievements do play a role in our well-being, they should not define our self-worth or happiness. Instead, we should appreciate and focus on what truly enriches our lives, such as relationships, experiences, personal growth, and overall well-being. The professor's wisdom serves as a reminder that one's fulfillment in life does not solely depend on external factors, but rather on our attitude and perspective towards what is genuinely significant. By re-evaluating our priorities and emphasizing the more profound aspects of life, we can gain a greater sense of inner peace, happiness, and contentment. In conclusion, the old professor's analogy conveys a lesson about the importance of focusing on the essence of life, rather than allowing external, materialistic factors to dictate our happiness and well-being. By recognizing that the \\"cups\\" are only tools that help contain and manage our lives, we can shift our attention to what truly matters, enabling us to enjoy the \\"coffee\\" or the true richness life has to offer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Who wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\"?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Bush starred in the 1990 black comedy film Les Dogs, produced by The Comic Strip for BBC television. Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway. An edited version of this track was used as the B-side to her 1989 single \\"This Woman's Work\\". In 1988, the song \\"This Woman's Work\\" was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World. The song has since appeared on television shows, and in 2005 reached number-eight on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the Disney film Dinosaur, but the track was not included on the soundtrack. According to the winter 1999 issue of HomeGround, a Bush fanzine, it was scrapped when Disney asked her to rewrite the song and she refused. Also in 1999, Bush's song \\"The Sensual World\\" was featured prominently in Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan's film \\"Felicia's Journey\\".In 2007, Bush was asked to write a song for The Golden Compass soundtrack which made reference to the lead character, Lyra Belacqua.

The sentence appears to convey both appreciation and criticism, using opposing tones to create a balanced viewpoint. On one hand, the sentence reflects a positive sentiment through the use of the words \\"lovely\\" and \\"cuteness.\\" These words express appreciation for the object being described, suggesting that there are attractive, endearing, and even charming qualities about it. The word \\"trifle\\" also adds a sense of playfulness and lightness to the description, supporting the idea that the subject is enjoyable to some extent. On the other hand, the sentence also introduces a negative sentiment with the phrase \\"unfortunately, is a little too in love with its own cuteness.\\" This part signifies a form of criticism, as the author implies that an excessive focus on or obsession with being cute detracts from the overall appeal of the object in question. The use of \\"unfortunately\\" functions as a softening or disapproving modifier, further acknowledging that there is an issue or shortcoming with the subject being discussed. Overall, the sentiment of this sentence is perceived as a blend of positive and negative emotions, with a leaning towards a more critical or disappointed tone. The author acknowledges the enjoyable aspects of the subject but finds the overemphasis on cuteness to be problematic.

Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","output":"Ayam penyet is a popular and traditional dish originating from the Southeast Asian region, particularly in Malaysia. This culinary delight, which consists of flattened, deep-fried chicken, has gained significant prominence not only in Malaysia but also among food enthusiasts worldwide.  The term \\"ayam penyet\\" can be broken down into two words: \\"ayam\\" means chicken, while \\"penyet\\" essentially translates to \\"flattened\\" or \\"smashed.\\" The process of flattening the chicken is a crucial aspect of the dish, as it enhances the absorption of the diverse and aromatic spices, ultimately leading to a richer flavor profile. The flavorful marinade typically consists of a blend of spices and herbs such as garlic, shallots, turmeric, galangal, coriander, and lemongrass. The marinade penetrates the chicken, ensuring that each piece is equally infused with an array of piquant flavors. After being marinated, the chicken is then coated in a seasoned flour mixture, commonly made from rice flour and tapioca starch. This unique combination gives the chicken the desired golden-brown, crispy texture once it's deep-fried. As a traditional cooking method in Malaysian cuisine, deep-frying imparts depth and intensity to the chicken's flavors, creating an irresistible dish that diners can't resist. Complementing the vibrant tastes of the dish, ayam penyet is typically served with a fiery sambal, a chili paste that raises its heat level to new heights. Sambal often includes ingredients such as red and green chilies, shrimp paste, garlic, vinegar, and sugar. The accompanying sambal elevates the ayam penyet experience, adding a tangy, savory dimension to contrast and bring out the best in the chicken's flavors. In Malaysia and other parts of the region, ayam penyet is often presented on a banana leaf or a woven plate called a tampah, with a side of warm rice and an assortment of fresh vegetables, such as cucumber and long beans. These accompaniments create a harmonious medley of textures and tastes on the plate, providing a wholesome and satisfying meal. Given the dish's cultural significance in Malaysia and its growing reputation outside the region, it is no wonder that ayam penyet has become a gastronomic symbol of unity. The delicious fusion of spices, the tender yet crispy chicken, and the combination of flavors make ayam penyet an all-time favorite among both locals and tourists alike. This quintessential Malaysian dish represents not only the regional flavors but also the vibrant and diverse culture of the nation's culinary heritage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translation: He collaborates with several United Nations organizations, most notably the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP), and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In this context, collaborating with UNICEF, the World Food Programme, and UNHCR means working together with these organizations to achieve common goals and objectives. These organizations are all part of the United Nations system, and they work together to address various global challenges, including poverty, hunger, health, and displacement. UNICEF, or the United Nations Children's Fund, is a United Nations agency that provides humanitarian assistance to children in need. This organization aims to ensure that all children, especially those in the most vulnerable situations, have access to healthcare, education, and protection. UNICEF focuses on a wide range of areas, including child survival, development, education, emergency response, and advocating for children's rights. The World Food Programme (WFP) is another essential organization within the United Nations system. As the world's largest humanitarian agency addressing hunger and promoting food security, WFP provides food assistance to millions of people worldwide, particularly in conflict-affected and disaster-stricken regions. The organization not only addresses immediate food needs but also works to improve long-term food security and resilience through capacity building, supporting smallholder farmers, and addressing the root causes of hunger. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is a global organization dedicated to protecting and assisting refugees, internally displaced persons, asylum seekers, and stateless individuals. UNHCR's primary objectives are to ensure the protection and well-being of these populations, and to promote lasting solutions to their situations, such as voluntary repatriation, local integration, or resettlement in third countries. Working in collaboration with governments, other UN agencies, and non-governmental organizations, UNHCR strives to develop and implement comprehensive, effective strategies that address displacement crises worldwide. When collaborating with these organizations, one may actively participate in joint projects, share resources and expertise, exchange information, and coordinate efforts on the ground. By working closely together and leveraging the unique expertise of each organization, these collaborations strengthen the global response to complex challenges such as extreme poverty, food insecurity, and forced displacement.

[+] His eyes need to be more active . [+] None of the above choices . The answer:","output":"His eye pain could be attributed to a combination of factors, rather than a single one among the options provided. Based on the context, potential causes for his eye pain include: 1. Not removing his contacts: Continuously wearing contact lenses without taking them out can lead to a buildup of protein deposits and other debris on the lenses. This can cause irritation, discomfort, and even infections in the eyes. It is essential to take out contact lenses as recommended by the lens manufacturer and eye care professional. This allows the eyes to breathe and helps maintain proper eye hygiene. 2. Lack of sleep: Insufficient sleep might not only make the individual feel tired but can also negatively affect their eyes. Sleep is essential for the overall health of the eyes, as it provides necessary rest and allows the eyes to repair and recover from daily strain. A lack of sleep can lead to eye fatigue, dryness, strain, and other forms of discomfort. 3. Dry eyes: Both not taking out contact lenses and not getting enough sleep can contribute to dry eyes. Dry eye syndrome occurs when there is an imbalance in the tear system and the eyes are not adequately lubricated. This can result in itching, burning, redness, and a feeling of grittiness in the eyes. It is essential to address the root cause of dry eyes and follow appropriate treatment recommendations given by an eye care professional. 4. Eye strain: Additionally, his eyes might be experiencing strain due to excessive exposure to digital devices, insufficient lighting while reading or working, or even improper vision correction through his contacts. Prolonged eye strain can result in discomfort and tiredness in the eyes, exacerbating the eye pain. Based on these factors, the most accurate answer to why he is experiencing eye pain is not limited to a single option listed above. Instead, it appears to be a combination of not removing his contact lenses, not getting enough sleep, dry eyes, and potential eye strain, which should be addressed through proper eye care and consultation with an eye care professional."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage —  which became an instant success.

Also, it's important to remember that vowels can be both lower case and upper case. Step by step process: 1. Initialize an empty string, we will append non-vowels to this string. 2. Iterate over the given string, character by character. 3. Check if the character is a vowel or not. In both lower case and upper case. (vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U') 4.

US stock futures pointed to a slightly lower open on Tuesday as investors take a step back after last week #39;s three-day rally, with shares of drug maker Merck  amp; Co. What is this text about?","output":"This text is about the United States (US) stock market, specifically the anticipation of a slightly lower open for stock futures on a particular Tuesday. The mentioned activity in the market comes after a three-day rally during the previous week. The text also highlights Merck & Co., a pharmaceutical company, possibly indicating that the company's shares could be of interest to investors in the context of the market's trending behavior. Stock futures refer to contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase a specific number of shares of the underlying stock at a predetermined price, typically for delivery at a future date. These futures provide an indication of where the market is expected to open, based on various factors, including the global market, economic data, and company news. In this case, investors are expecting a slightly lower open for stock futures, which insinuates the possibility of a slight decline in the market after a three-day rally. A three-day rally refers to continuous growth in the stock market for three consecutive days. In this case, the rally from the previous week could have driven up stock prices and made investors more cautious about entering the market at this point, prompting them to take a step back to assess the situation. This behavior is common in stock markets, as they can experience periods of fluctuation where investors are constantly analyzing trends to anticipate potential changes and determine if it is an appropriate time to buy or sell stocks. Lastly, the text mentions shares of the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. While it does not provide specific information, this could imply that the company's shares might be influenced by the anticipated lower opening of the US stock market.

However, in general, deepwater drilling typically refers to drilling activities at water depths between 1,000 and 7,500 feet (300 to 2,300 meters) or even beyond. Ultra-deepwater drilling can reach depths of 7,500 feet (2,300 meters) or more.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - \\"Help Me Make It Through The Night\\" is a country music ballad written and composed by Kris Kristofferson and released on his 1970 album \\"Kristofferson.\\"  - Kristoffer \\"Kris\\" Kristofferson (born June 22, 1936) is an American singer, songwriter, musician and actor. He wrote and recorded the songs \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\", \\"For the Good Times\\", \\"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\\" and \\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\\". Kristofferson composed his own songs and collaborated with Nashville songwriters such as Shel Silverstein. In 1985, Kristofferson joined fellow country artists Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash in forming the country music supergroup The Highwaymen. In 2004, Kristofferson was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. He is also known for his starring roles in \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\" and \\"A Star Is Born\\", the latter for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.  - The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music, replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with \\"smooth strings and choruses\\", \\"sophisticated background vocals\\" and \\"smooth tempos\\". It was an attempt \\"to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock 'n' roll.\\"  - Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album \\"Shotgun Willie\\" (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" (1975) and \\"Stardust\\" (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.  - Johnny Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932  September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor, and author. He was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.  - Shotgun Willie is a 1973 album by Willie Nelson. The recording marks a change of style for Nelson, who later stated that the album \\"cleared his throat\\". When Nelson refused to sign an early extension of his contract with RCA in 1972, the label decided not to release any further recordings. Nelson hired Neil Reshen as his manager, and while Reshen negotiated with RCA, Nelson moved to Austin, Texas, where the ongoing hippie music scene at the Armadillo World Headquarters renewed his musical style. In Nashville, Nelson met producer Jerry Wexler, vice president of Atlantic Records, who was interested in his music. Reshen solved the problems with RCA and signed Nelson with Atlantic Records as their first country music artist.  - \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" is a song written by Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster, originally performed by Roger Miller. Others performed the song later, including the Grateful Dead, Kristofferson himself, Kenny Rogers and The First Edition and most famously by Janis Joplin, whose posthumously released version topped the U.S. singles chart in 1971, making the song the second posthumously released No. 1 single in U.S. chart history after \\"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\\" by Otis Redding. \\"Billboard\\" ranked Joplin's version as the No. 11 song for 1971.  - Outlaw country is a subgenre of American country music, most popular during the 1970s and early-1980s, sometimes referred to as the outlaw movement or simply outlaw music. The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like honky tonk and rockabilly and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation and introspective lyrics. The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and popular structures of the Nashville sound developed by record producers like Chet Atkins.  - Sings Kristofferson is a studio album recorded by Willie Nelson in 1979 consisting of all covers of Kris Kristofferson songs . It reached # 5 on the US Country albums chart , # 42 on the US Pop albums charts , and was certified gold in Canada and platinum in the US . The cover is very simple , a single picture of Nelson 's face against a black background , with the song titles to the right of his face . The back cover is the same background with both Nelson and Kristofferson 's faces together .  - Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson. After the wide success of his recordings with Atlantic Records, coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager, Neil Reshen, Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records, a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the \\"Tale of the Red Headed Stranger\\", a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'record label'.

Washington (CNN) Jared Kushner met earlier this month with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team as part of the investigation into Russia's meddling in the election, according to two people familiar with the meeting.      Mueller's team specifically asked Kushner about former national security advisor Michael Flynn, who is under investigation by the special counsel, two sources said. Flynn was the dominant topic of the conversation, one of the sources said.      \\"Mr. Kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so,\\" Abbe Lowell, Kushner's lawyer, told CNN.      The conversation lasted less than 90 minutes, one person familiar with the meeting said, adding that Mueller's team asked Kushner to clear up some questions he was asked by lawmakers and details that emerged through media reports.

(Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has been questioned by special counsel Robert Mueller's team of investigators about former national security adviser Michael Flynn, a person familiar with the investigation confirmed to The Associated Press.      The person said Wednesday that the questioning of Kushner earlier this month took about 90 minutes or less and was aimed in part at establishing whether Kushner had any information on Flynn that might be exculpatory. The person said multiple White House witnesses have been asked about their knowledge of Flynn, who was forced to resign from his national security adviser job at the White House in February after officials concluded he had misled them about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.      The confirmation of Kushner's interview came as prosecutors working for Mueller postponed grand jury testimony related to Flynn's private business dealings.      The reason for the postponement was not immediately clear, but it comes one week after attorneys for Flynn alerted Trump's legal team that they could no longer share information about the case. That discussion between lawyers was widely seen as a possible indication that Flynn was moving to cooperate with Mueller's investigation or attempting to negotiate a deal for himself.      An attorney for Flynn, Robert Kelner, did not immediately respond to email and phone messages Wednesday afternoon. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined comment.      In a statement, Kushner's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said, \\"Mr. Kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so.\\"      The details of Kushner's questioning and the postponement of the grand jury testimony were confirmed by people familiar with Mueller's investigation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the ongoing investigation.      The grand testimony that had been scheduled for the coming days related to Flynn's firm, Flynn Intel Group, its work with a public relations firm and interactions with congressional staff, one of the people said.      Mueller and the FBI have been interested in hearing from employees at the public relations firm, SGR LLC, because of the firm's work with Flynn Intel Group. SGR LLC, which does business as Sphere Consulting, did public relations work on a film Flynn Intel Group was working on about Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen. The film was never completed.      Mueller was appointed by the Justice Department in May to oversee an investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The investigation, which produced its first criminal charges last month against three former Trump campaign officials, incorporated an earlier FBI inquiry into Flynn's lobbying and investigative research work on behalf of a Turkish businessman. Flynn's firm was paid 530,000 for the work.      Sphere employees have cooperated for months with Mueller's investigation, including by turning over documents requested by investigators and sitting for voluntary interviews.      An October 2016 meeting that was expected to be the subject of the grand jury testimony has been described as a bait-and-switch carried out on behalf of Flynn's firm.      As the AP reported in March , Flynn's business partner, Bijan Kian , invited a representative of the House Homeland Security Committee to Flynn Intel's offices in Alexandria, Virginia, to discuss secure communications products. But after discussing the products, the session quickly turned into a lobbying pitch that mirrored Turkish government talking points.      Kian and others involved were particularly interested in pushing for congressional hearings to investigate Gulen, whom the Turkish government has blamed for a botched coup and who has been living in exile in Pennsylvania. Gulen has denied any involvement.      Flynn Intel Group's requests for congressional hearings went nowhere.      Flynn disclosed some of the details of the meeting in a filing with the Justice Department earlier this year. According to that filing, an employee of Sphere consulting was present during the meeting.      CNN first reported the postponement.      ___      Follow Eric Tucker and Chad Day on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP and https://www.twitter.com/ChadSDay ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, has been interviewed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team as part of the ongoing investigation into Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Presbyterians distinguish themselves from other denominations by doctrine, institutional organization (or \\"church order\\") and worship; often using a \\"Book of Order\\" to regulate common practice and order. The origins of the Presbyterian churches are in Calvinism. Many branches of Presbyterianism are remnants of previous splits from larger groups. Some of the splits have been due to doctrinal controversy, while some have been caused by disagreement concerning the degree to which those ordained to church office should be required to agree with the Westminster Confession of Faith, which historically serves as an important confessional document – second only to the Bible, yet directing particularities in the standardization and translation of the Bible – in Presbyterian churches.\\"? Answer:","output":"Question:  1. What distinguishes Presbyterians from other denominations? 2. What is the 'Book of Order' that Presbyterians often use and what is its purpose? 3. What are the origins of the Presbyterian churches? 4. Can you explain why there have been splits within groups of Presbyterianism? 5. What is the role of the Westminster Confession of Faith in Presbyterianism and why has it caused disagreements? Justification: 1. The first question drills down on how Presbyterians differentiate themselves from other Christian denominations as mentioned in the start of the passage. 2. The second question is aimed at understanding specifics of the practices in the Presbyterian church - the importance and role of the 'Book of Order'. 3. The third question goes into the history/origin of Presbyterian churches, an information which is directly mentioned in the text. 4. The fourth question tries to understand the reasons behind the dissensions within the groups of Presbyterians, as mentioned in the passage. 5.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Supercritical Fluids If we place a sample of water in a sealed container at 25 °C, remove the air, and let the vaporization-condensation equilibrium establish itself, we are left with a mixture of liquid water and water vapor at a pressure of 0.03 atm. A distinct boundary between the more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly observed. As we increase the temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas curve in the phase diagram for water (Figure 10.31), and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of 374 °C, the vapor pressure has risen to 218 atm, and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the boundary between liquid and vapor phases. All of the water in the container is now present in a single phase whose physical properties are intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called a supercritical fluid, and the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point (Figure 10.35). Above its critical temperature, a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much pressure is applied. The pressure required to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature is called the critical pressure. The critical temperatures and critical pressures of some common substances are given in Table 10.3. Substance.

We have succeeded in tracking down the man who has become a global ­sensation after dressing like horror writer Stephen King’s character Pennywise from the movie It.      His odd antics have appeared on TV news as far afield as the US, Australia, India, Canada and Japan, since he first turned up in Northampton on Friday, September 13th.      Journalists from across Europe have tried to identify him and a US couple holidaying in the UK even went to the town hoping to meet him.      Like King’s homicidal creation, the clown has been spotted standing, motionless, clutching balloons; waving or staring at disconcerted passers-by.      The only thing he says is: “Beep beep”, Pennywise’s catchphrase.      Photos of the sinister figure at the National Lift Tower, posing on Elm Street, next to a town statue and in a lake have been posted on Facebook and attracted more than 180,000 likes from all over the world.      He often teases fans about where he will turn up next by posting clues hidden in riddles on his Facebook page.      He told a local paper anonymously: “I just want to amuse people. Most people enjoy being a bit freaked out, then they laugh about it afterwards.”      Some followers are entertained but those with coulrophobia – an abnormal fear of clowns – do not see the funny side and have begged him to stop.      Today we can exclusively reveal the clown is Northampton University ­student and budding film maker Alex Powell, 22.      (Image: Matt Sprake Photography)      Following a tip off, we snapped him and Elliot Simpson, also a wannabe movie maker, and Luke Ubanski, who runs the Spot Northampton’s Clown Facebook page, walking into a town flat in their normal clothes.      Later Powell emerged dressed in the clown suit, while flanked by the pair, who checked the coast was clear before taking photos of him in a deserted car park just yards away.      Previously Powell, who was linked to a YouTube clip of a short film featuring an almost identically dressed clown, had denied he was the character.      He wrote on his own Facebook page: “There’s been lots of rumours that I’m the Northampton Clown but I am NOT! But thanks for all the interest as it’s shot my views right up.”      And he added falsely: “And I don’t live in Northampton any more.”      Yesterday the sleepy-looking joker opened the door in his pyjamas and, at first, insisted: “I am not the clown”.      But when we showed him our photos he changed his tune.      He confessed: “OK, I am the clown but I’ve been trying to keep it as ­mysterious as possible. To be discreet so people didn’t find out.      “Your pictures are from the day I went to meet a little girl who only has six months to live.      “Her mum messaged me saying she really wants to meet you before she dies. I took a picture with her and gave her a clown teddy and stuff.      “On Facebook I’ve had over a thousand death threats. It was just a bit of fun at first and a lot of people seem to enjoy it but it gets a bit hard sometimes with the death threats.”      Powell, who grew up in Paignton, Torbay, claimed a man threatened to knife him at Sixfields, Northampton Town FC’s ground.      He said: “I swear he had a knife and told me he would stab me if there were not so many people around.”      Powell said the police were initially interested in his activities but were now protective and looked out for him.      He said the death threats would not put him off dressing as the clown but added: “I had a call last night from someone who knew my name and asked if I was the clown and said if they saw me they would run me over.”      A string of fake online profiles have emerged claiming to be the clown and a vigilante rival, called The Clown Catcher, has even launched a campaign to try to track him down.      Encouraged by his fame, Powell has started handing out branded Northampton Clown T-shirts and bags.      Fans have demanded that he donate all the proceeds from his merchandise to charity and he has insisted he would not keep any of the profits.      “I’m not doing this for money,” he posted on Facebook. “None of it will come to me.      “I know this will have upset a few of you. If I get anything out of this it is going towards travel and charity! See you all soon! Beep Beep!” ||||| Fans of the Northampton Clown have reacted angrily to the apparent ‘outing’ of his identity.      Several national newspapers and other online news sites have identified University of Northampton student Alex Powell as the man behind the mask.      With his identity now seemingly uncovered, it is unclear whether the Northampton Clown will carry on making appearances in the town.      The Chron learnt the identity of the Northampton Clown before running an exclusive interview with him - however, agreed not to reveal it to maintain the mystery of the character.      Many fans have criticised the national press for the stories about Mr Powell, saying it has put his safety at risk and ruined the mystery of the clown’s appearances.      A man with a knife is believed to have threatened to stab the Northampton Clown after he appeared at Sixfields.      Louise Rose, commenting on The Mirror story, said: “Hope you’re happy with yourselves, why can’t you just leave things alone.. In a world full of dome and gloom this was a little light hearted fun, but oh no you journalist just have to spoilt it.. Well done!”      Luke Wood wrote: “Way to go you bunch of killjoys, a bit of harmless and LEGAL fun again ruined by the media. What’s next, a kids only issue of the paper spilling the truth about Santa, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy?”      Matthew Buckley wrote: “It’s a shame.. now you’ve identified him the people who want to kill him are going to be able to find him a lot easier now. Bit silly, no?”      A comment on the Mail Online story about the unmasking read: “Miserable newspaper unmasking him. Why spoil something funny?”      However, on the Spot Northampton’s Clown Facebook page the clown has told his 185,000 followers his identity is “safe”.      The clown has also told people “not to believe everything they read in the papers”, leading to the suggestion Alex Powell may not be the Northampton Clown after all. |||||Summary:","output":"The Northampton Clown, a mysterious figure who dressed like the character Pennywise from Stephen King's movie \\"It,\\" gained global attention for his strange appearances in Northampton, England.

Betty in turn looks up to Ida, much to Beasleyâs dismay, and Ida promises to keep the insects under check. Later that night, she examines the new insect, which she fondly names âMickâ, and informs her friend Max of the creature. Meanwhile, âMickâ escapes from his tank and attacks Beasleyâs pet dog, consuming the animal. The next day, Ida asks Misty out. They go on a date, and Misty asks if they can watch a movie about âTexas Pixiesâ on Ida's DVD player, which Ida accepts. Misty is introduced to Betty and the apartment, though Ida keeps her away from the bedroom where all her insects are hidden. The two get closer until interrupted by Max. Ida returns to find Misty asleep on the couch. She returns with a pillow (that has Mick inside) to give to Misty. In gratitude for Ida allowing her to stay, Misty returns the favor by seducing Ida. Unknowingly, Mickâs proboscis nips Misty's ear, which Misty dismisses. The next morning, Ida awakens to find that Misty has discovered her secret bug stash and has a great interest in bugs. They spend more time together, although Misty becomes weak and begins displaying unusual tendencies. Misty later comes across the pillow with Mick in it, and discovers that she has strange urges to lie next to it; the insect invades her much-chewed and saliva-doused ear with its proboscis. Ida receives an almost apologetic letter from a mysterious source, which tells her that the insect could be dangerous. At home, she is pulled into a... My question: Who is Ida's former tutor?

They roll up some snow into a huge snowball and roll up some snow into a smaller snowball that is about half the size of the larger snowball. Some of the kids push the huge snowball and some of them push the smaller snowball. Which snowball will take longer to get up to a fast speed? (A) smaller snowball (B) huge snowball.  What is the most sensical answer between \\"smaller snowball\\" and  \\"huge snowball\\"? Answer:","output":"The most sensical answer is (B) huge snowball. Step 1: Understand the scenario and the objects involved In the given scenario, there are two snowballs, one huge and the other smaller. The huge snowball has a greater mass than the smaller snowball, as its size is greater. Step 2: Consider the force required to accelerate the objects A greater force would be required to accelerate the huge snowball (with a higher mass) as compared to the smaller snowball with less mass.  Step 3: Evaluate the effect of the force applied on the acceleration Both the snowballs are being pushed by kids, and the number of kids applying force on each snowball may be different, however, the force applied would still likely be directly proportional to the mass. Step 4: Analyze the time taken to reach fast speed As we know, the time taken to reach a certain speed is directly dependent on the force applied and the mass of an object. More force is required to set an object with a higher mass into motion, so the huge snowball would take more time to reach a fast speed as compared to the smaller snowball, assuming the speed is similar for both. Therefore, the \\"huge snowball\\" takes longer to get up to a fast speed, making answer (B) the most sensical choice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices:  - wishing well - piggy bank - eat cake - change purse - parking meter  The rationale to choose \\"wishing well\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"A. The question provides the following clues for the correct answer: 1. James is spending money every weekend. 2. His parents feel that he is wasting his money. 3. The activity still occurs. We need to find the choice that best fits these clues. Now, let's evaluate each choice: - \\"Wishing well\\": It involves spending money (coins), and many people might see this as wasting money since wishes might not come true. Since his parents allow him to do this every weekend, they might find it harmless or charming. - \\"Piggy bank\\": This choice doesn't work, as placing money in a piggy bank doesn't waste money but saves it. - \\"Eat cake\\": Eating cake every weekend would mean spending money, but this choice doesn't specify that James would spend money on cake every weekend. Also, eating cake doesn't involve putting a coin anywhere. - \\"Change purse\\": This option refers to a container where people keep their coins, but it doesn't necessarily imply that money is being wasted. - \\"Parking meter\\": This choice involves spending money, but it's not a waste if James needs to park his car. Also, the question states that the parents feel the money is wasted, which doesn't necessarily apply to parking meters. Based on the given clues and the analysis of each choice, the rationale for choosing \\"wishing well\\" as the answer is: A. It best fits the description of the activity James engages in every weekend: spending money (coins), which his parents think is a waste but still allow him to do. Additionally, the wishing well is a common place where people throw coins with the purpose of making wishes, which can be perceived as a waste of money since wishes might not come true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Travis W. Redfish is a beer-drinking, bar-brawling, fun-loving distributor of Shiner beer. He also helps his father, Corpus C. Redfish with the family salvage company, whose motto is \\"Everything will work if you let it!\\" B.B. Muldoon is his best friend and business partner. While B.B. and Travis are making deliveries in their Shiner beer truck, they notice an RV that has broken down on the side of the road. At first, they laugh at the thought of helping the stranded motorists, but then Travis sees wannabee groupie Lola Bouliabaise smile at him through the rear window of the RV. Travis slams on the brakes and decides to help, hoping to get a closer look at Lola. Lola is a big Alice Cooper fan and Travis has never heard of \\"her\\". Road manager Ace and his assistant George try to talk Travis into driving them to Austin for a show to be played by Hank Williams Jr., produced by music mogul Mohammed Johnson. He meets Bird Lockhart, a hippie and lifelong roadie in the music business. After repairing the RV, Lola talks Travis into coming along where he ends up becoming the \\"greatest roadie that ever lived\\" with his unusual techniques on fixing things. On the road, Travis gets into a bar fight with \\"Tiny\\" Thompson after Lola accidentally ruins his little sister's hair by dumping beer on it in an attempt to meet Roy Orbison. After head butting Tiny, Travis ends up with \\"Brain-Lock\\",  a condition he developed in the war, for which chugging a pitcher of beer is the only cure. Lola convinces him to drive them to Hollywood for another show. He drives like a maniac and ends up with B.B in hot pursuit and the police right behind them all.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which forest would see higher rates of chemical weathering, forest A or forest B?  David is an environmental scientist. Last summer he visited the tropical forest in Brazil. He labeled that part of his study as forest A. To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany. He labeled that part of his study as forest B. He found significant differences in these two types of forests.  Hint: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's break down the information given in the paragraph: 1. Forest A is a tropical forest in Brazil. 2. Forest B is a temperate forest in Germany. 3. Tropical forests receive more insolation and rainfall than any other environment on earth. 4. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Given these points, we can deduce that Forest A, the tropical forest in Brazil, would see higher rates of chemical weathering due to the elevated temperatures and larger amounts of water it receives."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Rania Al-Abdullah (Arabic: rny l\`bd llh, Raniya al-\`Abd Allah; born Rania Al-Yassin on 31 August 1970) is the queen consort of Jordan. Born in Kuwait to a Palestinian family, she later moved to Jordan for work, where she met the then prince Abdullah. Since marrying the now King of Jordan in 1993, she has become known for her advocacy work related to education, health, community empowerment, youth, cross-cultural dialogue and micro-finance. She is also an avid user of social media and she maintains pages on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter. In November 2000, in recognition of her commitment to the cause of children and youth, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) invited Queen Rania to join its Global Leadership Initiative. The Queen worked alongside other world leaders, including former South African President Nelson Mandela, in a global movement seeking to improve the welfare of children. In January 2007, Queen Rania was named UNICEF's first Eminent Advocate for Children. In August 2009, Queen Rania became Honorary Global Chair of the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative (UNGEI).  As a longtime supporter of the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), Queen Rania met with children and inspirational women in South Africa, both in the cities of Johannesburg and Soweto, in March 2009. Queen Rania and the women took turns reading a short story out of The Big Read to the children, in an effort to encourage literacy. One of the stories in the book, \\"Maha of the Mountains\\", was contributed by Queen Rania. In Soweto, she was the first to write her name in the back of the Big Read, before passing it on to everyone else to write their name.  During her April 2009 US trip, Queen Rania joined leading education advocates Congresswoman Nita Lowey and Counsellor to the Secretary of the Treasury Gene Sperling to launch \\"The Big Read\\" as part of Global Campaign for Education's global action week calling for quality basic education for all children. She was also hosted by first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, during that same trip.  On 20 August 2009, Queen Rania co-founded and led the launch of the \\"1GOAL: Education for All\\" campaign alongside Gary Lineker, and with the help of top international footballers at Wembley Stadium, London. Queen Rania is co-founder and global co-chair of the 1GOAL campaign to rally World Cup 2010 fans together during the world's biggest single sporting event and call on world leaders to give 75 million children out of school an education. On 6 October 2009, Queen Rania was joined by Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the UK, the President of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa, and other heads of state, for the Global Launch of 1GOAL, which took place across six locations worldwide. Queen Rania spoke of the need to turn this \\"tragedy into triumph\\" and called on political leaders to stand by their aid commitments.  In 2008, Queen Rania participated in YouTube's In My Name campaign. She appeared alongside The Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am in the video, \\"End Poverty - Be the Generation,\\" which urged world leaders to keep the promises they made in 2000 at the United Nations Millennium Summit.","output":"This text is about Queen Rania Al-Abdullah, the queen consort of Jordan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the 2nd river she looks at is twice as big as the first river she is studying, then Karly would expect to see more or less erosion caused by the 2nd river?    Paragraph :  The bigger the waves are and the more sediment they carry, the more erosion they cause. A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can infer that the size and sediment-carrying capacity of a river significantly impact the amount of erosion it causes. Given that the 2nd river Karly is studying is twice as big as the first river, we would expect it to have greater wave and water volume. The paragraph mentions that when the waves are bigger and carry more sediment, they cause more erosion. Therefore, if the 2nd river is twice as big as the first river, it is reasonable to assume that the 2nd river would have larger waves and a higher sediment-carrying capacity due to its size. As a result, the 2nd river would have the potential to erode more rock material compared to the first, smaller river.

Article: \\"A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically with a smart phone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website\\" is the definition of \\"selfie\\" in the Oxford English Dictionary. In fact, it wasn't even in the dictionary until August of last year. It earned its place there because people are now so obsessed with (......) selfies - we take them when we try on a new hat, play with our pets or when we meet a friend whom we haven't seen in a while. But is there any scientific explanation for this obsession? Well, you should probably ask James Kilner, a neuroscientist  at University College London. Through our lifetime we become experts at recognizing and interpreting other people's faces and facial expressions. In contrast, according to Kilner, we have a very poor understanding of our own faces since we have little experience of looking at them - we just feel them most of the time. This has been proved in previous studies, according to the BBC. Kilner found that most people chose the more attractive picture. This suggests that we tend to think of ourselves as better-looking than we actually are. To further test how we actually _ our own faces, Kilner carried out another study. He showed people different versions of their own portrait - the original, one that had been edited to look less attractive and one that was made more attractive - and asked them to pick the version which they thought looked most like them. They chose the more attractive version. But what does it say about selfies? Well, isn't that obvious? Selfies give us the power to create a photograph - by taking it from various angles, with different poses, using filters   and so on - that better matches our expectations with our actual faces. \\"You suddenly have control in a way that you don't have in non-virtual  interactions,\\" Kilner told the Canada-based CTV News. Selfies allow you \\"to keep taking pictures until you manage to take one you're happy with\\", he explained. Question: What is the passage mainly about? Yes or no, is the answer \\"How taking selfies influences people's daily lives.\\"? A:","output":"The passage is mainly about the scientific explanation for people's obsession with taking selfies and how it relates to our understanding and perception of our own faces.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel. The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide. The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas. These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States. It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets. Enron North America-Upstream Products Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production. The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities. In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu. Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system. ENA West Power Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002. With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators.

Right from the moment we walked in, the delightful ambiance, friendly staff, and mouthwatering menu made it an unforgettable evening. The restaurant's design is an impressive blend of modern sophistication and rustic charm, with tastefully exposed brick walls, soft lighting, and elegant table settings. The black-and-white photos of iconic landmarks adorning the walls added a touch of class. We chose a table near the open kitchen, from where we could enjoy the melodic sounds of clinking pots and pans and appetizing aromas wafting from the chefs at work. The waitress greeted us with a warm smile, promptly provided us with menus, and patiently answered our questions about the dishes. We appreciated her honest and thoughtful suggestions, which helped us make our selections. I opted for the seared scallops appetizer, followed by the slow-cooked lamb shank as my main course. My dining companion went for the garden-fresh tomato and mozzarella salad and the sumptuous pan-seared chicken breast. Our appetizers arrived in no time, beautifully presented and bursting with vibrant colors. The seared scallops were cooked to perfection, delicately caramelized on the outside, tender on the inside, and served atop a silky cauliflower purée that tied everything together harmoniously. My companion's salad featured heirloom tomatoes, locally-sourced mozzarella, fragrant basil, and a flavorful balsamic glaze. The main courses were equally exquisite, showcasing the chef's expert talent and passion for crafting phenomenal dishes. My lamb shank was fall-off-the-bone tender and accompanied by a velvety red wine reduction that elevated every bite. The accompanying garlic mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables were the perfect complements. My dining companion's chicken breast was juicy and succulent, pairing wonderfully with the bright lemon herb sauce and sautéed vegetables. For dessert, we shared the heavenly chocolate lava cake topped with a scoop of velvety vanilla ice cream. The decadent warm cake encased a molten chocolate center that flowed like a river of happiness when we sliced into it, a fantastic conclusion to our meal. I cannot recommend The Gourmet Bistro enough for its top-tier food, impeccable service, and inviting atmosphere. The staff, from the hostess to the chefs, genuinely cared for their customers' enjoyment and went above and beyond to create a memorable dining experience.

Write an article with the title: \\"Evictions Soar in Hot Market; Renters Suffer\\"","output":"Title: Evictions Soar in Hot Market; Renters Suffer Introduction In recent years, the housing market has experienced a significant surge in demand due to various factors such as low mortgage rates, job growth, and increased migration to urban areas. While this might have resulted in a boon for some homeowners and real estate investors, many renters are facing an increasingly precarious situation as they grapple with the unrelenting rise in rent costs, housing shortages, and the growing threat of eviction. This article examines the reasons behind the soaring evictions in the hot housing market and the devastating impact it has on affected renters. The Underlying Factors of Rising Evictions 1. A Hotter Housing Market The housing market's upward trajectory has significantly impacted rental prices, with demand for rental units outpacing supply in many metropolitan areas. This has led to a rise in rents, making it increasingly difficult for tenants to find affordable housing options. Landlords seeking to capitalize on the booming market may push out existing tenants to either upgrade their properties or accommodate tenants willing to pay higher rents. 2. Economic Imbalance While wages have experienced sluggish growth in recent years, the cost of living, including housing, has skyrocketed. The widening gap between income and expenditure has left many renters struggling to make ends meet. Consequently, they often find themselves unable to keep up with rising rents, putting them at risk of eviction. 3. The Impact of COVID-19 The ongoing pandemic has further exacerbated housing instability, with job losses and reduced work hours disproportionately affecting low-income households and renters. Moreover, with the expiration of pandemic-related eviction moratoriums, many tenants now face the risk of eviction with no financial safety net in place. Effects on Renters 1. Homelessness One of the most devastating consequences of evictions is homelessness. Without adequate financial resources or access to sustainable housing alternatives, those evicted often find themselves on the streets or in overcrowded shelters, which, especially during a pandemic, pose significant health risks. 2. Mental and Physical Health Evictions can trigger a myriad of mental and physical health issues for those affected. The stress of losing one's home and coping with the uncertainty of finding alternative shelter can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders. Furthermore, the precarious living conditions resulting from evictions, such as overcrowding or exposure to the elements, can exacerbate existing health problems or lead to new ones. 3. Impact on Children Evictions often have a harmful impact on children, as the resulting instability can disrupt their education, social support networks, and emotional development. In addition, children from evicted families are more likely to suffer from chronic health issues, malnutrition, and developmental delays. Possible Solutions 1. Affordable Housing Initiatives Governments and cities must prioritize the creation of affordable housing to alleviate the rental crisis. Increase funding for construction and renovation projects aimed at increasing the supply of affordable rental units can help stabilize rents and reduce eviction rates. 2. Rental Assistance Programs Expanding rental assistance programs for low-income families can make housing more accessible and prevent eviction. These programs can provide financial aid or subsidies for eligible renters, helping them keep up with rising rents and maintain a stable living situation. 3. Tenant Protection Laws Strengthening tenant protection laws can shield renters from unjust evictions and provide them with tools to exercise their rights. This involves enacting rent control measures, implementing a legal eviction process, and ensuring that tenants have access to legal representation. Conclusion As eviction rates soar in the hot housing market, it is crucial for governments and communities to address the root causes and mitigate the consequences for affected renters. By focusing on affordable housing initiatives, rental assistance programs, and tenant protection laws, society can begin to provide the support and security needed to prevent a worsening housing crisis. Ultimately, a collective effort is required to safeguard the well-being and dignity of the millions of renters facing the threat of eviction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The review provided is negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the novel, and criticizes it for several reasons. First, the reviewer states that the novel focuses solely on the hardships of being female, which they perceive as an \\"excuse to complain.\\" This implies that the reviewer believes the subject matter is not well-handled or engaging, and perhaps even trivializes the real-world challenges that women face. Second, the reviewer points out that the writing is \\"weak\\" and fails to capture the reader's interest. This critique speaks to the quality of the prose and storytelling, suggesting that the author is not successful in crafting a compelling narrative.

Summarize the following: Your foal will be more comfortable being weaned in an environment that it is familiar with. About 3 to 4 days before you wean your foal, move it and its mother into a large pen. Keep them in this pen as much as possible, only moving them inside to sleep if need be. It’s best to wean 2 or more foals at the same time, so the foals can keep each other company as they are weaned. Remove 1 mare from its foal at a time, waiting at least 1 day before removing the next mare. This will prevent your foals from panicking at the same time and stressing each other further. Once the foal has adjusted to the pen, lead its mother to a new pen or stable far away. Make sure that they cannot hear or see each other, otherwise, the foal will attempt to find its mother and may end up hurting itself. It may help to feed your foal with some hay or creep feed while you move its mother to a different pen. This will keep it distracted and may stop it from panicking as much once it realises it is being weaned. Each foal will respond to being weaned differently. Some may panic for only a few minutes, where others may take up to a day to calm down. Watch your foal to make sure it cannot escape from the pen or hurt itself on the fence. Feed it as you normally would and allow it to calm down naturally before introducing its companion to the pen. Check the edge of the fence for loose nails or anything else that could hurt your foal before weaning it. It will likely spend a lot of time near the edges of the pen trying to find its mother. Once the mother and foal have been separated from each other, it will take around 1 month for the mother to stop lactating and the foal to adjust to being on its own. Give both horses plenty of time to adjust to their new living style before reintroducing them. If you bring the mother and the foal back together before the foal has been properly weaned, you’ll just need to wean them again. Make sure the mother has stopped lactating and the foal has adjusted to being apart from its mother before reintroducing them. Summary:","output":"To ensure a smooth weaning process, familiarize the foal with a large pen alongside its mother 3-4 days before weaning. Ideally, wean two or more foals simultaneously for companionship. Remove one mare at a time, with at least a day's gap between removals to minimize stress. After the foal adjusts, move the mother to a distant pen, out of the foal's sight and hearing. Distract the foal with hay or creep feed during this process. Monitor the foal's reaction and ensure its safety in the pen. Introduce its companion once it calms down. Check the fence for hazards beforehand. Allow a month for the mother to stop lactating and the foal to adjust before reintroducing them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Went straight from a facility that deals with homeless children (492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York) to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport about 20 miles away. It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home. I don’t even know the names of those I’m relegated to living with.

Context: A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words! Question: What kind of animal is Patch?

Process:  - The flu virus has receptors, which are like viral Velcro, on the surface of the virus particle - The receptors will lock onto a target cell using these chemical receptors on the surface, which docks onto the cell surface - The receptors  then go into the cell - The receptors use it like a factory - The receptors take it over and make it produce thousands or in some cases millions of copies of new viruses - The copies come streaming out of the cell - The copies infect other cells to make more viruses, or they escape from the body and infect a new victim -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the person got a antibiotic shot happens, how will it affect MORE cells being damaged.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the process of virus infection. In the flu virus infection process, the virus uses its surface receptors to attach to target cells. It then enters the cell, takes control, and uses the cell to replicate itself. Newly produced viruses are released from the cell to infect more cells or to leave the body and infect new victims. Step 2: Consider the introduction of antibiotic shot. An antibiotic shot is given to the person with the flu virus. Antibiotics are medicines that are primarily used to treat bacterial infections, not viral infections like the flu. Step 3: Evaluate the direct effect of the antibiotic shot on the flu virus infection process. As antibiotics are specifically designed to target bacteria and not viruses, the antibiotic shot is unlikely to directly affect the flu virus receptors or the virus' ability to infect and replicate within the cells. Step 4: Consider any potential indirect effects of the antibiotic shot on the flu virus infection process. Although antibiotics do not directly target viruses, they can help in preventing or treating bacterial infections that might occur as a complication of the flu. By addressing these bacterial infections, the body's immune system can be more focused on fighting the flu virus. However, this effect would be an indirect impact on the flu virus process and not on the virus receptors or replication process itself. Step 5: Conclusion The perturbation hypothesis, considering the introduction of an antibiotic shot, does not seem to directly affect the process of flu virus infection, damage to the cells or replication of the virus. The antibiotic shot may have some indirect effects on the overall health of the infected person by addressing potential bacterial infections, but it will not directly impact the virus process itself."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase. During the course of the chase Dulcie and Jordan are rescued, and then Nolan loses control of the car, with both he and Cavanaugh being killed in the resulting crash.

Уклонение от уплаты налогов является распространенным проблемным вопросом, на который правительства следует сосредоточить внимание. Обычно это противодействие предполагает использование двух методов, в основе которых лежат проверки налоговых органов (аудиты) и введение строгих санкций. Проверки налоговых органов или аудиты представляют собой процесс, в рамках которого специалисты налоговых служб проводят анализ налоговых деклараций зарегистрированных физических и юридических лиц. Это позволяет определить, являются ли предоставленные данные точными и полными. В случае выявления ошибок или уклонения от уплаты налогов проверяющие могут предъявить уведомление о необходимости доплаты или исправления сведений. Сей же подход служит удерживающим фактором для предотвращения попыток прямого уклонения от уплаты налогов. Такая система предотвращает намеренное понижение налогооблагаемой базы, а также создает стимул для соблюдения законодательства и правил в области налогов. Строгие санкции за уклонение от уплаты налогов являются другим важным фактором. Помимо возможности получить сообщение о корректировке налоговых обязательств или доплате, налогоплательщики, которые сознательно уклоняются от уплаты налогов, могут столкнуться с серьезными финансовыми штрафами, а также уголовным преследованием. В зависимости от степени нарушения, это может привести к большим штрафам или даже к тюремному заключению.

He ran out of the back door, leaving behind shoes, socks and shirt as he went. He flew into the water, not realizing that as he swam toward the middle of the lake, an alligator   was getting close. The mother in the house was looking out of the window and saw the two as they got closer and closer together. In great fear, she ran toward the water, shouting to her son as loudly as she could. Hearing her voice, the little boy made a U--turn to swim to his mother. It was too late. Just as he reached her, the alligator reached him. The mother caught her little boy by the arms just as the alligator pulled his legs. That began an unbelievable tug-of-war   between _ . The alligator was much stronger than the mother, but the mother did her best not to let go. A farmer happened to drive by, heard their screams, rushed from his truck and helped them.

Here is a news article: Marquez has cooperated with FBI agents, who have been interviewing him in recent days, according to a law enforcement source speaking on the condition of anonymity. He purchased the weapons in 2011 or 2012, around the time Farook is believed to have begun considering carrying out a terrorist attack in the U.S., according to a federal government official who also spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing. ||||| San Bernardino, California (CNN) As federal authorities attempt to piece together the circumstances surrounding last week's terrorist attack in San Bernardino , their far-flung investigation has taken them as far away as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.      But they have also returned, again and again, to a much closer source of clues: The house next door to the boyhood home of killer Syed Rizwan Farook      Their efforts there are focused on a bespectacled former Walmart employee, Enrique Marquez, and his purchase of a pair of rifles used in the attack that claimed 14 lives      Marquez has acknowledged that he bought the two AR-15s for Farook several years ago.He's also told investigators about a 2012 attack plot that he says he and Farook conceived but did not carry out , U.S. officials told CNN.      Marquez told investigators that part of the reason the two abandoned their plans was that around that time, they were spooked by unrelated FBI arrests of four people charged with attempting to travel abroad to carry out jihad.      Investigators are still trying to corroborate information provided by Marquez and haven't verified details of the alleged plot. Officials caution that Marquez's claim of a 2012 attack could turn out to be false and an attempt to deflect his role in helping buy weapons that Farook later used in the San Bernardino shootings last week.      Marquez, 24, has not been charged with any crime and has told investigators he didn't know about the plans for the San Bernardino attack. Since the shootings, he has waived his Miranda rights, cooperated with investigators and provided information, according to the officials.      Marquez could not be reached for comment. No attorney has come forward.      Mother: He is a good person      Marquez's mother, Armida Chacon, told reporters outside her home Thursday she had no knowledge of her son's involvement in events leading up to the shooting. A sobbing Chacon said: \\"He was a good person. How would I know? I didn't know,\\" adding that she has not been interviewed by investigators.      \\"He was a good young man. Whatever I asked him to do he would do. He watched over his brothers. He helped me a lot. He was my right hand around the house,\\" she said after requesting that journalists turn off their cameras before she would speak.      \\"I want to be left in peace. When I am ready, I will sit down and talk to you. My life changed since Wednesday,\\" Chacon said. \\"My son is a good person. A good person. The rest, I don't know how it happened. I want to see him.\\"      Authorities initially said they did not believe Marquez had any involvement in the San Bernardino shooting plot carried out by Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik , law enforcement officials said. But his role is continuing to be evaluated as he cooperates with investigators and they assess his information, officials said.      FBI Assistant Director David Bowdich was tight-lipped when asked about his status in the investigation at a news conference earlier this week. \\"I'm not prepared to discuss Mr. Marquez at this point,\\" Bowdich said.      Related by marriage      According to county records, Marquez and Farook are related by marriage, and the address on his marriage license is the current address of Farook's father. Marquez was married last year with Farook's brother as a witness.      He converted to Islam several years ago and attended the same mosque as other members of the Farook family.      Marquez, who was a state licensed security guard until his license expired last year, checked himself into a mental health facility in the wake of the attacks, according to law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.      According to officials, Marquez told investigators that he and Farook were on the path to radicalization as early as 2011. That same year, Marquez bought the first of two rifles for Farook.      Marquez gave the rifles to Farook shortly after purchasing them but did not report the transfer of ownership, two law enforcement officials said Tuesday.      Such transactions could be a violation of California law, the officials said.      Home raided, job terminated      Heavily armed FBI agents descended on his home on Tomlinson Avenue in Riverside early Saturday to serve a search warrant, waking neighbors with a bullhorn announcement for the occupants to come to the door. Agents ultimately forced entry through the garage. They returned a day later for a consensual search to retrieve items not covered in the scope of the warrant, according to a law enforcement official.      Agents also visited the Walmart store in Corona where Marquez worked. A spokesman for the retailer said Marquez has worked for Walmart since May, but \\"the decision has been made to terminate him.\\"      A co-worker who asked not to be named said she was twice interviewed by FBI agents earlier this week. They asked about Marquez's personality and interests, the co-worker said.      In a brief interview with CNN, she said she told investigators she had no knowledge of Marquez using weapons or of having any link to the killers, whom she did not know. She did not associate with Marquez outside of work, she said.      Neighbors and car-work buddies      JUST WATCHED Where were San Bernardino suspects trained? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Where were San Bernardino suspects trained? 02:30      Neighbors of the Tomlinson Avenue homes where Marquez and Farook lived next door to one another recalled the two working on cars together but did not know whether their relationship extended beyond that shared interest.      One neighbor, who asked not to be named, said Marquez seemed like a nice young man. \\"He was a good guy,\\" the neighbor said.      Another neighbor, Freddy Escamilla, said he'd recently run into Marquez on the street and that he was typically subdued, nodding hello but not saying much.      \\"He never really talked to anyone,\\" Escamilla said, adding that he was \\"really introverted. Very introverted.\\"      Marquez converted to Islam and attended mosque sermons on and off for a couple years, said Azmi Hasan, who has served as facility manager of the Islamic Society of Corona-Norco since 2000.      Hasan said Marquez acted goofy, describing one instance when he saw him outside the mosque laughing out loud to himself. When approached by Hasan about what was so funny, Marquez said he wasn't laughing.      Hasan said Marquez attended sermons by himself but stopped coming about two years ago. He said he ran into Marquez, who he recalled as quiet and introverted, at a party and asked why he hadn't been coming to sermons more often.      When questioned about why he wasn't coming to sermons, Marquez would say he was busy, according to Hasan. At one point, Hasan said, Marquez responded that Islam was not working for him.      Hasan said Syed Rizwan Farook's sister and brother-in-law also attended the mosque but that he'd never seen Marquez in their company. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"This is a news article about a man named Enrique Marquez who bought two rifles used in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Florida Hurricanes pose a severe threat each year during the June 1 to November 30 hurricane season, particularly from August to October. Florida is the most hurricane-prone state, with subtropical or tropical water on a lengthy coastline. Of the category 4 or higher storms that have struck the United States, 83% have either hit Florida or Texas. From 1851 to 2006, Florida was struck by 114 hurricanes, 37 of them major—category 3 and above. It is rare for a hurricane season to pass without any impact in the state by at least a tropical storm.[citation needed] Q: How many storms hit Florida from 1851 to 2006","output":"From 1851 to 2006, Florida was hit by a total of 114 hurricanes. Out of these hurricanes, 37 were classified as major hurricanes, indicating that they were category 3 or above in terms of intensity.  Hurricanes, a type of violent storm known as tropical cyclones, form over tropical or subtropical waters and sustain wind speeds of 74 miles per hour or greater. Among the hurricanes that hit Florida, the ones categorized as major hurricanes are typically the most destructive because of their extreme winds, heavy rainfall, and potential to cause severe coastal and inland flooding. Major hurricanes, referring to Category 3 or above, have wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. For a hurricane to be categorized as such, it not only needs to display powerful winds but also deliver a significant storm surge and catastrophic damage. These major hurricanes have the potential to cause devastating effects to lives and infrastructure, including housing, transportation, and various industries, leading to major economic impacts. The data mentioned describes how vulnerably positioned Florida is regarding hurricanes. The state's extensive coastline and its geographical location make it a prime target for these storms. This risk is especially prevalent during the hurricane season, which traditionally runs from June 1 to November 30 each year. The period from August to October is considered the peak of this season due to the warmer waters, which hurricanes use as fuel, reaching their highest temperatures. This frequency underscores the necessity for a robust hurricane preparedness strategy in Florida. Such a plan includes continual monitoring of weather updates, enforcement of building codes that can withstand high hurricanes, evacuation plans, flood zone mapping, and supporting residents in setting up emergency kits and insurance coverage. The state also plays a crucial role in conducting and supporting research related to hurricane forecasting and monitoring, participating in various programs and partnerships with national and international weather organizations to improve the accuracy and timeliness of hurricane predictions. These efforts help the state prepare adequately for hurricanes and minimize damage to property and loss of lives.  Even with these measures in place, it is pivotal that residents take hurricanes warnings seriously and take all the necessary precautions to safeguard their lives and their properties. After all, preparedness often makes a crucial difference between recovery and catastrophe during extreme weather events like hurricanes."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: \\"Which happened first, the United States declared independence or the decisive defeat at Yorktown?\\"  Context: \\"During the 1760s and early 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent. This was summarised at the time by the slogan \\"No taxation without representation\\", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: When you arrive in your new home, make an effort to get to know your neighbors. You might feel strange, or awkward, but even if you don’t become lifelong friends, you will benefit from being on friendly terms. A simple smile and wave will be enough for most people.   Stop by your immediate neighbors’ homes to say a quick hello and introduce yourself or your family. You can ask questions about the neighborhood (such as trash pick-up days), and can answer a few questions about yourself and your family. If you feel comfortable, you can host a little party for your neighbors to get to know them, offering them a chance to meet you and get to know a little bit about you in a casual, relaxed setting. Building a group of friends often starts with one person. From there, they can introduce you to their social circle, and help you connect through mutual interests. Your neighbors are a great place to start building that network. If you are religious, getting involved in your local church is an excellent way to meet likeminded people. Choose a church or meeting to attend, or choose several and visit a new one each week. See where you fit in and feel comfortable. While some religions have strict rules about which church you can attend, most do not. Look around, visit different churches, and meet with different clergymen to find the right fit for you. Groups run the gamut, from Young Republicans to book clubs. Evaluate your interests and search for a local group of people who enjoy similar hobbies or interests.  Social groups often have chapters worldwide. If you are already a member of any type of group, meet with the group’s leader to see if there is a branch in your new community, or a similar organization you can join. Some apps are intended for this exact purpose. Meetup, iGon, Weave, and Majikal are just a few that offer groups, events, and local business opportunities. A word of caution, however: any time you meet strangers, be wary of divulging contact information, and always meet in a public place. Many towns have message boards and Facebook groups designed to keep people in touch with one another. Search to see if your town has a message board or Facebook group, and join in the conversation.  Some towns have Facebook groups specifically for selling or buying items, much like Craigslist. Although this might not seem like the ideal way to make friends, selling or searching for certain items could connect you to people in similar lifestyle situations, such as people with young children, or people who love to garden. Visit your city’s website for information about message boards. Many cities will have these groups posted directly to the city’s website. If you are working or going to school, you have a built-in network of people. While not every person you work or go to school with will be an instant connection, make yourself known and familiar around the office or school.  If your colleagues are grabbing dinner after work, or having a drink, tag along. This will allow you to socialize without the pressure of getting work done, and will provide a low-key means of getting to know your coworkers. Make use of after-school programs or extracurricular groups to meet more people in a setting they are familiar or comfortable with. If you're not currently in school, you can even consider taking a course at a community college or joining an intramural sports group to meet people with similar interests. If you need help, ask for it. If you need help moving, find a moving service. If cleaning out your new home is drastically outside of your comfort zone, find a cleaning service and utilize their skills. You can meet some wonderful people by simply inviting them to perform a service for you.  While this may not be a great way to make friends, it is a great way to get an idea of what types of people and activities you have in your new town. You can ask the people you’ve hired what they like to do for fun, where they like to eat, etc. Always treat people helping you with kindness. If they are providing a service, offer a tip. If they are helping for free (such as a neighbor helping you move in), give baked goods or a gift card in exchange.","output":"This article is about different ways you can make friends and build connections when you move to a new place.

First question: Why do I forget things that I read so easily? Second question: Why do I usually forget things that I have just read? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, let's address each question individually and then determine if they are asking the same thing.  First question: Why do I forget things that I read so easily? Forgetting things you read easily can be attributed to several factors. These factors can be categorized into three main areas: 1. Cognitive factors:    a. Limited attention: Our brain's ability to pay attention to a limited amount of information at a time can affect how well we retain information. If you're not focusing while reading, you're more likely to forget the material.    b. Encoding: Our brain encodes information based on its perceived importance and relevance. If the material is not deemed important, it may not be encoded effectively, leading to reduced retention.    c. Interference: New information can interfere with your memory of previously learned material. This can happen in two ways: proactive interference (when old information makes it difficult to remember new information) and retroactive interference (when new information makes it difficult to remember old information). 2. External factors:    a. Distractions: Your environment plays a major role in your ability to remember what you read. A noisy or disruptive environment can affect your focus and subsequent retention of material.    b. Lack of interest: If you have little interest in the topic you're reading about, it will be more challenging for you to retain that information. 3. Personal habits and techniques:    a. Lack of repetition: Research has shown that repeated exposure to information can actively improve memory retention. If you are only reading material once, it could explain why you easily forget it.    b. Absence of active learning strategies: Active learning strategies like summarizing, asking questions, or teaching the material to someone else can help improve retention. If you are not using these techniques, it might result in a higher likelihood of forgetting the material. Second question: Why do I usually forget things that I have just read? This question seems to be closely related to the first question, but it emphasizes the immediate lapse in memory after reading something. Reasons for forgetting things right after reading them can also be linked to the factors mentioned above. However, there is an additional factor that could shed light on this particular issue: 4. Short-term vs. Long-term Memory:   When you read, the information is first stored in your short-term memory. If you don't invest enough time and effort to move the information from short-term to long-term memory, it will rapidly disappear. This transition can be facilitated by using spaced repetition, elaboration, and engaging in active learning strategies. Now, to address if these two questions are asking the same thing: Overall, it can be said that both questions are similar and largely address the same concern, which is forgetting things that have been read. However, the second question focuses more on the immediacy of the memory loss after reading, while the first question refers to a general tendency to forget what is read. Both questions share common causes rooted in cognitive factors, external factors, and personal habits and techniques. The key difference between them is the emphasis on short-term memory in the second question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A council is to include the title 'Mx' on its official forms to be more accommodating to the trans-community. Campaigners say that 'Mx', short for 'Mixter', is a gender neutral alternative to Mr, Mrs, Ms and Miss. Brighton and Hove city council's trans-equality panel previously pointed out that the gender part of forms allows people to say if they are male, female or other. It said the lack of options in the title field does not provide for people who do not identify as male or female. Brighton and Hove city council is to offer 'Mx' as a title option on official forms following a review of services for trans people. Yesterday the council's policy and. resources committee approved a series of measures, including the removal of the need for patients to choose from male or female options when they check in at electronic screens on arrival at a GP surgery. Other recommendations include ensuring. all councillors and police staff undertake trans awareness training and. introducing gender neutral toilets and changing rooms, suggested by the council's trans-equality scrutiny panel. Brighton has a gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans population of about 40,000. The recommendations will now be passed on to the full council. Ruth Rose, 79, of Newhaven, Sussex, who was born male, said: 'It can be difficult in GP surgeries - I am not recognised. 'If I put in female I am not found if I put in male - which I am not - I am not found. 'You have to decide between one sex or the other depending on what stage of your transition you are at. 'And in some situations, for example, when you are getting your bins collected, does it matter if you are male or female?' The recommendation follows the suggestions from Brighton and Hove city council to introduce gender neutral toilets and send councillors and police to trans awareness training. The report noted: 'The Trans Equality Scrutiny Panel was ground-breaking, being the first in the country to carry out, in a sensitive and effective way, a detailed investigation into the experiences and needs of trans individuals and community in the city. 'It provides a firm and clear foundation for all public services to build on in terms of improving their understanding of and service provision to the trans community. 'For example, during the panel process housing officers committed to commissioning trans awareness training and city services committed looking at the introducing more flexibility on honorific titles (such as Mr, Ms) within online forms.' The clinical commissioning group made up of GPs across the county said it would implement the changes. Green Party councillor Phelim MacCafferty, chairman of the trans-equality and scrutiny panel which was set up in May 2012, said: 'Our transgender community is one of the most disadvantaged and marginalised groups in Brighton and Hove. 'There has been inadequate awareness of lives of trans people for too long. 'The recommendations of our cross party panel will make the city a fairer place for trans people to live, work, study or visit here.'

Trembling with cold and hunger crept she on, the picture of sorrow: poor little child! The snow-flakes fell on her long, fair hair, which curled in such pretty ringlets over her shoulders; but she thought not of her own beauty, or of the cold. Lights were glimmering through every window, and the savor of roast goose reached her from several houses;it was New Year's eve, and it was of this that she thought. In a corner formed by two houses, one of which projected beyond the other. She sat down, drawing her little feet close under her, but in vain, she could not warm them. She dared not go home, she had sold no matches, earned not a single penny, and perhaps her father would beat her,besides her home was almost as cold as the street,it was an attic; and although the larger of the many chinks in the roof were stopped up with straw and rags.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer you found does not accurately define a boutique bank. Let me provide a detailed explanation of what boutique banks are. A boutique bank, also known as a boutique investment bank or boutique advisory firm, is a small and specialized financial institution that offers a narrow range of services, primarily focusing on investment banking, mergers and acquisitions, and financial advisory services. These banks generally cater to specific industries or market segments and differentiate themselves by offering personalized services, deep industry knowledge, and a high level of expertise in their specific field. Unlike large, full-service investment banks, boutique banks usually have a smaller team of professionals who work closely with clients to provide more tailored and individualized solutions. The term \\"boutique\\" in this context highlights their specialized focus and smaller size compared to large, global financial institutions. Boutique banks often charge higher fees for their services due to their specialized knowledge and personalized approach, but clients may be willing to pay a premium for these specialized services. Many boutique firms can also compete with larger banks in terms of deal-making and advisory services by leveraging their expertise, nimble structure, and strong relationships within their respective industries or sectors. In summary, a boutique bank is a small, specialized financial institution that offers a limited range of services, mainly focused on investment banking, mergers and acquisitions, and financial advisory, targeting specific industries or market segments.

Which country declared war on Japan - the day before the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki ?","output":"The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 8, 1945, a day before the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. This declaration came at a critical moment in World War II as the conflict was nearing its end. During the Yalta Conference held in February 1945, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin had discussed their respective roles in the war's final stages. In those discussions, Stalin promised to join the war against Japan within three months after Germany's surrender, a commitment he upheld. Following Nazi Germany's defeat on May 8, 1945, the Soviet Union began shifting its resources and attention towards the Pacific front. Preparations were made to transfer large numbers of troops and equipment to the Far East in order to launch an offensive against Japanese-held territories in Manchuria, northern Korea, and other strategic locations. In the meantime, on July 26, 1945, the Allied forces issued the Potsdam Declaration, which called for Japan's unconditional surrender. The Japanese government declined to accept these terms, leading to the United States' decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. The Soviet Union saw the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima as an opportunity to act swiftly, lest Japan surrender before they claimed the territories they desired. Thus, on August 8, 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and launched a massive military offensive in the Far East, known as the Soviet–Japanese War or the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation. The Soviets quickly advanced through Japanese-held territory, capturing large areas of Manchuria and parts of northern Korea. The combination of the Soviet declaration of war and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki placed immense pressure on the Japanese government, ultimately leading to their unconditional surrender on August 15, 1945, and the formal signing of surrender documents on September 2, 1945. In conclusion, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan a day before the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, which played a significant role in shaping the final stages of World War II and the subsequent division of influence in the post-war world, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many clinics run a dog weight loss program where your pet is weighed and you can get specific instructions about how much to feed your dog. These regular weigh-ins, firm target, and moral support can make you more likely to succeed in putting your dog on an effective diet. Your vet may recommend one of the following diets:  High Fiber/Low-Fat Diet: These contain fiber which expand in your dog's stomach, making him feel full. The package instructions should clearly state how much to feed your dog based on a target (goal) weight. Metabolic diets: These are more high tech and feed the genes that improve your dog's metabolism. Increasing metabolism can make your dog burn more calories, causing him to lose weight. Pay attention to how much you're currently feeding your dog. If your dog is fed twice a day, weigh out the total amount so you know how much he's eating. However, if your dog has food constantly available, it's harder to determine how much he's eating. This makes it more difficult to know how much to cut down. If this is the case, look at the food package and see how much it advises feeding a dog at your dog's target rate. For most dogs, the package will advise a weight range. For example, 300 to 350 grams of food a day. You'd want to choose the lower amount of 300 grams. Once you've determined how much your dog needs to eat a day, reduce the amount by 5 to 10%. For example, if you are feeding 300g of kibble a day, 10% of this is 30g, so the new amount is 270g. Feed this reduced amount for one or two weeks and weigh your dog. Hopefully, he loses weight, but if he hasn't, deduct another 5 to 10% from his daily food amount. Weigh your dog again after feeding the reduced amount for another week or two. Don't be upset or worried if the portion size looks small or your dog pesters you for food. This is a normal concern when putting a dog on a diet. If you're really unsettled, you may want to feed a prescription weight loss diet instead. Since you'll be cutting back on your dog's food and increasing exercise, you'll need to offer positive encourage every so often. While you can praise your dog, you can also give him the rare treat. Just be sure to offer something healthy that will also make him feel full and satisfied. Some good options include:  Bran or grated vegetable mixed with his food French or runner beans, raw Apples (in moderation) Bananas (in moderation) Get your dog involved in earning his food, rather than just set it out in front of him. Buy a puzzle or activity feeder that you can fill with food. Your dog then moves shapes around or rolls balls around to get the food inside to fall out. This can make your dog more active and mentally engaged. Try to prevent boredom while your dog's on a diet. Keeping his mind occupied will prevent him from thinking about food. Training is also a great way to keep a dog active and prevent boredom. Of course training depends heavily on rewards, so take some of his dinner kibble and set it aside for rewards or give him lots of praising. Weigh your dog once every week or two so you can track any weight loss. This will also indicate whether your diet and routine are working. If he isn't losing, then you can reevaluate what you're doing. Make sure your goals are reasonable and that you're consistent with the regimen. Don't expect sudden drops in weight. Instead, look for slow and steady weight loss which is more sustainable. Smaller dogs should aim to lose no more than four ounces a week while larger dogs can aim for one pound per week. If you have a large dog or do not have access to scales, use a tape measure. Chose a point on the dog such as his girth or his waist and measure around it. Make a note of any landmarks the tape passes over, such as a particular pattern or spot, so you place the tape in the same place each time. Summary:","output":"Consult a veterinarian before starting your dog on a diet, as they can provide guidance on appropriate weight loss programs, feeding amounts, diet types, and offer moral support, while monitoring your dog's progress through regular weigh-ins and adjustments to ensure slow, steady, and healthy weight loss."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What part of the constitution are affirmative action programs based in? Context: Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

(H). russia. Answer:","output":"Answer: (G). middle latitudes.  Based on the hints provided by your teacher, we can conclude that the best answer to the question is 'middle latitudes'. Here's a detailed explanation: Unequal heating of Earth's surface by the Sun is a primary factor in the creation of global wind patterns. Due to Earth's spherical shape and the tilt of its axis, some parts of the planet receive more direct sunlight and are therefore warmer. In contrast, the poles receive less direct sunlight, causing them to be colder. Differences in temperature between the warm equator and the cold poles create pressure gradients that, in turn, drive the movement of air. This results in the development of global wind patterns, which are influenced by Earth's rotation and the unequal heating of its surface. Large cyclonic systems, also known as mid-latitude cyclones or extratropical cyclones, are weather systems that arise within the middle latitudes of the Earth (roughly between 30° and 60° latitude). These systems are responsible for many of the storms and severe weather events in the mid-latitude regions. In summary, the unequal heating of Earth's surface by the Sun causes large cyclonic systems to form in the middle latitudes, influencing the wind patterns observed within these regions. Therefore, the best answer to the question is 'middle latitudes' (G)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The story opens with Linet chasing something she believes to be an elf fairy.  Meanwhile, a Wolf tracks her.  Linet climbs a tree over a river and nearly falls.  She calls for help. but recovers and makes it back to land.  As she senses the Wolf watching her, she is discovered by a woodsman, Peter, who scolds her for being foolish.  As they walk back, Peter asks Linet why she can't stay home and be a good little girl.  Linet answers how good little girls hardly ever see the world (Lost in the Woods). When they arrive at the house, Lady Jean raises an eyebrow at Linet's disheveled condition.  Linet apologizes, but tells her mother how she came close to actually seeing an elf; and if she doesn't look, then she'll never know for sure.  As Lady Jean sends her inside to change, Peter comments to her how Linet is growing up and shows no fear.  They then talk about how when her husband, Lord Percival, was in the castle, there was no danger.  But since Percival's disappearance, his evil twin brother, Lord Godfrey, has taken over, and no one in the castle is safe, which is why Jean and Linet live in the country.  As Jean stands, she suddenly sees Godfrey approaching, and Peter leaves. Godfrey notes to Jean that today was the day her husband went off to war, and it has been seven years since, meaning that she is legally free to remarry.  He sternly implores that it is the right thing for Jean to marry him, but Jean flatly refuses and explains she still loves Percival.  Godfrey wonders, as Percival's exact twin, how Jean could not love him when it is clear she doesn't.  He offers her riches and beauty, by proposing to enable her to resume her role as lady of the castle, but she refuses. Godfrey loudly proclaims that, as far as he is concerned, she is the only candidate for lady of the castle, meaning that she WILL be his wife.

Asiana Airlines said Wednesday it no longer plans to sue a San Francisco TV station over the use of racially offensive names.      The South Korean air carrier said that KTVU-TV has already apologized for using fake names for four pilots on a plane that crashed in San Francisco on July 6. It will no longer sue, as it had said it would do.      Asiana says it wants to focus on supporting passengers and families. The crash killed three and injured dozens.      Last week, an anchor for KTVU-TV read the fake names _ apparently someone's idea of a prank to use fake Asian-style names that sounded out distress calls and curse words _ on air and then apologized after a break.      Asiana earlier said the report seriously damaged its reputation. It said Monday that it would sue the TV station to respond to the racially discriminatory report that disparaged Asians. ||||| Two passengers aboard the Asiana Airlines flight that crashed while landing in San Francisco have sued the carrier, claiming they suffered \\"extreme and catastrophic injuries and emotional distress\\" as a result of the accident.      The suit is believed to be the first following the July 6 crash. A lawyer for Asiana didn't respond to a request for comment.      Asiana flight 214 hit a sea wall in front of a runway at San Francisco International Airport and skidded to a stop before catching fire. Three passengers died and dozens more were injured.      In their initial probe, National Transportation Safety Board investigators didn't find evidence of equipment malfunctions, agency Chairman Deborah Hersman said last week. The agency was looking into whether the pilots had received adequate training, according to people familiar with the investigation.      Asiana officials have repeatedly said the pilots were both highly experienced and the airline's training programs meet all international and South Korean requirements.      The lawsuit was filed in San Francisco federal court by Younga Jun Machorro and her son, Benjamin Hyo-Ik Machorro. Also joining the suit was Hector Machorro, the husband of Younga and father of Benjamin, who wasn't aboard the flight. He claims losses stemming from his wife's injuries.      \\"The conduct of Asiana's flight crew was egregiously reckless and negligent,\\" said Michael Verna of Bowles & Verna LLP, the Walnut Creek, Calif., lawyers for the plaintiffs. \\"These pilots were unable to do the most basic task—land on a runway in the middle of a clear day with no wind.\\"      Mr. Verna said that both Ms. Machorro and her son were treated at San Francisco General Hospital after the crash. X-rays revealed no broken bones, said Mr. Verna, but both suffered injuries to their backs and were still undergoing treatment.      Under an international treaty, Asiana, of South Korea, is liable for up to 150,000 in damages per injured passenger—damages that likely would be paid by the airline's insurers, legal experts said. Passengers might recover more if they can show the airline was at fault for the crash, as the Machorros allege.      The crash \\"occurred due to the gross negligence and recklessness of the Asiana flight crew on Flight 214,\\" reads the complaint, \\"in woeful violation of numerous international and United States airline industry standards and established flight rules.\\"      The Montreal Convention allows victims of the crash to sue Asiana in U.S. courts if they are permanent U.S. residents, purchased tickets in the U.S. or were flying into the U.S. as a final destination. All three plaintiffs are U.S. citizens, according to the suit.      Litigation over air disasters typically takes months or longer to unfold. Often, lawsuits are consolidated and handled by a single federal judge, a process known as multidistrict litigation.      Ladd Sanger, an aviation lawyer and commercially rated pilot in Dallas, said this would likely happen to any suits related to the Asiana incident. \\"We're going to see a lot of these filed in the weeks to come,\\" he said. \\"This is probably the first of many.\\"      The crash has stoked a long-running debate over how aggressively plaintiff attorneys are permitted to seek out clients after an aviation tragedy.      Federal law mandates what is effectively a 45-day moratorium, during which lawyers are barred from directly soliciting to represent commercial air-crash victims or their families. The restrictions often aren't enforced effectively, and veteran lawyers are replete with stories about how the rules have been skirted.      But in the case of the Asiana crash, federal accident investigators and local law-enforcement appear to have tried particularly hard to make lawyers toe the line.      James Kreindler, a veteran aviation litigator with the New York law firm Kreindler and Kreindler LLP, said he has never experienced such a show of force by local police to keep certain lawyers from entering the hotel where many family members were staying after the Asiana crash.      \\"I've never seen such tight controls,\\" he said. \\"You couldn't get through the front door unless you had a prearranged meeting with a specific hotel guest.\\"      Mr. Kreindler said he supports such restrictions because it prevents lawyers from trying to land clients with unfounded or exaggerated promises.      The NTSB also stepped up its game. Several days after the crash, the agency's general counsel's office sent out a mass email to members of the San Francisco Bar Association about the 45-day rule.      \\"We are closely following the activities of attorneys,\\" the message said, \\"and will immediately notify state bar ethics officials and other appropriate authorities if impermissible activity is suspected.\\"      A spokeswoman for the NTSB said \\"it is typical for local law enforcement to secure the family center,\\" or hotel where family members are housed.      —Joe Palazzolo and Jon Ostrower contributed to this article.      Write to Ashby Jones at ashby.jones@wsj.com      A version of this article appeared July 18, 2013, on page A5 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Asiana Jet Passengers File Suit. ||||| South Korea's transport ministry said Thursday it asked Asiana Airlines Inc. to review safety measures two months before an Asiana flight crash-landed in San Francisco.      Kwon Yong Bok, director general of aviation safety policy at the transport ministry, said the government informed Asiana on April 30 it should hire more pilots, engineers and cabin crew as the airline planned to increase its fleet of airplanes by 20 percent by 2017. It currently has 80 planes.      \\"We asked the company to review its safety policies once again,\\" Kwon said by phone.      He said the ministry also recommended that Asiana centralize its safety management system and set up an oversight team for aircraft maintenance.      The recommendations were made as part of a safety consulting program that the ministry set up for the airline industry to minimize the risk of accidents.      Asiana Flight 214 crash-landed at San Francisco's international airport on July 6, killing three people and injuring dozens. Twelve people are still hospitalized including five cabin crew, South Korea's transport ministry said Monday.      The crash of the Boeing 777 was Asiana's first accident since a cargo plane landed in waters near South Korea's Jeju island in 2011, killing two pilots. Its deadliest plane accident was in 1993 when a domestic flight crashed south of Seoul, killing 66 people.      The cause of the San Francisco accident is still being probed but investigators have so far found no evidence of mechanical problems with the plane. ||||| A Chicago law firm has taken steps to sue Boeing Co. on behalf of 83 people who were aboard the Asiana Airlines flight that crash-landed in San Francisco earlier this month, alleging that a malfunction of the plane's autothrottle may have caused the crash.      Ribbeck Law Chartered on Monday filed a petition for discovery, which is meant to preserve evidence, in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, where the aircraft manufacturer is headquartered. The firm said in a news release that additional pleadings will be filed against Asiana Airlines and several component parts manufacturers in coming days.      In addition to potential problems with the Boeing 777's auto throttle, some emergency slides reportedly opened inside the plane, injuring passengers and blocking their exit, and some passengers had to be cut out of their seatbelts with a knife, the firm contends.      Three Chinese teenage girls were killed when the airplane, carrying 307 passengers and crew on a flight from South Korea to San Francisco International Airport on July 6, approached the runway too low and slow. The plane clipped a seawall at the end of a runway, tearing off the tail and sending the plane spinning down the runway. The impact caused the plane to catch fire.      \\"We must find the causes of the crash and demand that the problems with the airline and the aircraft are immediately resolved to avoid future tragedies,\\" attorney Monica R. Kelly, head of Ribbeck's aviation department, said in a written statement.      Boeing spokesman John Dern said the company had no comment.      The petition asks a judge to order Boeing to identify the designer and manufacturer of the airplane's autothrottle and its emergency evacuation slides. It also seeks information on the systems that indicate the airplane's glide slope and that warn how close it is to the ground. Kelly said the firm wants to protect the wreckage \\"from destructive testing\\" and to obtain maintenance records, internal memos and other evidence.      A passenger filed a lawsuit against Asiana in San Francisco federal court on Monday, saying the airline showed \\"wanton and willful disregard for the rights and safety of all passengers,\\" the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Younga Jun Machorro and her 8-year-old son, Benjamin Machorro, were seated toward the front of the plane and both suffered back and neck injuries, their lawyer, Michael Verna, told the newspaper.      The pilots of Asiana Flight 214 have told investigators they were relying on automated cockpit equipment to control their speed. Inspectors found that the autothrottle had been \\"armed,\\" or made ready for activation, but investigators are still determining whether it had been engaged, the National Transportation Safety Board has said.      Two of the plane's eight slides malfunctioned, opening inside the cabin and pinning two flight attendants underneath. ||||| The wreckage of Asiana Flight 214, which crashed on Saturday, July 6, 2013, seen at San Francisco International Airport, in San Francisco, Friday, July 12, 2013.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? well , i 'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop","output":"Analyzing the sentiment of a sentence can depend on various factors such as context, specific words, phrases, or even punctuation used. However, based on the sentence provided \\"Well, I'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop\\", the sentiment appears to be negative. One of the crucial elements in determining this is the phrase \\"has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop\\". This phrase suggests that whatever is being referred to lacks significance or impact; comparing it to the \\"dramatic weight of a raindrop\\" insinuates it's light, minimal, or inconsequential. Typically, such weightlessness or minimal impact is not regarded as a positive aspect, especially when referring to things needing substantial weight or impact (like a dramatic performance, a statement, an argument, a discovery, etc.). Hence, this shows a clear expression of dissatisfaction, disappointment, or criticism, which inherently are negative sentiments. Additionally, the first part of the sentence \\"Well, I'm not exactly sure what–\\" creates an undercurrent of uncertainty or confusion, which is another indicator of negativity. Although not directly negative, this uncertainty in context juxtaposes the subsequent part of the sentence, reinforcing the negative sentiment. The use of the filler word \\"well\\" is also typically employed to express hesitation, another marker towards a negative sentiment. However, it's important to note that sentiment analysis is not always an exact science and can vary based on additional context, dialect, or personal interpretation. Also, the negativity here is mild and not intense, provided the language used is more suggestive and metaphorical rather than overtly critical. Still, the general lean would be towards a negative sentiment based on these considerations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Even the best comedians need to spend some time preparing what they are going to say.   Create a set list for yourself. Make a list of each joke you will tell. Think about transitions. How does one joke flow into the next? Is there some kind of logical progression? Keep in mind what kind of people you expect to see in the audience. Certain demographics will be more or less likely to enjoy certain types of jokes. An open mic at a church, for example, may not be the best place to try out very dirty material. Whether you’re the type of comic who follows a script or one who tends to free-style, rehearsal will always make your set better. Plus, it is the most effective way to stop yourself from laughing at your own jokes. Set aside time to run through your entire set 2-3 times before you take the stage.  The more times you rehearse your jokes, the more normalized they become, and the less likely you are to laugh. Be sure to time yourself. This way you’ll ensure that you have the right amount of material, and you can move through your set without concerning yourself with time. before taking the stage. Taking the stage cold sets you up for nervous laughter. Before you take the stage, find a way to warm yourself up, and release any “silly energy.”   Put on your favorite song and dance around making funny noises and goofy faces in the mirror.

All of these actions dispel nervous energy and prepare you to tell jokes on stage effectively, without bursting into laughter. If you do a good job of making the people around you laugh, you won’t need to laugh to fill the silence. Prevent yourself from laughing at your own jokes by making other people laugh.  Use vocal variation. Don’t fall into a monotone delivery. Signal the punchline. Pause for a moment to let the audience know it’s coming. Use a call-back. Reference something funny you said near the beginning of your set near the end. Audiences love this. If you really want to strengthen your comedy and prevent yourself from laughing at your own jokes, the only true remedy is spending as much time as you can telling jokes on stage. You can’t perform once a month (or less) and expect to improve at your craft. Try to make it out 1-3 times per week.  Begin by seeking out comedy open mics. You can find these advertised at coffee shops or bars, or in a local entertainment paper. Open mics are where you can practice, connect with other comics, and gain exposure. If you do well at open mics, you will be invited to perform at more regular gigs.

Cooper was born on May 7, 1901, in Helena, Montana to Alice (nee Brazier, 1873-1967) and Charles Henry Cooper (1865-1946). His father had emigrated from Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire and was a prominent lawyer, rancher, and (later) a Montana Supreme Court justice. His mother had emigrated from Gillingham, Kent and married Charles in Montana. In 1906, Charles purchased the 600-acre (240 ha) Seven-Bar-Nine cattle ranch about fifty miles (eighty kilometers) north of Helena near the town of Craig on the Missouri River. In early 1925, Cooper began his film career in silent pictures such as The Thundering Herd and Wild Horse Mesa with Jack Holt, Riders of the Purple Sage and The Lucky Horseshoe with Tom Mix, and The Trail Rider with Buck Jones. He worked for several Poverty Row studios, including Famous Players-Lasky and Fox Film Corporation. While his skilled horsemanship led to steady work in Westerns, Cooper found the stunt work--which sometimes injured horses and riders--\\"tough and cruel\\". Hoping to move beyond the risky stunt work and obtain acting roles, Cooper paid for a screen test and hired casting director Nan Collins to work as his agent. Knowing that other actors were using the name \\"Frank Cooper\\", Collins suggested he change his first name to \\"Gary\\" after her hometown of Gary, Indiana. Cooper immediately liked the name.  Cooper also found work in a variety of non-Western films, appearing, for example, as a masked Cossack in The Eagle (1925), as a Roman guard in Ben-Hur (1925), and as a flood survivor in The Johnstown Flood (1926). Gradually, he began to land credited roles that offered him more screen time, in films such as Tricks (1925), in which he played the film's antagonist, and the short film Lightnin' Wins (1926). As a featured player, he began to attract the attention of major film studios. On June 1, 1926, Cooper signed a contract with Samuel Goldwyn Productions for fifty dollars a week.  Cooper's first important film role was in The Winning of Barbara Worth (1926) with Ronald Colman and Vilma Banky, in which he plays a young engineer who helps a rival suitor save the woman he loves and her town from an impending dam disaster. Cooper's experience living among the Montana cowboys gave his performance an \\"instinctive authenticity\\", according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers. The film was a major success. Critics singled out Cooper as a \\"dynamic new personality\\" and future star. Goldwyn rushed to offer Cooper a long-term contract, but he held out for a better deal--finally signing a five-year contract with Jesse L. Lasky at Paramount Pictures for 175 a week. In 1927, with help from Clara Bow, Cooper landed high-profile roles in Children of Divorce and Wings, the latter being the first film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. That year, Cooper also appeared in his first starring roles in Arizona Bound and Nevada--both films directed by John Waters.  In 1928, Paramount paired Cooper with a youthful Fay Wray in The Legion of the Condemned and The First Kiss--advertising them as the studio's \\"glorious young lovers\\". Their on-screen chemistry failed to generate much excitement with audiences. With each new film, Cooper's acting skills improved and his popularity continued to grow, especially among female movie-goers. During this time, he was earning as much as 2,750 per film and receiving a thousand fan letters a week. Looking to exploit Cooper's growing audience appeal, the studio placed him opposite popular leading ladies such as Evelyn Brent in Beau Sabreur, Florence Vidor in Doomsday, and Esther Ralston in Half a Bride. That year, Cooper also made Lilac Time with Colleen Moore for First National Pictures, his first movie with synchronized music and sound effects. It became one of the most commercially successful films of 1928.","output":"This text is about Gary Cooper, an actor who began his film career in silent pictures and gradually gained prominence, attracting the attention of major film studios and earning starring roles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who is Norma Desmond's butler? Movie title: Sunset Boulevard Movie plot: At a Sunset Boulevard mansion, the body of Joe Gillis floats in the swimming pool. In a flashback, Joe relates the events leading to his death. Six months earlier, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe tries selling Paramount Pictures producer Sheldrake on a story he submitted. Script reader Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it in Joe's presence, unaware that he is the author. Later, while fleeing from repossession men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion. After concealing the car, he hears a woman calling him, apparently mistaking him for someone else. Ushered in by Max, her butler, Joe recognizes the woman as long-forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond. Learning he is a writer, she asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about Salome. She plans to play the role herself in a comeback. Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a script doctor. Moved into Norma's mansion at her insistence, Joe resents but gradually accepts his dependent situation. He sees that Norma refuses to face the fact that her fame has evaporated and learns the fan letters she still receives are secretly written by Max, who tells him Norma is subject to depression and has made suicide attempts. Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothes. At her New Year's Eve party, he discovers he is the only guest and realizes she has fallen in love with him.

The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. When can the National Guard be deployed to the border of US and Mexico? - after approval from Trump only - not enough information - before approval from the states - after approval from the states and Trump The answer is:","output":"- after approval from the states and Trump"},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a passage and a question regarding that passage.

Problem:Passage: In the China of the Yuan, or Mongol era, various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development, including the areas of painting, mathematics, calligraphy, poetry, and theater, with many great artists and writers being famous today. Due to the coming together of painting, poetry, and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals, though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others. Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy, the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together. In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan dynasty there were many famous painters. In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era. In Yuan poetry, the main development was the qu, which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets. Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time, and the other way around, with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu. One of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form. One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry, painting, and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art. Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current, vernacular Chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show. Another important consideration regarding Yuan dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in China, relatively to works from the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty, which have often been better preserved in places such as the Shōsōin, in Japan.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Magma is formed when rock melts inside the Earth&#x27;s crust - Magma rises - Collects inside magma chambers underneath a volcano - Pressure builds in the magma chambers as they fill - Gain energy for eruption - Some of the energy is converted into seismic activity (earthquakes) - If the magma building in the volcano is thick and sticky it will trap gases - Results in an explosive eruption when the pressure becomes too intense - If the magma is thin and runs - The magma results in a low-pressure, slow-moving flow of magma instead of a violent eruption -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the magma rises less happens, how will it affect the magma building in the volcano is thinner.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of magma rising less in the process can have both direct and indirect effects on the process. If the magma does not rise as much as usual, it can lead to a change in the type of magma built up in the volcano, resulting in thinner magma. The impact of this perturbation on the eruption process can be analyzed through various aspects. 1. Magma composition: The composition of magma plays a crucial role in determining its viscosity (thickness). If the perturbation causes the magma to rise inadequately inside the Earth's crust, it can potentially lead to a change in the magma's composition. A thinner and less viscous magma primarily consists of a higher percentage of basaltic components, which generally have a lower melting point and are runnier. 2. Magma chamber filling: As magma rises less in the perturbed scenario, the magma chambers underneath the volcano might fill up slower or not fill up completely. Consequently, this could result in either a delayed eruption or a lower intensity eruption as the pressure build-up might be insufficient to trigger a massive eruption. 3. Seismic activity and pressure release: With less magma rising, the associated seismic activity (earthquakes) might be reduced, indicating lesser energy conversion. It could also lead to a gradual release of pressure, which might prevent an explosive eruption. 4. Eruption style and intensity: Thinner magma has a lower gas content, making it less explosive. In the perturbed situation, where the magma is thinner, the likelihood of a violent, explosive eruption decreases, leading to a more effusive, slow-moving flow of lava. This change in eruption style and intensity directly results from the perturbation in the magma rising process. 5. Landscape formation: With thinner magma, the lava flows will be more fluid and runny, potentially altering the landscape formations created by the eruption. Slower-moving flows could lead to a more gentle topography, shaping the surrounding terrain differently from a more explosive eruption. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of magma rising less can have significant direct and indirect effects on the volcanic eruption process. These effects may vary depending on the specific volcano and its geological setting, but the overall consequence of the perturbation can result in a change in eruption style, intensity, and landscape formation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this: The six Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe, while nominally independent, were widely recognized in the international community as the Soviet satellite states. All had been occupied by the Soviet Red Army in 1945, had Soviet-style socialist states imposed upon them, and had very restricted freedom of action in either domestic or international affairs. Any moves towards real independence were suppressed by military force – in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Prague Spring in 1968. Gorbachev abandoned the oppressive and expensive Brezhnev Doctrine, which mandated intervention in the Warsaw Pact states, in favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of allies – jokingly termed the Sinatra Doctrine in a reference to the Frank Sinatra song \\"My Way\\". Other than being expensive what was wrong with the Brezhnev Doctrine? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The Brezhnev Doctrine, developed under Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, was a policy that justified the Soviet Union's intervention in the affairs of its Eastern European satellite states in order to prevent any deviation from Soviet-style socialism. While its primary issue, as you've mentioned, was the financial burden it imposed on the Soviet Union, there were several other problems with the doctrine: 1. Suppression of individual autonomy and sovereignty: By adhering to the Brezhnev Doctrine, the Soviet Union effectively undermined the sovereign rights of its Eastern European satellite countries. The doctrine gave the Soviet Union the authority to impose its will onto its satellite states, thereby stripping them of their ability to exercise their own autonomy in both domestic and international affairs. The use of force during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Prague Spring in 1968 demonstrated the extent to which the doctrine suppressed these nations' rights to self-determination. 2. Human rights violations: Due to the influence of the Brezhnev Doctrine, Eastern European countries were subjected to numerous human rights abuses. As the Soviet Union sought to quell any movements toward independence, it resorted to the use of force, political repression, and curtailing of civil liberties, resulting in many fatalities and the suffering of the general population. 3. Damage to the Soviet image and diplomatic relations: The doctrine not only aggravated tensions between the Soviet Union and the West but also eroded the Soviet Union's international reputation. The aggressive enforcement of the Brezhnev Doctrine fueled mistrust and opposition from other global powers, particularly the United States and its NATO allies, further exacerbating Cold War tensions. 4. Hindrance to internal reforms: The Brezhnev Doctrine promoted the maintenance of the status quo in the Soviet Union and its satellite states, making it difficult for these countries to introduce significant political, social, or economic reforms as they feared reprisals from the Soviet Union. In summary, while the financial burden of the Brezhnev Doctrine was a major issue, the policy also had several other negative consequences, including the suppression of the Eastern European countries' autonomy and sovereignty, human rights abuses, a damaged international image, and a hindrance to necessary internal reforms. By replacing the Brezhnev Doctrine with the Sinatra Doctrine, Gorbachev essentially gave these nations greater freedom to pursue their internal affairs without fear of Soviet intervention, ultimately pushing for more openness and reforms in the Eastern Bloc."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Mike is studying for his physics exam. He realizes that the best way to learn physics is to solve problems. To that end, he needs to to convert pressure of objects from one unit to another. In one problem, four scenarios are given for the same object, scenario A, scenario B, scenario C, and scenario D. In scenario A the pressure is given in Pascals. In scenario B the pressure is given in the atm. In scenario C the pressure is given in torr. Lastly, in scenario D the pressure is given in psi.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which scenario's unit would most likely be used in everyday world, scenario A or scenario D?  Hint: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units. The answer is:","output":"Scenario D To justify my answer, let's go step-by-step: 1.

Step 3: Modify the verb to correspond with the new instrument, making sure it is an action related to playing the instrument to maintain relevance. In this newly generated sentence, both sentences involve a person playing a musical instrument, which maintains some level of textual similarity (around 2 out of 5). However, the differences in gender, instrument, and the specific verb used create enough distinction for it not to be too similar to the original sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Amber Williams (Brooke Nevin), her friends Zoe (Torrey DeVitto) and Roger (Seth Packard) and her boyfriend Colby Patterson (David Paetkau) stage a prank at the town carnival, with Roger faking the return of the \\"Fisherman\\" killer, with the hook Roger says Ben Willis originally used. However, during the prank, their friend PJ Davis (Clay Taylor) performs a stunt as part of the act. The prank seemingly goes without a hitch, but when they return, they see everyone staring at PJ's body impaled on a pipe. The public believes the Fisherman to be behind it and to cover up what happened, Colby convinces his friends to burn the evidence and make a pact that the secret will die with them. One year passes after the group separates, and Amber returns to town to discover that Colby never left to pursue his scholarship. She leaves the party angry, and goes up to the mountains where she encounters one of the officers who witnessed the accident, Deputy Haffner (K.C. Clyde). Later that night, Amber awakens to a sound, and receives 50 text messages reading \\"I know what you did last summer\\". She drives to Zoe's shack to find her band rehearsing for a concert, and after Amber apologizes for not contacting her, Zoe allows her to sleep there for the night. The next day they find Roger fixing ski-lift gondolas; he angrily sends them away when they inform him someone knows what happened. Zoe goes to find Colby working as a lifeguard at a public pool; he dismisses her then returns to his post to find \\"I know what you did last summer\\" written in the ground. Amber is attacked on a ski-lift by someone wielding the hook, but Colby does not believe her.

The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1922 the British Empire held sway over about 458 million people, one-fifth of the world's population at the time, and covered more than 13,000,000 sq mi (33,670,000 km2), almost a quarter of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I'll start by apologizing to filmmakers everywhere for using the terms \\"filmmaker\\", \\"film\\", or \\"movie\\" in connection with this, but \\"criminal\\" and \\"crime against humanity\\" seem a bit harsh. The writing: pathetic. The directing: pathetic. The acting: pathetic. The cinematography: too inept for words. The technical skills used to assemble this atrocity: NONE WHATSOEVER. This lump of waste could hardly be called cinema. The majority of family home movies come closer to earning that distinction than Revenge Quest. No, this is just a 10 car pile-up caught on video. We'll skip the plot in this review, because there are far too many holes to be covered at once. Let's just say that it stinks worse than the rest of this movie. To call the acting one-dimensional would be giving them credit. What little there is, is atrocious to begin with, and made much worse by the terrible video and editing. The worst part of this atrocity, though, apart from the plot, would have to be the effects... or rather the disturbing lack thereof. There are no blanks in the guns, no flashpots, and what few sound effects existed were either stock \\"gun\\" sounds, or they were generated by mouth (yeah, you read that right). The filmmaker actually had the audacity to record a \\"shh\\" sound for the elevator doors; I guess he felt it made them sound more futuristic. This is supposed to be set in the year 2031, after all. That doesn't explain the sounds he created by mouth for the fist-fight scenes, however. If it wasn't bad enough that the sound quality is terrible (he just used the microphone that was mounted on the video camera, and it shows), the use of stock gun sounds was almost worse than not using any sounds at all. The sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a herd of sheep, and they're just as clumsy. Picture this: The bad guy enters an office building searching for his prey. A lady starts to run in fear. He raises his gun (an uzi), and shakes it. We hear a sound that is clearly not an uzi. The woman runs away from camera, and suddenly a single blood pack (only 1) explodes on her back (looked like she was hit by a paintball), and she falls flat on her face. Bear in mind that my description does far too much justice to the ineptitude of the actual sequence. In another sequence, one which almost- but not quite- makes the movie funny enough to watch, takes place in a stairwell. The bad guy chases the good guy and the lady he's protecting down the stairs, shaking his plastic uzi all the way. You may wish to duck; there are badly timed sound effects flying all over the place. I supposed Alan DeHerrera can't be locked away for conceiving of this train wreck, but he did follow through all the way to editing and releasing it. If there's any justice, there's bound to be some karma out there with his name on it. Should you decide to watch this lump of industrial waste- and I would strongly advise against it- be sure to watch for the entire scenes lifted nearly verbatim from Bladerunner, and the AM radio that doubles as a walkie-talkie.

Formed in 1997 in Houston, Texas, Destiny's Child members began their musical career as Girl's Tyme, formed in 1990, comprising Knowles, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett among others. After years of limited success, the quartet were signed in 1997 to Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment as Destiny's Child. Destiny's Child was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of their best-selling second album, The Writing's on the Wall (1999), which contained the number-one singles \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" and \\"Say My Name\\". Destiny's Child reunited for a farewell performance at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game on February 19, 2006 in Houston, Texas; however, Knowles commented, \\"It's the last album, but it's not the last show.\\" Their final televised performance was at the Fashion Rocks benefit concert in New York a few days later. On March 28, 2006, Destiny's Child was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the 2,035th recipient of the coveted recognition. At the 2006 BET Awards, Destiny's Child won Best Group, a category they also earned in 2005 and 2001.  After their formal disbandment, all members resumed their solo careers and have each experienced different levels of success. Since then, Knowles, Rowland and Williams have continued to collaborate on each other's solo projects through song features, music video appearances, and live performances. Both Rowland and Williams, along with Knowles' sister Solange, appeared in Knowles' music video for her single \\"Get Me Bodied\\" (2007). On June 26, 2007, the group made a mini-reunion at the 2007 BET Awards, where Knowles performed \\"Get Me Bodied\\" with Williams and Solange as her back-up dancers. After her performance, Knowles introduced Rowland who performed her single \\"Like This\\" (2007) with Eve. On the September 2, 2007 Los Angeles stop of The Beyonce Experience tour, Knowles sang a snippet of \\"Survivor\\" with Rowland and Williams, and the latter two rendered a \\"Happy Birthday\\" song to Knowles. The performance was featured in Knowles' tour DVD, The Beyonce Experience Live. In 2008, Knowles recorded a cover of Billy Joel's \\"Honesty\\" for Destiny's Child's compilation album Mathew Knowles & Music World Present Vol.1: Love Destiny, which was released only in Japan to celebrate the group's tenth anniversary.  Rowland made a cameo appearance in Knowles' music video for her single \\"Party\\" (2011), and the group's third compilation album, Playlist: The Very Best of Destiny's Child, was released in 2012 to mark the fifteenth anniversary since their formation. The fourth compilation album, Love Songs, was released on January 29, 2013, and included the newly recorded song \\"Nuclear\\", produced by Pharrell Williams. \\"Nuclear\\" marked the first original music from Destiny's Child in eight years. The following month, Rowland and Williams appeared as special guests for Knowles' Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, where they performed \\"Bootylicious\\", \\"Independent Women\\" and Knowles' own song \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\". A video album titled Destiny's Child Video Anthology was released in May 2013 and featured sixteen of the group's music videos. Knowles and Williams were then featured on Rowland's song \\"You Changed\\" from her fourth solo album Talk a Good Game (2013). Later that year, Rowland and Williams made cameo appearances in the music videos for Knowles' songs \\"Superpower\\" and \\"Grown Woman\\", which were both included on her self-titled fifth solo visual album. Williams released the single \\"Say Yes\\" in June 2014, featuring Knowles and Rowland. They performed \\"Say Yes\\" together during the 2015 Stellar Awards, and the live version of the song was mastered for iTunes in April 2015.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Since flash fiction is too short to get into the entire life of your character, you need to choose 1 moment to write about. Consider the theme you chose to write your piece around and chose an event related to it. It could be part of an everyday routine or something large that changes your character’s life. For example, if your theme is about loss, you may write your flash fiction piece about how someone’s daily routine changes the day after someone they loved passed away. Exposition and backstory take up a lot of words when you’re writing a flash fiction piece. Instead of explaining how your character got into a situation, start right when the event occurs. That way, you hook the reader to your story and don’t include boring or unnecessary information.  For example, you may write something like, “Jess walked out into the rain after midnight, thinking of ways she could win back all of the money she had lost at the poker table that night.” If you need to include exposition about your character, work it into their dialogue. The conflict is what causes tension and creates your story. Use your antagonist to challenge your main character so they have something to overcome. That way, your reader will feel satisfied as your character finishes their arc.  For example, if you were writing a story about a boxing match, you may have your antagonist wound your main character so it’s more challenging for your protagonist to win the fight. Don’t use multiple conflicts in a flash fiction piece since it can get confusing and wordy. Many flash fiction pieces end with a surprise ending that the reader doesn’t expect. Make the ending is a resolution to the conflict you told throughout your writing but done in a surprising way. That way, your readers will feel satisfied with the story and want to read it again.  Make sure the surprise fits with the rest of the story. For example, readers would be unsatisfied if a meteor fell out of the sky and stopped a monster from attacking. Do your best to avoid jokey twist endings since they’re overused. Summary:","output":"Writing flash fiction is about picking one moment or event in your character's life and building your short story around it. This could be about a happy or sad day, or a big life change. Instead of telling your reader lots of information about your character, you want to jump right into the action. This makes your story much more interesting! If your story is about a problem or conflict, it should be something that gives your main character a challenge, but not too many problems because that can be confusing. Flash fiction often ends with a surprise. The surprise should make sense with the story and make your readers happy and want to read your story again. Ending your story with a silly or overused twist might not make your readers happy, so it's best to avoid that."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Process: - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee.

Question: How did Jefferson avoid Virginia's possible provision of theology at UVA? Context: Jefferson's opponents said his position was the destruction and the governmental rejection of Christianity, but this was a caricature. In setting up the University of Virginia, Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own, though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity, arising from his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Some have argued that this arrangement was \\"fully compatible with Jefferson's views on the separation of church and state;\\" however, others point to Jefferson's support for a scheme in which students at the University would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation. Still other scholars, such as Mark David Hall, attempt to sidestep the whole issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history","output":"Jefferson avoided Virginia's possible provision of theology at the University of Virginia (UVA) by encouraging all separate sects to have their own preachers, despite the constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity.

The answer is:","output":"A suitable question for the passage: \\"Explain how LED technology is beneficial for supermarket freezer lighting and describe the challenges faced when using LEDs in such environments. Discuss the solutions that have been implemented to overcome these challenges.\\" The answer to this question could be: LED technology is advantageous for supermarket freezer lighting primarily because its efficacy is inversely proportional to operating temperature. This means that LEDs function more effectively in colder environments like freezers. Moreover, LEDs produce less waste heat compared to incandescent lamps, leading to savings on refrigeration costs for the supermarket. However, LEDs face certain challenges when used in freezer lighting. They are more susceptible to frost and snow buildup compared to incandescent lamps, which, if not addressed, can affect their performance. To tackle this issue, some LED lighting systems have been designed with an added heating circuit to help melt the frost and snow that accumulate on the LEDs.  Furthermore, research has led to the development of heat sink technologies, which play a crucial role in ensuring the optimal performance of LED lighting in freezers. These heat sink technologies transfer the heat produced within the junction of the LEDs to appropriate areas of the light fixture, preventing overheating and maintaining the efficiency of the LED lighting system. In conclusion, LED technology offers numerous benefits for supermarket freezer lighting. Despite the challenges faced, innovative solutions have been developed to make them a suitable option for efficient and cost-effective lighting in these temperature-controlled environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A new study of more than 260,000 people has found a link between sweetened soft-drinks and depression, and diet sodas may be making matters worse. Americans drink far more sodas than people in other countries-- as much as 170 liters per person per year.

Researchers followed their consumption of drinks like soda, tea coffee, and other soft drinks from 1995 to 1996 and then. 10 years later, asked them if they had been diagnosed with depression since the year 2000. More than 11,3000 of them had. Participants who drank more than four servings of sodas per day were 30 percent more likely to develop depression than participants who did not drink sodas at all. People who stuck with fruit punch , had a 38 percent higher risk than people who didn't drink sweetened drinks. And all that extra sugar isn't the actual problem.

Freedom from Want was published with an essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.Freedom From Want had previously been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies of the western world than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be \\"given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities\\", an echo of Karl Marx's \\"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\\".  In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase \\"The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world\\" describes an egalitarian America.  In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as \\"haunting and sharp\\" against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty.

However, some scholars have referred to the Vinaya Pitaka and the first four Nikayas of the Sutta Pitaka as the common core of all Buddhist traditions.[page needed] This could be considered misleading, as Mahāyāna considers these merely a preliminary, and not a core, teaching. The Tibetan Buddhists have not even translated most of the āgamas (though theoretically they recognize them) and they play no part in the religious life of either clergy or laity in China and Japan.

Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia. There being no suitable local school, Smetana was sent to...","output":"Bedřich"},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Does break mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"No, the word \\"break\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. In English, the word \\"break\\" can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In these sentences, \\"break\\" is used as a verb, but its meaning varies. In the first sentence, \\"I had to break a 100 bill just to buy the candy,\\" the word \\"break\\" refers to the act of changing a larger-denomination banknote (in this case, a 100 bill) into smaller units of currency (such as ten 10 bills or twenty 5 bills). This is usually done so that one can spend the money more easily for smaller purchases, like buying candy. In this context, \\"break\\" is used in the sense of exchanging or dividing money, and it carries a neutral connotation. In the second sentence, \\"Someone broke in while I was on vacation,\\" the word \\"break\\" is part of the phrasal verb \\"break in.\\" The phrase \\"break in\\" means to forcibly enter a place, usually for the purpose of committing a crime, such as burglary or vandalism. Here, \\"break\\" is associated with the act of gaining unauthorized entry, often by damaging or bypassing locks, doors, or windows. In this context, \\"break\\" carries a negative connotation, as it is linked with criminal activities and illicit behavior. In conclusion, the verb \\"break\\" demonstrates semantic versatility, as its meaning changes based on context and the words it is associated with. While the two sentences both use \\"break\\" as a verb, the meanings are distinct: the first sentence pertains to the exchange of money, and the second sentence concerns illegal entry into a property."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Zoran Milanovic, the candidate with the youngest age and shortest time party candidacy, has become the new general director of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the main opposition in Croatia. This sentence tells us about a person named Zoran Milanovic who has attained a significant position in Croatian politics. He is characterized as the youngest and having the shortest party candidacy, suggesting that he has achieved this position at a relatively early stage in his career. Moreover, his ascent to this position is even more notable because the SDP is the main opposition party in Croatia, implicating an active and perhaps challenging role in the national politics. Furthermore, becoming the general director of a major political party such as the SDP is a significant achievement. The position would require a broad knowledge of political affairs, strong leadership skills, diplomacy, and strategic decision-making abilities. Given the party's status as the main opposition, Milanovic's role would be pivotal in challenging government policies and providing alternative solutions for the betterment of the country. His role may involve uniting the party members towards a common goal, overseeing the party's operations, drawing up crucial strategies, and leading national and international negotiations. His young age and quick rise to such a high-profile role may symbolize a new generation of political leadership representing youth interests or indicate a fresh perspective in political strategies and operations.

The film is full of cockeyed angles, extreme close-ups, flashbacks and slow-motion, as DePalma tries to create the illusion that somewhere buried in all the busy detail of plot, something is actually at stake in Mission: Impossible. 4. Despite the snags, De Palma remains a virtuoso puppet-master, pulling the strings taut in a nail-biting robbery sequence, switching from micro to macro with Hitchcockian panache, and finally letting rip with a hell-for-leather climax. 5. Mission: Impossible helps remind us why the 1990s was such a powerhouse decade for great movies. 6. A sleek, whooshingly entertaining update of the vintage television series. 7.

The drama film The Journey is a fictional account of the true story of political enemies, Ian Paisley and which Irish republican? A:","output":"The drama film \\"The Journey\\" is a fictional account of the true story of political enemies Ian Paisley, a loyalist and unionist politician from Northern Ireland, and Martin McGuinness, an Irish republican and the leader of Sinn Féin, who were central figures in the Northern Ireland peace process. The film, directed by Nick Hamm and written by Colin Bateman, focuses on the relationship between these two sworn enemies during the peace negotiations in the mid-2000s. Ian Paisley, played by Timothy Spall, was the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), while Martin McGuinness, portrayed by Colm Meaney, was the chief negotiator of the republican party Sinn Féin. Both men were pivotal in the negotiations, primarily because of their deep-rooted commitment and influence on their respective communities. The fact that they were willing to put aside their differences and work together toward a shared goal of peace made the achievement of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement possible, ending decades of violence and resulting in a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. \\"The Journey\\" imagines a scenario where the two leaders take a car journey together, allowing for an exploration of the growing understanding and goodwill between them. This ultimately paves the way for a partnership that changes the course of history in Northern Ireland. The film is a blend of fact and fiction, using the real story of these political enemies as a backdrop for a gripping and thoughtful character study. In summary, \\"The Journey\\" is a fictional account of the true story of political enemies Ian Paisley, a loyalist and unionist politician from Northern Ireland, and Martin McGuinness, an Irish republican leader of Sinn Féin.

Here is a question about this article: The Western Chalukya Empire (Kannada:ಪಶ್ಚಿಮ ಚಾಲುಕ್ಯ ಸಾಮ್ರಾಜ್ಯ) ruled most of the western Deccan, South India, between the 10th and 12th centuries. Vast areas between the Narmada River in the north and Kaveri River in the south came under Chalukya control. During this period the other major ruling families of the Deccan, the Hoysalas, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri, the Kakatiya dynasty and the Southern Kalachuri, were subordinates of the Western Chalukyas and gained their independence only when the power of the Chalukya waned during the later half of the 12th century. The Western Chalukyas developed an architectural style known today as a transitional style, an architectural link between the style of the early Chalukya dynasty and that of the later Hoysala empire. Most of its monuments are in the districts bordering the Tungabhadra River in central Karnataka. Well known examples are the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi, the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti, the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali and the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi. This was an important period in the development of fine arts in Southern India, especially in literature as the Western Chalukya kings encouraged writers in the native language of Kannada, and Sanskrit like the philosopher and statesman Basava and the great mathematician Bhāskara II.

By far, this 24 Hour Fitness stays the least crowded at all times (I almost feel guilty about revealing this online for fear that it will get more crowded) compared to almost every other one I've been to (the only exception is the one in Indio, CA).  I have been to approximately ten different 24 Hour Fitness facilities over the past year.  The free weights are available in abundance AND THE PEOPLE THERE PUT THEM BACK WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GO!!!  Simply amazing!  They have two sets (4 each) of most of the dumbbells available in 5lb increments up to 150lbs (some clubs have them down to 2.5lb increments up to 52.5lbs).  They have two towers of bar bells available in 5lb increments and the heavier weights are available with the EZ Curl bar.  They have 3 flat bench press benches and (I believe) 1 decline and 2 incline benches.  The dumb bells and bar bells are the new style Iron Grip rubber coated weights.  Most of the equipment and facilities are new.  There are plenty of treadmills, stair machines and they have the new Precor elliptical stride machines -- I don't know the exact names for them...  I don't do any of the cardio classes, but it appears that there's always extra room in there.  The same thing goes for the spin classes.  I don't use the pool and I don't use the kiddie care facilities so I can't comment on those either.   My biggest complaint is about the locker room.  Many of the lockers look like they have been pried open at some point.  The showers are pretty crappy, but at least they have partitions (no doors).  Definitely not the worst showers I've used.

Two more hearts fall on the flop, so you have 9 outs.  9 x 4 = 36, giving you 36% chance to hit your flush and your opponent a 64% chance to hold up and win with a pair.  64/36 is a little less than 2 to 1.  Therefore, it would make sense to call bets slightly higher than half the pot size.  If another heart doesn't hit on the turn you are now 9 x 2 = 18% 18%/82% is a little worse than 5 to 1, meaning the bet has to be less than 20% of the pot. Summary:","output":"The passage explains the concept of calculating the odds of catching one of your outs in a poker game, using the example of aiming for a flush with two hearts in hand. To calculate the percentage, you multiply the number of outs (9 in this case) by 4, resulting in a 36% chance to hit the flush and a 64% chance for your opponent to win with a pair. The ratio of 64/36 is approximately 2 to 1, guiding the decision to call bets slightly higher than half the pot size. If the desired card doesn't show up on the turn, the odds change to 9 x 2 = 18% for hitting the flush and 82% for the opponent's win. The new ratio is roughly 5 to 1, suggesting that the called bet should be less than 20% of the pot in this situation."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The more curved the surface of a lens is, the more it refracts light.

Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The non-female role models on the protagonist, Scout, are primarily her father, Atticus Finch, and her older brother, Jem Finch.

Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Why did François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville contact Burke? Context: In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The two questions are not the same but are related. To clarify each concept, let's address them individually: 1. What is vegetation? Vegetation refers to the assemblage of plant species that grow and thrive in a specific geographic region or environment. It refers to all the plants and plant life forms that exist in a particular area, including trees, shrubs, grasses, and other flora. Vegetation serves various purposes both ecologically and environmentally, such as: - Providing habitat and food sources for animal species - Producing oxygen and sequestering carbon dioxide through the process of photosynthesis, thereby playing a critical role in maintaining the earth's atmosphere and mitigating climate change - Stabilizing soil and preventing erosion by maintaining soil structure through their network of roots - Purifying water through processes like transpiration and evapotranspiration, which help to reduce pollutants in the environment - Providing raw materials for human consumption and economic activities, such as agriculture, forestry, and landscaping Vegetation can be categorized into different types based on factors such as structure, species composition, climate, and ecosystems. Some examples of vegetation types include forests, grasslands, deserts, wetlands, and tundra. 2. What are vegetable cuttings? Vegetable cuttings refer to segments or parts of vegetable plants that are used for plant propagation. The process involves cutting a portion of a mature, healthy plant (such as a stem, leaf, or root) and encouraging it to take root and grow into a new, independent plant. This technique is commonly known as vegetative propagation or cloning. Vegetable cuttings can be an efficient and cost-effective way to produce new plants, particularly for species that are difficult to propagate through seeds. Some advantages of using vegetable cuttings for propagation include: - Achieving a faster growth rate compared to starting plants from seeds - Ensuring the new plants have the same genetic characteristics as the parent plant, which can help maintain a consistent quality and performance in agricultural production - Facilitating the production of plants that are hard to grow from seed, either due to low germination rates or complex germination requirements - Allowing for easier replication of plants with desirable traits, such as disease resistance, high yield, or specific flavors or colors In summary, vegetation refers to the plant life found within a specific area or ecosystem, while vegetable cuttings refer to plant segments used for vegetative propagation. The two questions are related in the sense that vegetative propagation is a method used for growing and managing vegetation, but they address different aspects of plant life."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Article: Many people consider their pets members of the family and are very sad when they die, but what if you could clone your dog, cat or bird?

He taught Ian how to trim excess fat and handle raw meat safely, ensuring that it was cooked to the appropriate temperature. Step 5: Cooking the dish After all the ingredients were prepared, it was time for Ian to learn the different cooking techniques. Matthew demonstrated how to sauté vegetables, sear meat, and deglaze the pan. Ian attentively observed and practiced these techniques under Matthew's supervision. Step 6: Seasoning and tasting Matthew emphasized the importance of seasoning the dish and adjusting flavors as needed. He explained how to use herbs and spices to enhance the dish's overall taste, as well as how to balance saltiness, sweetness, and acidity.

If \\"A male tennis player jumps in the air as he prepares to return the ball.\\", does this mean that \\"The tennis player is about to win the point.\\"?","output":"Based on the given information \\"A male tennis player jumps in the air as he prepares to return the ball\\", we cannot conclusively determine whether the tennis player is about to win the point or not. This scenario only provides a snapshot in time of a particular moment during a point in a tennis match without the necessary additional details to make a determination on the outcome of the point. In compelling detail, here's why the given scenario is inconclusive in determining if the tennis player is about to win the point: 1. Technique and skills: The male tennis player jumping in the air may have exceptional skills and technique that improve his chances of winning the point, but it is also possible that the opponent has an equally good skill set. Tennis matches are often unpredictable, and the players' techniques may vary during the game. 2. Trajectory and spin of the ball: The path and the spin of the incoming ball can also impact the likelihood of winning the point. If the ball is hit with a lot of spin or an awkward trajectory, the tennis player may be unable to return the ball effectively, or he may struggle to maintain control of his shot. 3. Court positioning: The tennis player's position on the court and his anticipation of the ball's trajectory may influence whether or not he returns the ball successfully. If the player is out of position or misjudges the ball's path, his chances of winning the point may decrease. 4. Opponent's preparedness: Another important factor to consider is the preparedness and reaction time of the opponent. Even if the tennis player returns the ball effectively, the opponent may be ready and able to counter with a strong shot, keeping the point in play. 5. Endurance and fatigue: The state of physical and mental endurance of both players can also play a pivotal role in determining who wins the point. It’s not unusual for professional tennis matches to last for hours, and energy levels can vary for each player. 6. External conditions: Weather conditions like wind and sun may impact both players' gameplay, making it harder to predict if the jumping tennis player is about to win the point. Playing surfaces, whether it be grass, clay, or hard courts, can also impact players' movement and ball response during rallies. Overall, the statement \\"A male tennis player jumps in the air as he prepares to return the ball\\" only provides a limited view of the situation without enough context to determine a direct link between the player's actions and the point's outcome. Factors like technique, court positioning, opponent's preparedness, ball trajectory, endurance, and environmental conditions all play a role in determining the winner of each point."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -68*l + 1560 = -72*l - 308*l for l.","output":"Alright, let's solve this step by step, like we're explaining to a five-year-old. 1. First, we have the equation:    -68*l + 1560 = -72*l - 308*l 2. Now, let's combine the terms with l on the right side of the equation:    -72*l - 308*l = -72*l - 308*l = -380*l 3. So, our equation becomes:    -68*l + 1560 = -380*l 4. Next, we want to move all the l terms to one side of the equation. We can add 380*l to both sides:    -68*l + 380*l + 1560 = -380*l + 380*l     (Remember, -68*l + 380*l = 312*l) 5. Our new equation is:    312*l + 1560 = 0 6. Now, let's get l alone on one side of the equation. We need to get rid of 1560. To do this, we subtract 1560 from both sides:    312*l + 1560 - 1560 = 0 - 1560    312*l = -1560 7. Finally, we want to find out what l is. To do this, we divide both sides by 312:    l = -1560 / 312 8. When we do the division, we find out that:    l = -5 So, the solution to the problem is l = -5."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:      Q: What globular protein is used in the construction of the hollow tube?   Choices:  - actin  - cyclin  - keratin  - tubulin  A: The answer is:","output":"- tubulin Based on the question asking about the globular protein used in the construction of the hollow tube, the correct answer is tubulin. Tubulin is a globular protein that assembles into microtubules, which are long, cylindrical, hollow structures. These microtubules play an essential role in various cellular activities such as cell division, intracellular transport, and maintenance of cell shape and structure. Now let's go through the other choices to understand why they are not the correct answer: - Actin: Actin is a protein that polymerizes to form actin filaments, also known as microfilaments. These filaments serve as the primary component of the cytoskeleton, contributing to cell motility, mechanical support, and the formation of cell extensions such as filopodia and lamellipodia. Although actin is involved in the structural organization of cells, it does not form hollow tubes, making it an incorrect choice. - Cyclin: Cyclin is a protein family that regulates the progression of a cell through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). They play a crucial role in the control of cell division. Unlike tubulin, cyclins are not involved in the construction of a hollow tube or in the formation of the cytoskeleton. - Keratin: Keratin is a family of fibrous structural proteins that form the primary constituent of hair, nails, horns, and other similar structures in animals. Keratins are intermediate filaments that provide structural support and mechanical strength to epithelial cells. Though keratins are an essential part of structural proteins, they do not form hollow tubes like tubulin. In conclusion, among the given choices, tubulin is the globular protein that is used in the construction of the hollow tube (microtubules), which serve various functions in cellular activities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You may be wondering, \\"What is Wi-Fi?\\" Well, Wi-Fi is a way for our computers, tablets, and phones to connect to the internet without using any wires. It's like magic! Before we start, you need to know that only grown-ups should handle setting up the Wi-Fi for you, but we still want you to understand how it works. So let's get started! 1. Click the Wi-Fi Icon. First, take a look at the bottom of your computer or tablet screen, where sometimes you can see little pictures or symbols. One of those pictures looks like a tiny radio tower with waves coming out of it. That's the Wi-Fi icon! When we click on this icon with our fingers or with the computer mouse, a whole new world opens up! It shows us a list of all the Wi-Fi networks we can connect to. Remember, it's always better to ask a grown-up to help you choose the right one. 2. Click your router's network name. Next, we have to find the network (or Wi-Fi signal) that comes from the special box called a router in your house. This box sends out the Wi-Fi magic so you can connect to the internet. Grown-ups use a special name for this box, called the \\"router's network name.\\" It's like how you have a name, and your friends have names, too. When you hear grown-ups talk about the router's network name, they might also call it an \\"SSID\\" – but don't worry about that big word, it's just another name for it! After you click on the Wi-Fi icon, you'll see a list of network names. Look for your router's network name and click on it. If you don't know the name, ask a grown-up to help you find it. 3. Enter the password. To connect to your Wi-Fi, we need a special word called a \\"password.\\" Passwords are secret words that only your family should know. Just like how superheroes have secret identities, these secret words protect your Wi-Fi from strangers. Ask a grown-up to tell you the password and then carefully type it into the box that opens up on the screen. Remember, passwords can be tricky – sometimes they have capital letters, numbers, or even funny symbols. Make sure you type it in just like your grown-up tells you to! 4. Click \\"OK.\\" Once you've typed in that secret password, you're almost ready to connect to the Wi-Fi magic! Look for a button that says \\"OK\\" or \\"Connect\\" and give it a click. After a few seconds, you should see that your computer, tablet, or phone is now connected to the Wi-Fi! Hurray! Go ahead and explore the internet with a grown-up's help, watch your favorite videos, or play some fun games. Now, you know how Wi-Fi works and how to connect your gadgets to it! As you grow older, you'll learn more about how these magical connections work. But for now, just enjoy the fun and remember to always ask a grown-up for help!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Budapest is the capital and most populous city of Hungary, one of the largest cities in the European Union and sometimes described as the primate city of Hungary.

He became an American citizen after emigrating from Europe.  - An animator is an artist who creates multiple images, known as frames, which give an illusion of movement called animation when displayed in rapid sequence. Animators can work in a variety of fields including film, television, and video games. Animation is closely related to filmmaking and like filmmaking is extremely labor-intensive, which means that most significant works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods of creating the images or frames for an animation piece depends on the animators' artistic styles and their field.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\".

This stature is found nestling amid the countryside, and it stands as an edifice dedicated to the memory of Æthelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia, an important figure in early English history. England, with its capital London, is renowned for its heritage and architectural wonders, and Dead Man's Plack stands as a unique element in its pantheon of historic monuments. London, a vibrant and dynamic city, is a blend of cultures, and its importance is not restricted to England alone but extends to global affairs. As the capital, it has been the epicenter of national and international events, with historical landmarks like the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, and the Palace of Westminster. It is also a buzzing city with modern structures like the Shard and the Gherkin. Amid these urban wonders, the existence of a historic monument like Dead Man's Plack elsewhere in the country is a reminder of England's profound history, which stretches beyond its capital city. The dedication of Dead Man's Plack to Æthelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia, signifies the reverence the country has for its ancient rulers and their significant roles in shaping the nation's destiny. Æthelwald, considered a mighty power in early England, left indelible footprints in the country's history, and his memorial in the form of Dead Man's Plack, speaks volumes about the respect attached to this historical figure. The UK, including England, is a melting pot of cultures and languages, one of which is the ancient Cornish language. Though its use has dwindled over time, it still represents an essential fragment of England's diverse linguistic heritage. This language is a Celtic one, tracing back to the ancient Britons and surviving in isolated communities in Cornwall until the late 18th century. Its resurgence in recent years as part of cultural revival efforts adds another layer to England's rich societal fabric. Lastly, the Church of England plays a prominent role in the religious landscape of the country. As the mother church of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the oldest among the Anglican provinces, the Church of England has a significant influence on the country's religious, sociocultural, and political history. It represents a cornerstone of English spiritual life, encompassing various faith spectrums from high-church Anglo-Catholic to low-church evangelical. In essence, Dead Man's Plack, situated in the heart of England, symbolizes more than just a memory of Æthelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia. It is emblematic of the rich tapestry of English history, interweaving tales of ancient ruler's mighty reign, linguistic diversity signified by the Cornish language, the spiritual fulcrum that is the Church of England, all under the overarching culture that converges in the vibrant metropolis of London, the capital city. Thus, England's rich contours of history, language, religion, and governance are etched deep into monuments like Dead Man's Plack, bringing successive generations closer to understanding their heritage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place.

Q: The unrest began when the start of voting was delayed because ballots and poll materials had not been delivered, and got worse after the discovery of stuffed ballot boxes, the UN official said.      Some 15 polling stations were set alight, a parliamentary candidate told AFP on condition of anonymity.      The town, in the central province of Kasai Oriental, is a stronghold for veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, chief rival to President Joseph Kabila in Monday's national polls.      The UN source said Kananga residents had vandalised polling stations, blocked a truck from delivering election materials and thrown stones at a primary school where voting was due to take place after they found 190 ballot papers that had been hidden. ||||| KINSHASA Nov 28 (Reuters) - Masked gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons at a polling station in Lubumbashi, the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo's Katanga mining province, the governor of the province said as presidential elections took place on Monday.      Separately, locals burnt down three polling stations in the neighbouring opposition heartland of West Kasai and an election observer was badly injured in crowd violence, Congolese electoral monitoring group RENOSEC said on Monday. ||||| Posted Monday, November 28th, 2011 at 7:15 am      Voters in the Democratic Republic of Congo have begun casting ballots in presidential and legislative elections, after violence and accusations of fraud marred the run-up to Monday's vote.      The head of the country's electoral commission said Sunday there was no evidence of fraud, after at least one opposition candidate said vote tampering was under way favoring incumbent President Joseph Kabila.      At least three people were reported killed leading up to the election.      Police in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi said gunmen attacked two election vehicles early Monday and set them on fire.      This is only the second multi-party poll since the large central African nation was torn apart by two wars following independence. The last war ended in 2003.      Mr. Kabila, who is running against 10 opposition candidates, is widely expected to win re-election. Results are expected by December 5, the day before Mr. Kabila's current term ends.      President Kabila has been in power since 2001, when he assumed the presidency after the assassination of his father, Laurent Kabila. He won a presidential vote in 2006.      His strongest challenger, long-time opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, backed down from plans to hold a rally Sunday in the capital, Kinshasa, in defiance of a ban on campaigning the day before the election. His advisers say they feared for his safety. On Saturday, Congolese police blocked Mr. Tshisekedi and his supporters from leaving the airport for several hours. They fired bullets and tear gas, killing three and wounding several more.      The capital was reported calm on Sunday, described as a “Day of Reflection” in Congo, with no gatherings of large crowds.      Mr. Tshisekedi has accused the head of the United Nation's large peacekeeping force in Congo of a bias against him. He has called for removal of mission chief Roger Meece, who once served as the U.S. ambassador in the county.      More than 18,000 candidates are vying for 500 seats in the general assembly. ||||| AFP      An armed attack and long delays have marred voting in the Democratic Republic of Congo's national elections after a campaign that saw deadly violence.      Police in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi said armed men had swooped on a convoy of eight jeeps around 3am on Monday (Noon AEDT) and fled when police escorting the vehicles opened fire, wounding some of the assailants.      Two jeeps carrying nearly 1000 ballots caught fire and burned in the attack.      Advertisement: Story continues below      The city, capital of the restive mining province of Katanga, had been a flashpoint of political violence in the run-up to the elections.      Earlier this month, two days of street fights between opposition and government supporters shut down parts of the city, as shop windows were shattered and pedestrians mugged.      On Sunday, gunmen attacked a military camp and arms depot in the city, killing one and fleeing after exchanging gunfire with soldiers.      It was not clear if either that raid or Monday's election convoy attack had any link to the partisan clashes during the campaign.      Violence also marred the run-up to the vote in the capital city of Kinshasa.      The last day of campaigning on Saturday descended into chaos as police banned all rallies, using tear gas, water cannons and live ammunition to disperse opposition supporters.      At least two people died in the unrest, although the exact circumstances were unclear. The campaign violence has drawn condemnation and calls for calm from the international community.      Incumbent President Joseph Kabila, 40, in power since 2001, is running for a new five-year term in the polls against a field of 10 challengers.      His main rival is veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, 78.      The elections are only the second since back-to-back wars from 1996 to 2003, and the country remains one of the world's poorest, despite an abundance of cobalt, copper, diamonds and gold.      Though polling stations opened on time at 6am in some areas, there were reports of undelivered ballots and long delays in others.      Logistical headaches in organising the vote in a country two-thirds the size of western Europe - and whose roads network is crumbling and limited after seven years of war and decades of under-development - had raised fears the polls could be postponed.      The election commission had to bring in 81 aircraft to deliver 64 million ballot papers to some 64,000 polling stations across the country, in a process plagued by delays.      The run-up to the vote also saw allegations of fraud against the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI), from opposition charges of \\"fictitious\\" polling stations to a leaked report by a consulting firm that said there were tens of thousands of ghost voters on the rolls.      As voting opened in the capital, small groups of voters waited outside voting office 10189 at the Saint Georges school.      The most senior official displayed the transparent ballot box, turning it upside down to prove it was empty at the start of the day. But, half an hour later, the lines of voters had not moved.      Rita, a 40-year-old mother of five, complained about the delay.      \\"The station hasn't even opened and it's 6.30,\\" she said, adding that she planned to vote \\"for change\\".      \\"We need a president who loves this country.      \\"Those who are in power reap the benefits for their own interests, and for the others, the people - zero.\\"      \\"I'm fed up. I'm voting for change,\\" echoed 19-year-old economics student Jeremie.      \\"Even buying breakfast is hard for us in the Congo, especially in Kinshasa.\\" ||||| A:","output":"In Democratic Republic of Congo's national elections, unrest and violence occurred in multiple locations.

No. The premise \\"A man, woman, and one girl face the camera, while one girl faces away\\" suggests that there is a group of four people (one man, one woman, and two girls) who are interacting, with three of them facing the camera and the fourth one facing away.

Still in the end at least he managed to travel safely to his destinati. Can we draw the following conclusion? Tony was afraid of what could happen on the flight Choices: *Yes *It's impossible to say *No","output":"Yes, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Tony was afraid of what could happen on the flight. This can be deduced from various elements mentioned in the story: 1. Tony's need to brace himself for the worst: The phrase \\"bracing himself for the worst\\" suggests that Tony was expecting something negative (or possibly even several negative incidents) to occur during the flight. This reveals a certain level of fear or anxiety regarding the conditions of the airplane or airlines he chose to fly with. 2. The cheap ticket: By emphasizing the fact that Tony booked a cheap ticket, the story is implying that the quality and the overall experience of the flight may not be up to par with more expensive options. A cheap flight could potentially result in the airline cutting corners in areas such as safety or services, which could heighten Tony's concerns about the overall experience and possible risks. 3. The long, dirty, and uncomfortable flight: It's stated that the actual conditions were subpar – the flight was long, dirty, and uncomfortable. It's likely that Tony had been aware of the possibility of experiencing a substandard flight, hence, he felt anxious about the potential of having to go through a displeasing journey.  While it hasn't been explicitly stated that Tony was afraid of what could happen on the flight, the context and clues provided in the story indicate that he did have concerns or reservations about the flight.

Translate to German: How does one perceive and/or construct a specific public sphere and positional and/or participatory model for spectatorship as opposed to (modernist) generalized ones? German:","output":"Wie nimmt man eine bestimmte Öffentlichkeit wahr und/oder konstruiert ein spezifisches Positionierungs- und/oder Partizipationsmodell für Zuschauerschaft im Gegensatz zu (modernistischen) verallgemeinerten Modellen? In dieser Frage geht es darum, wie man eine bestimmte Öffentlichkeit wahrnimmt und ein spezifisches Modell für die Zuschauerschaft entwickelt, das sich von allgemeineren, modernistischen Modellen unterscheidet. Um dies zu beantworten, können wir die verschiedenen Elemente der Frage betrachten und analysieren, wie sie in Bezug aufeinander stehen. Erstens bezieht sich \\"Öffentlichkeit\\" auf den Raum, in dem öffentliche Meinungen und Diskurse zirkulieren und in dem verschiedene gesellschaftliche Gruppen und Einzelpersonen interagieren und kommunizieren. Die Wahrnehmung und Konstruktion einer Öffentlichkeit hängen von verschiedenen Faktoren ab, darunter kulturelle, soziale und politische Aspekte. Ein spezifischer öffentlicher Raum könnte beispielsweise eine bestimmte Branche, eine Interessengruppe oder ein Thema betreffen, das für eine Gruppe von Menschen von besonderem Interesse ist. Zweitens beinhaltet ein \\"Positionierungs- und/oder Partizipationsmodell\\" die Art und Weise, wie Menschen sich innerhalb dieser Öffentlichkeit engagieren und ihre Rolle als Zuschauer wahrnehmen. Diese Modelle können je nach den Zielen, Werten und sozialen Dynamiken der verschiedenen Gruppen variieren. Ein Positionierungsmodell kann sich auf die Rolle von Individuen als passive Beobachter oder aktive Teilnehmer beziehen, während ein Partizipationsmodell stärker auf den Grad der Einbindung und Interaktion zwischen den Individuen und dem öffentlichen Diskurs abzielen.  Der Gegensatz zu modernistischen generalisierten Modellen besteht darin, dass diese oft eine universelle Öffentlichkeit und eine allgemeine, homogene Zuschauerschaft annehmen, anstatt auf die Besonderheiten und Unterschiede verschiedener Gruppen und öffentlicher Räume einzugehen. Solche verallgemeinerten Modelle können dazu führen, dass bestimmte Menschen, Perspektiven und Diskurse übersehen oder marginalisiert werden. Um einen spezifischen öffentlichen Raum und ein entsprechendes Zuschauermodell wahrzunehmen und zu konstruieren, sollte man daher eine Reihe von Schritten unternehmen: 1. Identifizierung der spezifischen Öffentlichkeit oder Gruppe, die in diesem Raum teilnehmen wird, und ihre Bedürfnisse, Interessen und Werte. 2. Analyse der kulturellen, sozialen und politischen Kontexte, in denen diese Öffentlichkeit agiert, und wie diese die Dynamik des öffentlichen Diskurses und der Zuschauerschaft beeinflussen. 3. Entwicklung eines Positionierungs- und/oder Partizipationsmodells, das die verschiedenen Rollen und Möglichkeiten zur Teilnahme am öffentlichen Diskurs für die Mitglieder dieser Öffentlichkeit berücksichtigt. 4. Berücksichtigung der Vielfalt innerhalb der Öffentlichkeit und der Möglichkeit, unterschiedliche Perspektiven und Stimmen einzubeziehen, um ein inklusives und demokratisches Modell für den öffentlichen Diskurs zu fördern. Indem man diese Schritte befolgt, kann man eine spezifische Öffentlichkeit und ein Zuschauermodell wahrnehmen und konstruieren, das sich von verallgemeinerten modernistischen Modellen abhebt und sich besser an die Bedürfnisse und Ziele der beteiligten Gruppen anpasst."},{"instruction":"Given that The Second Jungle Book: Mowgli & Baloo is a 1997 American adventure film starring Jamie Williams as Mowgli, with Roddy McDowall and Billy Campbell in supporting roles.

Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems.

Then, on Jan. 27, the Discovery Channel will unveil the video of the creature with razortoothed suckers and eyes the size of dinner plates. That's not totally an exaggeration. The giant squid is believed to have inspired centuries of legends among sailors. The squid in question is about 10 feet long—though scientists say it would have been 26 feet long had it not been missing two arms—and was taped some 2,000 feet underwater in the north Pacific. It took experts some 400 hours squeezed into a submersible to get the footage, AFP reports. It was shining and so beautiful, says a researcher of the silvery, blackeyed squid. I was so thrilled when I saw it firsthand.","output":"For centuries, sailors have recounted tales of a mythical sea creature, the Kraken, a giant squid that supposedly terrorized ships. Now, thanks to the efforts of Japan's National Science Museum, the creature has been captured on video in its natural habitat for the first time ever. The footage, which shows a 10-foot-long giant squid with razor-toothed suckers and eyes the size of dinner plates, will air on Japanese public television, and later on the Discovery Channel on January 27th. The video was taken some 2,000 feet below the surface of the north Pacific, where the elusive creatures are known to reside. And capturing it was no easy feat- experts had to spend 400 hours squeezed into a submersible to get the footage. What they captured is a breathtaking sight: a silvery, black-eyed squid that shines in the darkness of the deep sea. According to researchers, this particular giant squid is about 10 feet long- a far cry from the legendary creature that sailors spoke of, with its reported 26-foot length. However, the specimen in the video is missing two arms, so it's possible that it could have grown larger if it had not suffered this injury. Regardless of its size, the video is a major breakthrough for scientists, who have long sought to capture the giant squid on film. It's believed that the creature has inspired centuries of legends among sailors, making it all the more exciting to finally have concrete proof of its existence. As for the researchers involved in the mission, they're understandably thrilled with their accomplishment. \\"It was shining and so beautiful,\\" said one researcher of the squid. \\"I was so thrilled when I saw it firsthand.\\" Thanks to their hard work, the rest of the world will soon be able to share in that excitement."},{"instruction":"dentity documents in the United States At present, the only national photo identity documents are the passport and passport card, which are issued to U.S. nationals only upon voluntary application.

His tests found out that patient A had myopia, but patient B had normal eyesight. He referred the patient with eye condition to an ophthalmologist. But I can use this background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in schoolage children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness.

For a while, it seemed as though the Christian right had lost much of its influence on American politics. Despite having played a key role in many right-wing victories in the 80s and 90s, they have struggled to assert themselves in recent years. This is thought to be due in part to changing demographics in the country, as well as a shift in priorities among social conservatives. However, it seems that the Christian right is now regrouping and adopting new tactics in an effort to reassert itself. A key element of this strategy is returning to the roots of the movement, by focusing on issues that resonate with the religious base of the party. One issue that has been particularly important to the Christian right is abortion. Many religious conservatives view abortion as anathema, and efforts to restrict access to the procedure have been a key part of their strategy for decades. It seems that this issue is once again becoming a key focus of the movement, with new legal challenges being launched against abortion providers across the country. Another issue that is gaining prominence among the Christian right is religious freedom. Many conservatives feel that their religious rights are under threat, and are pushing back against perceived encroachments on these freedoms. This has manifested in a number of ways, including legal challenges to same-sex marriage, efforts to limit the teaching of evolution in schools, and attempts to introduce Christian prayer into public spaces. Ultimately, it remains to be seen how successful the Christian right will be in reversing its political fortunes. However, it is clear that the movement is not going to disappear any time soon. By returning to its grassroots and focusing on the issues that matter most to its religious base, the Christian right is once again making its presence felt in American politics."},{"instruction":"A Pennsylvania man who has the misfortune of bearing a strong resemblance to the suspect in the killing of a state trooper has been awarded for his troubles with a car.
